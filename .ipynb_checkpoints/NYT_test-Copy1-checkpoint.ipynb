He was 70.His wife, Gina Nanni, confirmed his death, at NYU Langone Medical Center. He had been treated for an undisclosed illness for several years and contracted pneumonia a week ago.Over the decades, Mr. O’Brien developed a kaleidoscopic career that seemed to mirror the evolution of the downtown sensibility itself.It began in 1971, when Andy Warhol hired him to work on — and shortly thereafter, edit — Interview, Mr. Warhol’s take on a celebrity magazine.

      "A former senior finance official with the City University of New York was arrested on Friday and charged with embezzlement and fraud, accused of siphoning about $81,000 from student tuition accounts, federal and state investigators said.The official, Carmine Marino, held several positions at CUNY, the nation’s largest public urban university, including director of fiscal and business operations at its School of Professional Studies, which caters to working students who take classes part-time toward undergraduate and graduate degrees. After questions arose internally about Mr. Marino’s handling of the accounts, according to the authorities, he was forced to resign in 2013. He had been working in a similar position at the University of California at Los Angeles.Mr. Marino, 43, surrendered Friday morning and appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan. The charges were announced by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, the New York State inspector general and the federal Education Department’s office of the inspector general.The charges come as CUNY is facing an array of outside investigations related to financial, management and personnel issues.As part of a broad review, the state inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, found in November that shoddy oversight and ineffective management had created a system “ripe for abuse,” which had potentially steered money away from needy students and vital campus projects. That investigation is continuing. \n",

      "In a separate inquiry, prosecutors from the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn are investigating the personal finances, among other areas, of Lisa S. Coico, the former president of the City College of New York, who resigned unexpectedly in October.Mr. Marino’s case appears unrelated to those investigations, based on court documents. He appears to have acted alone in establishing fake accounts in the names of actual university endeavors, beginning in 2008, according to the charges. He would then deposit money from university tuition accounts and withdraw funds for his own benefit, the charges say.\n",
