China, he said with a bluntness that is rare here, had fundamentally botched its policy on the divided Korean Peninsula.', '2': 'China’s bond with North Korea’s Communist leaders formed even before Mao Zedong’s decision in 1950 to send People’s Liberation Army soldiers to fight alongside them in the Korean War. Mao famously said the two sides were “as close as lips and teeth.”', '3': 'But China should abandon the stale myths of fraternity that have propped up its support for North Korea and turn to South Korea, Mr. Shen said at a university lecture last month in Dalian, a northeastern Chinese port city.', '4': '“Judging by the current situation, North Korea is China’s latent enemy and South Korea could be China’s friend,” Mr. Shen said, according to a transcript he published online. “We must see clearly that China and North Korea are no longer brothers in arms, and in the short term there’s no possibility of an improvement in Chinese-North Korean relations.”', '5': 'The speech was a strikingly bold public challenge to Chinese policy, which remains unwilling to risk a break with North Korea even as its nuclear program raises tensions in northeast Asia and beyond. The controversy over Mr. Shen’s views in China has distilled a renewed debate about whether the government should abandon its longstanding patronage of North Korea.', '6': 'China’s “traditionalist view that views the U.S. as a much greater threat than North Korea is deeply entrenched,” Bonnie S. Glaser, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in an email. “But the proponents of change are vocal, too. They argue that North Korea is a growing liability.”', '7': 'For decades, China has tried to preserve ties with North Korea as a partner and strategic shield in northeast Asia, even when the North’s leaders became testy and unpredictable. In recent years, though, China has also tried to soothe the United States, build political and business ties with South Korea and help rein in North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.', '8': 'But as North Korea has improved its missiles and nuclear warheads, opening the possibility that it could one day strike the continental United States, China’s go-between approach has become increasingly fraught.', '9': 'North Korea did not hold a nuclear test over the weekend that some had expected, and its missile test on Sunday fizzled. But more tests and launches appear to be only a matter of time, and the Trump administration has pressed China’s president, Xi Jinping, to use much tougher pressure on its neighbor.', '10': '“The era of strategic patience is over,” Vice President Mike Pence said in South Korea on Monday.', '11': '“The president and I have a great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea,” he told reporters, but “if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States and our allies will.”', '12': 'China suspended coal imports from North Korea in February, cutting off a major source of revenue for the North. But China has resisted choking off trade with North Korea, and debate over how to balance Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington has sharpened and become more fractious. Trying to stay friends with all sides is proving perilous.', '13': 'The Chinese government has fiercely objected to an American antimissile defense system, called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, being installed in South Korea, fearing it could be used to spy on China. But some Chinese experts have criticized the surge of anti-South Korean anger unleashed by Beijing as counterproductive.', '14': 'Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often defends Chinese government policy,  cautioned last week that North Korea would face harsher sanctions if it went ahead with another nuclear test. On Monday, the paper redoubled that warning, calling for China to choke off most oil supplies to North Korea if there was another test.', '15': 'Mr. Shen has gone much further than other scholars in calling for a reset.', '16': '“The fundamental interests of China and North Korea are at odds,” he said in his lecture. “China’s fundamental interest lies in achieving a stability on its borders and developing outward. But since North Korea acquired nuclear weapons, that periphery has never been stable, so inevitably Chinese and North Korean interests are at odds.”', '17': 'He derided China’s opposition to the Thaad antimissile system as shrill and self-defeating, needlessly alienating South Korean opinion. “What we’ve done is exactly what the Americans and North Koreans would like to see,” he said.', '18': 'Mr. Shen’s views have incensed Chinese ultranationalists, who have accused him of selling out the country’s ally in Pyongyang. His views and the debate about them have not been reported in Chinese state news media.', '19': 'But Mr. Shen’s speech remains on the website of the Cold War history research center at East China Normal University in Shanghai, where he works. He has also restated his views at lectures in Shanghai and, last week, in Xi’an in northwest China, he said.', '20': 'In the past, articles in China critical of North Korea have been quickly censored. In 2004, an influential Chinese policy magazine was closed down after it published an essay critical of North Korea. In 2013, an editor at a Communist Party journal in Beijing was shunted from his job for publicly proposing that China withdraw support for North Korea.', '21': 'Mr. Shen said the tolerance — so far — for his views suggested that the government might be willing to tolerate greater criticism of North Korea and debate about the relationship.', '22': '“Many people have asked me, ‘Teacher Shen, why hasn’t your speech been taken down?’” Mr. Shen said in a telephone interview from Shanghai.', '23': '“At least it shows that there can be different views about the North Korea issue. It’s up to the center to set policy, but at least you can air different views in public, whereas before you couldn’t,” he said. The “center” refers to China’s central leadership.', '24': 'Still, Ms. Glaser said, President Xi appears unlikely to turn entirely on North Korea.', '25': 'After a meeting with Mr. Xi, President Trump said his Chinese counterpart seemed willing to press Pyongyang. But China has balanced its criticisms of North Korea by pressing the United States to agree to prompt negotiations with the North and suspend major military exercises with the South.', '26': 'In South Korea on Monday, Vice President Pence held out the possibility of opening talks with the North Koreans, noting that Washington was seeking security “through peaceable means, through negotiations.”', '27': 'His office added that any talks would include Japan, South Korea, other allies in the region and China.', '28': 'Mr. Shen, 66, is well known in China and is often cited for his groundbreaking studies on the outbreak of the Korean War that used archival records to expose the tensions and miscalculations behind Mao’s decision to send troops.', '29': 'He is the son of Communist Party officials and previously used his earnings from business to pay for dredging archives in Russia, after serving a two-year prison term on a charge of leaking state secrets that he insisted was groundless.', '30': 'He said he hoped that his research, including a new history of Chinese-North Korean relations that he hopes will appear in English this year, would dismantle deceptive myths that have grown up in China around that past.', '31': '“It’s very hard for China to adjust relations,” he said. “If everyone understands the truth and this myth is burst, then there’ll be a basis among the public and officials for adjusting policy.”', '32': 'But Mr. Shen acknowledged that shifting direction on North Korea would carry risks. If political cooperation between Beijing and Washington fails to constrain North Korea, he said, the two governments should cooperate in a military response.', '33': '“If North Korea really does master nuclear weapons and their delivery, then the whole world will have to prostrate itself at the feet of North Korea,” he said in the interview. “The longer this drags out, the better it is for North Korea.”'}}, {'title': 'Spring in Transylvania: Wake Up and Splash (or Be Splashed) - The New York Times', 'date': '2017-04-19', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/europe/easter-monday-transylvania.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {'1': 'SANCRAIENI, Romania — Young men in Sancraieni have risen early on Easter Monday for as long as anyone can remember. So have the women and girls — to be soaked in ice-cold water and sprayed with patchouli.', '2': '“Sprinkling” is a spring rite in the heart of Transylvania, in central Romania, when women are watered like flowers. The water, freshly drawn from a well, is believed to secure health, beauty and perhaps even love for the women who find themselves beneath a bucketful of it.', '3': 'On Monday morning, about two dozen young men in traditional attire — high black boots, black hats, white shirts and cream-colored trousers resembling riding breeches — gathered at the home of Koppany Gal, 23, who works at a hospital. Beer and snacks were already on the table.', '4': '“It’s an important event for us,” said Mr. Gal, who has helped organize the sprinkling group in the village for nine years. Like the other men there that day, he attends a folk dance club that revives lost traditions in this part of the world.', '5': 'The men set off under gray clouds, marching through streets of single-story houses with red clay rooftops. Some carried traditional instruments; all of them were singing. They could expect to eat and drink well that day: Girls and their mothers around the village typically spend the weekend preparing pastries, drinks and snacks, including eggs colored red. The men would be welcome to all of it, all day.', '6': 'At the houses where they stopped, young women in red, black and white folkloric dress came out to listen. The men would recite a poem ending, “May I pour?”', '7': 'After one woman consented with a cheerful if predictable “yes,” two men held her as a third threw cold water from a bucket rimmed with red carnations.', '8': '“It feels good that they thought of me,” said Hajnalka Cseke, 18, who also dances in the folk group. “It’s nice to see all of us gathered here.”', '9': 'Ms. Cseke, drenched, joined her sister in picking up trays of seasonal pastries and wine and offering them to the visitors.', '10': 'Of course some women in the region dislike the tradition, viewing it as dated and even sexist. Some merely endure it, like a vexing but obligatory visit from a relative.', '11': 'There was no sign of that on Monday in Sancraieni, which stretches up from a two-lane country road that wends through a wide valley, reaching the edge of the pine forests that run up the surrounding mountains. The mostly Hungarian-speaking population here is part of a large minority of ethnic Hungarians living mostly in the Transylvania region. They call the village by a different name, Csikszentkiraly.', '12': 'Many here see the rite of sprinkling as a way to keep tradition alive. The folk dance group that counts the water-carrying men as members has revived several traditions that have disappeared or changed in urban settings.', '13': '“Events like this provide the basis for a sense of identity,” said Szilveszter Kelemen, 31, who leads the group. “If a people don’t have a culture, it ends up crumbling away.”', '14': 'In most places, traditional costumes and buckets of water have given way to contemporary Sunday best and bottles of perfume, or even spray deodorant.', '15': '“This costume is not very comfortable,” Mr. Kelemen said of his breeches and shirt. “The trousers are made of a rough material, and it stings.”', '16': 'The tradition of dousing people with water is not limited to Transylvania. It crosses Central and Eastern Europe, differing between Romania and Poland, encompassing Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.', '17': 'In Poland, the day is called Wet Monday. Elsewhere in Europe, there are water bombs and pistols; firefighters have even been seen using fire hoses. Girls in some regions receive playful strokes with a young willow branch; the boys get water thrown at them the next day.', '18': 'The poems asking for permission have become bolder, and it is now common to send them as text messages instead of actually visiting.', '19': 'The rite dates to the 18th century, but its origins are uncertain, said Hannah Foster, a curator at the Museum of Ethnography in Budapest. Many sources trace it to baptism.', '20': '“The form remains, and the devices change,” she said in a phone interview. “The tradition is kept to varying degrees from village to village, depending on the degree of isolation and the ethnic groups.”', '21': 'Easter has become secularized in most of Europe, with a steady decline in religion and churchgoing. It is a highly commercial holiday, synonymous with chocolate eggs and a long weekend. This Easter weekend, the bars and clubs in the town of Miercurea Ciuc near Sancraieni were as full as, if not fuller than, the churches.', '22': 'But in spite of modernization, urbanization and the persecution of religions under former Communist governments, sprinkling has survived.', '23': 'Children also participate in the ritual.', '24': 'Anna Kassay, 14, received a visit from classmates at the door of her apartment building. Even after being doused by six bottles of seltzer simultaneously, she thanked her visitors. “It makes me feel like I matter,” she said.', '25': 'Maria Gal, a municipal worker, was chaperoning TV crews from both Romania and Hungary who were curious to see the way her village kept its customs.', '26': 'She said traditions like sprinkling and the folk dance group helped young people preserve their identity and gave them a sense of community.', '27': 'The village, whose main business is, fittingly, water, has little else to offer. Many residents work in the factory that bottles mineral water from local springs. Others commute to Miercurea Ciuc for work, or move to Western Europe for better salaries, mostly in seasonal agriculture.', '28': 'Free movement within the European Union has given the promise of a better life to hundreds of thousands but left many local professions struggling and villages losing their youths.', '29': '“It is important to keep them from emigrating,” Ms. Gal said. “Or inspire them to come back, even if they do go to work abroad.”'}}, {'title': 'Videos Fuel Charges of Fraud in Erdogan’s Win in Turkey Referendum - The New York Times', 'date': '2017-04-19', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/europe/turkey-referendum-is-haunted-by-allegations-of-voter-fraud.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {'1': 'ISTANBUL — A village leader shoves four voting slips into a ballot box. An unknown arm marks three slips with a “yes” vote. An unknown hand adds five more. An election official validates a pile of voting slips — hours after they were meant to be validated.', '2': 'These are four of the scenes captured in unverified videos that have helped stoke accusations of voting fraud in polling stations across Turkey during Sunday’s referendum to expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.', '3': 'Mr. Erdogan’s “yes” campaign has claimed victory by a small margin — 51.4 percent to 48.6 — in a vote that further insulates the president from scrutiny and tightens his grip on one of the most influential countries in the region.', '4': 'But while Mr. Erdogan has turned his claimed victory into a political reality, the legitimacy of his win is still in question. Opposition parties say the vote was rigged. The main opposition party formally asked Turkey’s electoral commission Tuesday afternoon to reassess the contents of multiple ballot boxes and — in a separate appeal — to annul the entire poll result. And two major international observation missions have a list of concerns over irregularities during the campaign and on the day of the vote.', '5': 'One observer group said that 2.5 million votes — roughly twice the margin of victory — are under question. “It seems credible that 2.5 million were manipulated, but we are not 100 percent sure,” Andrej Hunko, a German lawmaker who observed the election on behalf of the Council of Europe, said by telephone.', '6': 'Other concerns raised by the opposition and by election observers include:', '7': '■ Suspicions of ballot-box stuffing in “almost all” of Turkey’s 165,000 ballot boxes, according to the Republican People’s Party, or C.H.P., the main opposition party.', '8': '■ A decision by the electoral commission, made during the vote itself, to significantly increase the burden needed to prove allegations of ballot-box stuffing.', '9': '■ The barring of over 170 members of the opposition from participating in election observation.', '10': '■ The temporary detainment of some international election observers, preventing them from fully observing election counts.', '11': '■ Minimal “no” votes in an opposition stronghold in southern Turkey.', '12': '■ At least one allegation of “no” votes being removed from ballot boxes and deposited in a building site in the same area of southern Turkey.', '13': '■ The unfairness of the campaign itself, which observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe described as taking place on “an unlevel playing field.”', '14': 'Turkey’s electoral commission has delayed announcing an official result, and it said it would assess allegations of fraud.', '15': 'Appeals concerning individual ballot boxes are first assessed at a local level, then at a regional level and finally by a national board. The C.H.P.’s appeal to annul the entire process will be assessed directly by the national board. Both processes, according to the commission head, are likely to be completed with 12 days.', '16': 'But there are few precedents for the annulment of electoral results in Turkey, a trend most analysts do not expect to be suddenly bucked this week.', '17': 'Sunday’s result seemed particularly unlikely to be overturned after the head of the electoral commission defended the legitimacy of the referendum in a speech.', '18': 'In the process, the commission has opened itself up to allegations of bias. “You are not a referee, you are taking sides,” Osman Baydemir, a lawmaker and spokesman for the third-largest party in Parliament, the Peoples’ Democratic Party, or H.D.P., said in a speech.', '19': 'The opposition is particularly concerned about the commission’s decision, after voting began on Sunday, to allow unvalidated ballots to be counted unless it could be proven that they were inserted into the ballot box specifically to tamper with the results.', '20': 'Turkish electoral law stipulates that ballots should be stamped by election officials and then placed in a stamped envelope before the envelope is placed in a ballot box. Unstamped papers, or papers within unstamped envelopes, are invalid by law.', '21': 'On Sunday, the commission decided otherwise, saying that similar rulings had been made in multiple elections in the past. But some legal experts said the decision had no precedent, and in fact contradicts a ruling made by the same commission in 2014. The O.S.C.E. also said the decision “undermined an important safeguard and contradicted the law that explicitly states that such ballots should be considered invalid.”', '22': 'Kerem Gulay, an expert on Turkish electoral law at the University of Amsterdam law school, said, “Changing the rules of the game after the voting started and half an hour before voting in the eastern provinces stopped — I haven’t heard of anything like that in recent electoral history worldwide.”', '23': 'Specific allegations of ballot-box stuffing emerged in the southern province of Sanliurfa. In one district, “no” voters formed less than 1 percent of the total, even though the H.D.P. won over half the votes in the area at the last parliamentary elections, in November 2015.', '24': 'Unverified photographs later emerged that seemed to show bags of “no” votes abandoned in a building site in the province. In another part of the same region, an H.D.P. lawmaker said he had witnessed multiple violations, including the stuffing of 400 ballots into a box that was only meant for 360 voters.', '25': '“Unconcealed voting, people voting multiple times, or on behalf of other people — these were widely practiced in rural Urfa,” said the lawmaker, Ibrahim Ayhan, using an informal name for the region. “And the law enforcement officers did not intervene as they should have.”', '26': 'More generally, international election observers said on Monday that the poll had not been conducted in a fair environment.', '27': 'The 24-person team from the O.S.C.E. highlighted how the poll was held amid a state of emergency that had involved tens of thousands of people being arrested, including lawmakers from the H.D.P., and over 1,500 civil society organizations being shuttered. “No” campaigners faced physical intimidation and limitations on their ability to hold rallies and access public media, the group said.', '28': 'A separate mission from the Council of Europe had similar findings. Mr. Hunko, the German lawmaker, said he had been detained by the police in southeastern Turkey, preventing him from properly observing the counting process.', '29': '“We were hindered by police forces in a way that I have never experienced in any observation mission,” said Mr. Hunko, who said he had participated in at least 15 such missions across the world.', '30': 'Mr. Hunko said the situation was particularly concerning in the southeast, where the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Kurds may have left many without a fixed address, and therefore without the right to vote. The arrest of tens of thousands of people, particularly in the Kurdish region, also cast doubt on whether the vote was free.', '31': '“Yesterday was not a free or a fair election,” Mr. Hunko added. “It was not fair generally and it was not free in part of the country, the southeast. If you have thousands in prison and they cannot vote, you cannot talk about free elections.”', '32': 'Hundreds of demonstrators have gathered in each of Turkey’s three largest cities since Sunday night to protest the alleged violations.', '33': 'Mr. Erdogan, however, rejected their concerns and those of other countries, which he described as “politically motivated.” The referendum was the “most democratic election” of any Western country, he told supporters at a rally.', '34': '“Know your place,” Mr. Erdogan said in a barb directed at foreign observers.'}}, {'title': 'In Arkansas, a Tempered Victory for Death Penalty Opponents - The New York Times', 'date': '2017-04-19', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/in-arkansas-a-tempered-victory-for-death-penalty-opponents.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {'1': 'LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Barely a dozen hours had passed since a pair of execution warrants had expired.', '2': 'The two men the State of Arkansas had wanted to put to death on Monday night remained alive. And near the State Capitol here on Tuesday afternoon, one of their lawyers was in his office, working on a court filing that he hoped would save the five men who still face execution this month.', '3': '“Honestly, my thinking was the next clients,” said Scott Braden, an assistant federal defender, recounting the hours after he spent much of Monday night at a rural prison, waiting to see whether a stay of execution would last. “We have clients coming right after that. There wasn’t a lot of time to be elated because I knew we had to be back here this morning to get ready and start working on the next clients.”', '4': 'Mr. Braden, other lawyers and a small group of allies — polling suggests more than two-thirds of Arkansas residents favor the death penalty for murder — have had some success in their resistance to the state’s plan to execute eight men over less than two weeks. Three of the eight executions have been delayed, possibly for years.', '5': 'Still, their achievement, amid international attention on the executions, was tempered, even as they filled a remarkable moment in a state with a complex history with capital punishment.', '6': '“In this fight, you have to take it a day — or, in this case, an hour — at a time,” Rita Sklar, who has been the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas for 24 years, said Monday, after Don W. Davis, one of the inmates scheduled to die that day, won a reprieve.', '7': '“We have had some significant victories,” Ms. Sklar said, “and at this point in the day, we’d call it a win.”', '8': 'In addition to Mr. Davis, courts have issued stays of execution for Bruce E. Ward, who was scheduled to die on Monday, and Jason McGehee. Both have been convicted of murder.', '9': 'But death penalty opponents face formidable opposition here. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, who set the state’s execution schedule, and the state attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, support capital punishment and have vowed to fight any last-minute legal challenges.', '10': 'The pocket of resistance has often faced skepticism, condemnation and indifference.', '11': '“This is an extreme, extreme small percentage of the Arkansas population who are actually the ones out here saying anything in opposition to the death penalty,” said State Senator Jason Rapert, a Republican who supports the state’s execution timetable.', '12': '“If the message is that you can’t come to Arkansas and take advantage of and kill innocent people without facing the possibility of the death penalty, then let that be the message,” Mr. Rapert said.', '13': 'At the prison on Monday night, a spokesman for Mr. Hutchinson spoke of the widower of Mr. Davis’s victim, who he said would “go to sleep again without that peace he was hoping to get tonight.” Ms. Rutledge, in a statement, called the day’s developments “heartbreaking” and said “families have waited far too long to see justice.”', '14': 'Few people here in Arkansas’s capital expect the state’s approach to the death penalty to shift. After Mr. Hutchinson announced the execution schedule, developed as a response to the looming expiration date of a lethal injection drug, the state became the site of measured rallies and prayer vigils, as well as courtroom clashes.', '15': '“There are clearly instances where there were demonstrations while I was governor that did not cause me to change my decision,” said Jim Guy Tucker, a Democrat who oversaw seven executions when he was governor. “I do think for those who are just unassailably or unwaveringly opposed to the death penalty under any circumstances, they do at least need to think about the actual acts these people committed and be aware that many of them still appear to be quite dangerous people.”', '16': 'The actor Johnny Depp appeared Friday at a protest on the Capitol steps that drew hundreds of people, including Damien Echols, one of the so-called West Memphis Three, men convicted in a child murder case who were freed more than five years ago in an unusual arrangement after evidence raised questions about their guilt.', '17': 'On the same day, a Circuit Court judge in Pulaski County issued one ruling, later vacated, to block the executions and joined a different protest against capital punishment. (The State Supreme Court has since forbidden the judge, Wendell Griffen, to consider cases about the death penalty, and it referred him to a disciplinary panel.)', '18': '“The majority of executions that take place in this country take place in the South,” said Jon B. Comstock, a former state judge who opposes the death penalty. “Have we ever reflected on why that is? I think we should reflect on it.”', '19': 'Arkansas has amassed a complicated record on the death penalty, despite capital punishment having been mostly absent from recent campaigns here.', '20': 'At the Cummins Unit, where Mr. Davis was to be put to death, state officials on Monday handed out manila envelopes that included a list of Arkansas executions over the last 104 years or so. The first of nearly three full pages included 66 names.', '21': 'After the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976, Arkansas was the first state to put two people to death on the same day. In 1994, it was the first state to carry out a triple execution in more than 30 years. The second triple execution since the death penalty’s reinstatement was also in Arkansas, in January 1997, when the state killed three men in about three hours.', '22': 'State officials hope to carry out double executions on Thursday and Monday, and another death sentence on April 27.', '23': 'Yet capital punishment has something of a counter-history in Arkansas, where Democrats, Republicans and independents have opposed executions and sought to slow their pace. In 1970, a Republican governor, Winthrop Rockefeller, emptied death row and commuted the sentences of the 15 prisoners who were awaiting execution.', '24': 'The contemporary reluctance over the death penalty has drawn markedly less official support. Instead, many of the protesters, some of whom gathered outside the Governor’s Mansion, have been mostly older, mostly female and mostly white. Many are involved with church groups or peace activism.', '25': '“This is a conservative state, we know that,” said Furonda Brasfield, the executive director of the Arkansas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. “There’s really no way of knowing what kind of impact we’re having, but either way, it’s important to us to speak out.”', '26': 'But the opposition’s most resonating successes have so far stemmed from the work of Mr. Braden and other lawyers, who have often subsisted on Taco Bell and Jimmy John’s. They unsuccessfully argued that the state’s compressed schedule threatened the rights of the men Arkansas would like to put to death.', '27': 'As Mr. Braden and another lawyer drove to Little Rock early Tuesday, Mr. Davis still alive despite having been offered what he planned as his last meal, they talked about the legal skirmishes that would continue just after sunrise.', '28': '“As long as there is going to be a death penalty, there is going to be a struggle,” Mr. Braden said Tuesday, when an interview was interrupted for a phone call about another appeal. “There’s going to be fights, and there’s going to be fights to the end.”'}}]\n"
