It occurred last spring at the Kaskawulsh Glacier, one of Canada’s largest, with a suddenness that startled scientists.', 3: 'A process that would ordinarily take thousands of years — or more — happened in just a few months in 2016.', 4: 'Much of the meltwater from the glacier normally flows to the north into the Bering Sea via the Slims and Yukon Rivers. A rapidly retreating and thinning glacier — accelerated by global warming — caused the water to redirect to the south, and into the Pacific Ocean.', 5: 'Last year’s unusually warm spring produced melting waters that cut a canyon through the ice, diverting more water into the Alsek River, which flows to the south and on into Pacific, robbing the headwaters to the north.', 6: 'The scientists concluded that the river theft “is likely to be permanent.”', 7: 'Daniel Shugar, an assistant professor of geoscience at the University of Washington-Tacoma, and colleagues described the phenomenon in a paper published on Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.', 8: 'River piracy has been identified since the 19th century by geologists, and has generally been associated with events such as tectonic shifts and erosion occurring thousands or even millions of years ago. Those earlier episodes of glacial retreat left evidence of numerous abandoned river valleys, identified through the geological record.', 9: 'In finding what appears to be the first example of river piracy observed in modern times, Professor Shugar and colleagues used more recent technology, including drones, to survey the landscape and monitor the changes in the water coursing away from the Kaskawulsh Glacier.', 10: 'The phenomenon is unlikely to occur so dramatically elsewhere, Professor Shugar said in a telephone interview, because the glacier itself was forming a high point in the landscape and serving as a drainage divide for water to flow one way or another. As climate change causes more glaciers to melt, however, he said “we may see differences in the river networks and where rivers decide to go.”', 11: 'Changes in the flow of rivers can have enormous consequences for the landscape and ecosystems of the affected areas, as well as water supplies.

Headley, an assistant professor of geoscience and glacier expert at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside.', 17: '“That the authors were able to capture this type of event almost as it was happening is significant in and of itself,” she said in an interview via email. As for the deeper significance of the incident, she said, “While one remote glacial river changing its course in the Yukon might not seem like a particularly big deal, glacier melt is a source of water for many people, and the sediments and nutrients that glacier rivers carry can influence onshore and offshore ecological environments, as well as agriculture.”', 18: 'Her article in Nature Geoscience concludes that this “unique impact of climate change” could have broad consequences. “As the world warms and more glaciers melt, populations dependent upon glacial meltwater should pay special attention to these processes.”', 19: 'Another glacier expert not involved in the research, Brian Menounos of the University of Northern British Columbia, said that while glaciers have waxed and waned as a result of natural forces over the eons, the new paper and his own research underscore the fact that the recent large-scale retreat of glaciers shows humans and the greenhouse gases they produce are reshaping the planet. “Clearly, we’re implicated in many of those changes,” he said.'}}, {'title': 'Prince Harry Says He Sought Counseling Over His Mother’s Death', 'date': '2017-04-18', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/world/europe/uk-prince-harry-death-princess-diana.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {1: 'LONDON — Prince Harry has said in a new interview that he suffered for years after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, before finally getting help about three years ago at the urging of his elder brother, Prince William.', 2: 'The candid statement by the prince, in a podcast released on Monday by The Daily Telegraph, is the latest indication of a shift within the British monarchy toward greater openness, led by a younger generation. The two princes, along with Prince William’s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, are leading a campaign called Heads Together to end stigma around mental illness.', 3: 'Prince Harry, 32, said that not dealing with the trauma had contributed to years of “total chaos” in his late 20s.', 4: '“I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,” he said.', 5: 'He added: “I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.”', 6: 'The exchange, a rare glimpse into the private life of a member of the royal family, drew applause from advocates for people with mental illness.', 7: 'Others praised the prince for speaking out about grief.', 8: 'Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, at age 36; she and Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, had divorced the previous year. The reaction to the violent, unexpected death became a symbol of emotional and generational conflicts, and a turning point in the royal family’s relationship with ordinary Britons.', 9: 'For several days, Queen Elizabeth II maintained her predecessors’ traditional — critics would say stony — reserve. But as people worldwide mourned Diana, who had been distinguished by her charisma and poise, Buckingham Palace came under criticism for its silence, and the queen finally broke her silence by making a live broadcast to the nation acknowledging the “overwhelming expression of sadness” and praising her former daughter-in-law as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”', 10: 'In the podcast, Prince Harry said he had tried to cope with the tragedy by not talking about it.', 11: '“My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?” he said. He recalled thinking: “ ‘It’s only going to make you sad; it’s not going to bring her back.’ So from an emotional side, I was like, ‘Right, don’t ever let your emotions be part of anything.’ ”', 12: 'Prince Harry, who spent 10 years in the British armed forces and served two tours in Afghanistan, said in the interview that his struggles had consumed much of his 20s. (He was 27 in 2012, when tabloids published images of him naked while partying in Las Vegas, which prompted him to apologize for having “let my family down.”)', 13: 'The prince also praised the virtues of getting professional help.', 14: '“Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever — the Americans call them shrinks — someone you have never met before,” he said. “You sit down on the sofa and say: ‘Listen, I don’t actually need your advice. Can you just listen?’ And you just let it all rip.”', 15: 'Asked about counseling, he said he had received it “more than a couple of times, but it’s great.”', 16: 'He credited his brother with telling him: “‘Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you.’”', 17: 'Prince Harry also said that boxing had helped.', 18: '“That really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone, so being able to punch someone who had pads was certainly easier,” he said.', 19: 'He added that staying quiet about emotional suffering in distress was “only ever going to make it worse,” and he urged people in such situations to seek help. “You will be surprised, firstly, how much support you get,” he said.', 20: 'Prince Harry spoke to Bryony Gordon, a British journalist who has written about her own struggles with depression and with obsessive compulsive disorder. The prince was the first guest on the podcast “Mad World,” in which Ms. Gordon interviews a series of people about their mental health.', 21: 'He had said that he regretted not discussing his mother’s death earlier in an interview last year.', 22: 'This year, Prince Harry and Prince William announced that they had commissioned a statue at Kensington Palace of their mother to commemorate the 20th anniversary of her death.', 23: 'As well as the Heads Together campaign, Prince Harry has also co-founded a charity to support children in Lesotho, where he spent time before joining the military, and created the Invictus Games, a sporting event for wounded or sick service members.'}}, {'title': 'Brooklyn Walkway to Reopen, With Less Bounce in Your Steps', 'date': '2017-04-18', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/nyregion/brooklyn-squibb-park-bridge-reopening.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {1: 'After years of delay, litigation, false promises and confusion, the bouncy bridge of Brooklyn Heights is set to reopen — with a lot less bounce — on Wednesday morning.', 2: 'The troubled 450-foot Squibb Park Bridge, a pedestrian shortcut from Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park, was designed to mimic the light, airy trail bridges found in state parks, bouncing slightly underfoot.', 3: 'But after its opening in the spring of 2013, the structure’s bounce went from slight to conspicuous, with the bridge also swaying from side to side, worrying users. When it closed abruptly in August 2014, the bridge, which resembles an elongated W, was visibly distorted as well.', 4: 'What was billed as a temporary closing dragged on for months, then years, as a successful fix eluded the bridge’s designer, a noted engineer named Ted Zoli, the recipient of a MacArthur grant. Compounding the problem was the fact that the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, which operates the park, was strangely reticent about the exact nature of the trouble and what was being done to address it.', 5: 'More than two years after the bridge closed, park officials declared the pedestrian structure “inherently flawed.” At the same time, officials announced they were bringing a lawsuit against HNTB, the engineering firm where Mr. Zoli is the chief bridge engineer, charging breach of contract and professional misconduct.', 6: 'The bridge was closed for 32 months, nearly twice the amount of time it was open, an embarrassment for leaders of the enormously popular park whose 1.3-mile expanse along the East River is still being developed. But now, after $2.5 million in repairs for a bridge that originally cost $4.1 million, officials say the bridge is safe and ready for a comeback.', 7: '“People love the bridge, both for its utility and its aesthetic and its bounce,” said David Lowin, vice president for real estate at the corporation, who until recently served as its interim president. “We were very, very happy that we were able to find a solution that keeps the bridge in place.”', 8: 'Despite assurances from officials that the bounce was still palpable, the engineering firm that oversaw the retrofit has toned it down significantly: The movement underfoot registers as more of a vibration now.', 9: 'Of course, not everyone liked the bounce. Some residents said it made them feel queasy; others found it frightening. More than a few avoided the shortcut offered by the bridge, which starts at Squibb Park, an expanse of asphalt at Columbia Heights and Middagh Street, and zigzags over Furman Street down to Brooklyn Bridge Park.', 10: 'That was especially true once the bridge, which is fashioned of black locust, steel and concrete, started to gyrate and appear out of kilter. Mr. Zoli, the designer, later admitted in a memorandum to park officials that one part of the bridge “twisted toward the south,” while another “twisted toward the north.”', 11: 'Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor for the city who is chairwoman of the park corporation’s board, said the park was determined to pursue repairs, even as the lawsuit inched along.', 12: '“I didn’t want the litigation to impede our ability to move forward and get this bridge open as soon as possible,” Ms. Glen said. “This is such a great amenity to the neighborhood. It was better to spend the money necessary to fix the bridge and then try to recover as much money as possible.”', 13: 'When HNTB was trying to design a solution for the bridge, park officials estimated that the repairs would cost about $700,000. In fact, the final repair work will run nearly four times that much. Ms. Glen said she was confident that “at the end of the day, we will recover a significant portion of the costs.”', 14: 'In early 2016, in announcing it would seek $3 million in damages against HNTB, the park corporation said it would bring in Arup, an international engineering firm. Arup had been hired to conduct the peer review of the earlier efforts by HNTB to fix the bridge. After it replaced HNTB, Arup devised its own retrofit intended to increase stability and reduce movement.', 15: 'To improve stability, engineers clamped the cable that runs beneath the bridge to the diagonal timber trusses that line the two center spans. Originally, that cable slid freely through plastic sleeves attached to the trusses. In addition, bolts were added to each truss to secure the steel caps at their ends; previously, the caps were attached only with epoxy.', 16: 'Finally, Arup placed a series of large tuned mass dampers — similar to shock absorbers on a car — on the underside of the bridge to control the bounce.', 17: '“As people walk across the bridge, their motion causes the tuned mass dampers to vibrate, and that vibration causes energy to be dissipated,” said Tom Wilcock, an associate principal at Arup. “The bridge is bouncing less than half of what it was before.”', 18: 'As she led visitors across the bridge in a pink hard hat, Pat Kirshner, vice president for capital operations at the park corporation, seemed to anticipate the public’s first question. “There’s still a spring in your step,” she said. “You can quote that.”', 19: 'Most likely, the general public will not notice the retrofits, which are underneath the bridge. “It’s quite subtle in terms of the visual impact on the structure,” Mr. Wilcock said.', 20: 'One of the harshest critics of the corporation during the bridge’s long closing was Daniel L. Squadron, a state senator whose district includes Brooklyn Bridge Park. He had demanded a detailed accounting of the bridge’s defects, faulting officials for what he called a lack of transparency. But last week, Mr. Squadron focused less on the bridge’s troubled history than on its imminent reopening.', 21: '“Squibb Bridge was a great amenity the first time around, and it’s good to see it bounce back for Round 2,” Mr. Squadron said in an interview. “The delay was frustrating, but I know that it will immediately become part of the fabric of this community again. I’ll take less bounce for more safety, any day.”'}}, {'title': 'Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove', 'date': '2017-04-17', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/business/dealbook/steve-ballmer-serves-up-a-fascinating-data-trove.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {1: 'Guess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It’s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.', 2: 'But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.', 3: 'When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized “I don’t, quote, ‘have anything to do.’”', 4: 'As he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the Clippers — his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.', 5: '“But come on, doesn’t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?” Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.', 6: 'Her answer: “A, it won’t, because there are things government doesn’t get to, and B, you’re missing it.”', 7: 'Mr. Ballmer replied, “No, I’m not.”', 8: 'That conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to “figure out what the government really does with the money,” Mr. Ballmer said. “What really happens?”', 9: 'On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments.', 10: 'Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That’s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.', 11: 'Mr. Ballmer calls it “the equivalent of a 10-K for government,” referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.', 12: '“You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I’d get their 10-K and read it,” he told me in a recent interview in New York. “It’s wonky, it’s this, it’s that, but it’s the greatest depth you’re going to get, and it’s accurate.”', 13: 'In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer’s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.', 14: '“I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,” Mr. Ballmer said. “People can disagree about what to do — I’m not going to tell people what to do.” But, he said, people ought to base their opinions “on common data sets that are believable.”', 15: 'So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation’s data?', 16: 'Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.', 17: 'His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. “My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,” he said. “And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing.”', 18: 'But neither option led him to what he was looking for.', 19: '“You’ve got to look at federal, state and local together,” Mr. Ballmer said. “Because I’m a citizen, I don’t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what’s going on.”', 20: 'With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.', 21: '“Let’s say it costs three, four, five million a year,” he said. “I’m happy to fund the damn thing.”', 22: 'For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.', 23: '“I love this one!” he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. “Don’t look, don’t look!” He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.', 24: '“How many people work for government in the United States?” he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. “Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?”', 25: '“Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’” Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. “Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.” And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.', 26: '“And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?” Mr. Ballmer continued. “Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.”', 27: 'Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste suddenly start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.', 28: '“Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,” Mr. Ballmer said.', 29: 'His other big surprises?', 30: '“Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,” Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. “I mean it’s funny, but I didn’t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.”', 31: 'Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his preconceived notions could change his own politics.', 32: 'At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, “If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they’re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn’t thought about them.”', 33: '“Take the mortgage deduction,” he continued. “This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.”', 34: 'One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.', 35: 'For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: “You know it’s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.”', 36: 'There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, “along with other data, but not a total,” he said. “I can’t show it! I’m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can’t report the data.”', 37: 'Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.', 38: '“We’re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — I think of this as another,” he said, referring to himself and his wife. “I don’t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don’t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it’s a civic contribution more than anything else.”'}}, {'title': 'Review: A Star Is Born (and Born and Born) in ‘Groundhog Day’', 'date': '2017-04-18', 'source': 'NYT', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/theater/groundhog-day-review-andy-karl.html?ref=todayspaper', 'content': {1: 'Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Andy Karl in “Groundhog Day,” the dizzyingly witty new musical from the creators of “Matilda.” Portraying a man doomed to relive a single day over and over and over again in a small town that becomes his custom-fitted purgatory, Mr. Karl is so outrageously inventive in ringing changes on the same old, same old, that you can’t wait for another (almost identical) day to dawn.', 2: 'That might also be said of the bounteous surrounding production that opened on Monday night at the August Wilson Theater, which features songs by Tim Minchin and is directed by Matthew Warchus (collaborators on “Matilda”), with a book by Danny Rubin. Based on Harold Ramis’s 1993 movie, “Groundhog Day” reimagines a much-loved film about instant karma with such fertile and feverish theatrical imagination that you expect to it implode before your eyes.', 3: 'Perhaps that accounts for the gremlins that have plagued this show in its previews. Mr. Karl injured his knee near the end of Friday night’s performance and finished the show with a walking stick. (His opening-night costume was to include a knee brace.) And during the critics’ preview I attended on Thursday, a technical glitch stopped the show in the first act — during a car chase number, if you please, of particularly intricate mayhem.', 4: 'It sort of made sense. How many blazingly bright ideas can a single musical contain before it sets fire to itself? The 10-minute delay was a bummer, and I wondered if this cartoon-colored production, designed as a whirling wonderland by Rob Howell, would regain its momentum.', 5: 'But then, hallelujah, the curtain rose again, and there was Mr. Karl, back in the driver’s seat (literally). And when he crossed himself, Roman Catholic-style, before beginning again the song we’d just heard — a drunken country-western rouser called “Nobody Cares” — he had us back in the palms of his never-idle hands. He had evidently taken to heart the show’s lesson that improvisation is the mother of redemption, a tenet surely to be tested by his injury.', 6: 'Such infectious quick thinking was also the hallmark of the leading man of the original film, which was written by Mr. Rubin and Mr. Ramis. I mean, of course, Bill Murray, a comedy star with a peerless gift for leavening snark with a pinch of sentimentality. You would think that in any adaptation of the movie, the biggest shadow would be cast not by its weather-predicting title critter but by Mr. Murray.', 7: 'Yet while you’re in the presence of Mr. Karl, which, thankfully, is for most of the show, he unconditionally owns the role of Phil Connors. Phil is a burned-out TV weatherman who winds up, through a bolt of metaphysical magic, being forced to relive the same day in the snug little town of Punxsutawney, Pa. (That’s the home of the celebrity groundhog, also named Phil, whose Feb. 2 sighting, or not, of his shadow is said to foretell the duration of the winter.)', 8: 'In translating this story to the stage, this production plies the bold but risky idea of making entrapment in a hick burg feel like being caught in an all-too-chipper song-and-dance show, the kind of musical that makes people allergic to musicals. The citizens of Punxsutawney are first discovered prancing and crooning in ways you might at first mistake for a parody of the sentimental earnestness of another of this season’s arrivals, “Come From Away.”', 9: 'Think of it: Perky, folksy people singing, forever and ever, about the pride of belonging to “a little town with a heart as big as any town” on an endlessly rotating stage. And you thought the characters in Sartre’s “No Exit” had it bad.', 10: 'But this show, like the movie that inspired it, is to Groundhog Day what “A Christmas Carol” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” are to Christmas. And during the production’s two and a half very full hours, Phil gradually trades in his cynicism for a grateful acceptance of life’s simpler pleasures. These, of course, include the love of a good woman, who, in this case, is a morally grounded young television producer named Rita Hanson, charmingly embodied and sung by Barrett Doss, who provides ballast without being boring.', 11: 'It’s Phil’s journey more than his destination that makes “Groundhog Day” such joy, as Mr. Karl — previously seen as the punch-drunk title contendah of the “Rocky” musical — gives many-splendored life to each faltering on the road to self-discovery. Anger, prickliness, outrage, wonder, godlike omnipotence, drunken what-the-hell exhilaration, suicidal angst, Zen-like resignation — Mr. Karl turns these different feelings into a replete gallery of self-portraits, drawn with both comic panache and genuine feeling.', 12: 'He uses every tool in the musical arsenal, too, often to devastating effect. Even his antic dancing traces a precise evolution of character. (Peter Darling, of “Billy Elliot” fame, did the choreography, with Ellen Kane.) And his pliable baritone covers the waterfront of emotions, from sardonic, pattering blitheness (“Small Town, USA”) to heavy-metal despair (the paradoxically titled “Hope”).', 13: 'The insanely talented Mr. Minchin writes songs in many shades, though he’s probably most at home where shadows lurk. As in “Matilda,” his undulating melodies and whip-smart lyrics tap into the brooding sides of the supporting characters, extending the reach of existential anxiety beyond Phil’s solipsism.', 14: 'There are unexpectedly poignant solos for supporting characters, like the town beauty (Rebecca Faulkenberry) and a bereaved insurance salesman (John Sanders). And the riotous “Nobody Cares,” in which Phil goes driving drunk with a couple of barflies (Andrew Call and Raymond J. Lee, both hilarious), becomes an ingeniously staged exercise in hedonistic hopelessness. (Let’s pray that glitch is fixed permanently.)', 15: 'Will Broadway audiences be willing to follow “Groundhog Day” into its darkest corners? (A repeated suicide sequence is a demonic doozy.) The bigger problem for many might be the plenitude of styles in which the movie traffics. The show is tighter and more consistent than when I saw it at the Old Vic in London (where the show and Mr. Karl picked up Olivier Awards). But it could still shed a number or two, including a long sequence in which Phil consults various fraudulent doctors.', 16: 'But Mr. Karl is a very persuasive guide to the show’s mercurial moods. And as he maps out the many phases of Phil, New York audiences have the rare chance to witness the full emergence of a newborn, bona fide musical star. Thanks to his character’s successive reincarnations, Mr. Karl is giving not one but many of the best performances of the season.'}}]\n"
