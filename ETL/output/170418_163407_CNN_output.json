He has many traffic violations but no criminal record, Williams said.", "34": "\"Obviously, he's got deep, deep issues,\" the chief said.", "35": "As Cleveland police and the FBI were searching for Stephens, more than 300 tips poured into the department, police said.", "36": "'If you see me again, it'll be a miracle'", "37": "Stephens' mother, Maggie Green, said the oldest of her three children came by her house Saturday afternoon.", "38": "\"He said this (was) the last time I was going to see him,\" recalled Green, 53.", "39": "Green, a former clerk at the Justice Center Complex in Cleveland who is now on disability, said the conversation confused her.", "40": "\"If you see me again, it'll be a miracle,\" she quoted him as saying.", "41": "Green learned about the shooting when her youngest son told her about the video.", "42": "She was \"just dumbfounded\" and called Stephens. He told her he was \"shooting people\" because he was \"mad with his girlfriend\" of about three years, she said, explaining it was a brief phone call because her phone died.", "43": "The woman believed to be associated with the suspect has told multiple news agencies that she was \"overwhelmed\" by the tragedy.", "44": "\"Steve really is a nice guy... He is generous with everyone he knows. He was kind and loving to me and my children,\" she told CBS News.", "45": "Williams said police have spoken to her, and she is safe and cooperating with the investigation.

No question: it is.", "4": "Given that live broadcast via social media is here to stay, with Facebook as just the beginning, there's really no easy way to prevent the next fame-hungry criminal from simulcasting a senseless act of violence.", "5": "But there is a way to do something about it: Use the law to deter this sort of depraved predator. We can criminalize the criminal's act of broadcasting his crime.", "6": "The sad truth is killers have long sought the media spotlight \u2014 including live television \u2014 well before the advent of Facebook, the iPhone, or even the Internet.", "7": "Do you know who the first live television murder victim was? (Hint: It happened in the early sixties. And you've definitely heard of him before.)", "8": "It was Lee Harvey Oswald, John F. Kennedy's assassin. But he appeared in the TV shooting as a victim -- not as the killer.  After his capture, on November 24, 1963, Oswald was being perp-walked through Dallas police headquarters past live television cameras. Jack Ruby emerged from the crowd and fatally shot him. The images went \"viral\" in newspapers and on TV long before going viral was a thing.", "9": "Jack the Ripper did not have Snapchat or Periscope in the late 1880s, so he mocked London law enforcement with handwritten letters. One of these missives dared the authorities to \"Catch me when you can,\" and included part of a victim's kidney.", "10": "In short, for as long as there has been an audience \u2014 digital, analog, even cave drawings \u2014 a certain species of assailant has been motivated to maximize the impact on society of his or her acts of violence by making sure as many people as possible will know about them. The Internet has just, unfortunately, opened up a vast audience.", "11": "Ask anyone who works in the juvenile justice system. Kids were early adopters of viral violence videos. Sometimes it's a planned assault on a victim in the hall at school (a co-conspirator tapes the sucker punch of the victim), or a fight that breaks out in the lunchroom, recorded with phones by other kids, as they egg on the combatants so they can get better video out of the event.", "12": "When it gets into the realm of a horrendous crime like the recent shooting, what is to be done? As heretical as it is for a criminal defense attorney like myself to say, deterrence could help. More criminal legislation: enhancements, penalties, mandatory minimums.", "13": "And how the crime and its victims are legally framed is key. Whether it's murder or simple assault, acts of violence that are also posted online create additional victims in the audience: the public at large.  Broadcasts of intentional violence intimidate a civilian population, just as terrorism does.", "14": "Additionally, the law has long targeted those who seek fame or profit from their crimes. In 1976, David Berkowitz went on a killing spree in New York that left six people dead.  While the murders were still unsolved, Berkowitz taunted the police and media with letters he signed \"The Son of Sam.\"  Soon after his capture, New York passed legislation to prevent any profit from the sale of killers' stories.", "15": "The challenge here is that criminalizing Facebook broadcasts of one's crimes does potentially infringe upon one's freedom of speech about those crimes. The US Supreme Court held that the original Son of Sam law ran afoul of the First Amendment, because the suppression of speech was not narrowly tailored enough.", "16": "However, the First Amendment has plenty of limits, and today, almost all the states and the federal government have laws prohibiting those criminals who plan to profit from their crimes from doing so. The ability to profit still shouldn't be constitutionally-protected.", "17": "A law would look like this: It would provide increased penalties for crimes in which the perpetrator intentionally causes the acts to be recorded, and then additionally places them into the social media public forum.  It's easy to define, and even easier to prove with the actual video evidence.", "18": "It's a tougher question whether \"killing videos\" could be additionally penalized as obscenity.  This is because the term \"obscenity\" generally applies to depictions of sexual acts. The Supreme Court has held that violence alone is not obscenity.", "19": "On the other hand, obscenity may extend to deviant acts that are not sexual, and images of extreme cruelty alone could possibly be obscene, as evidenced by a case involving videos of animal cruelty.  Indeed, \"animal crush videos\" \u2014 which are every bit as horrific as they sound \u2014 may be outlawed, even if sexual activity is not depicted.", "20": "Criminalizing the broadcast of crimes like Robert Godwin's shooting death is doable. It won't prevent these attacks, but it will deter them. Unfortunately, the technology for personal broadcasts will only continue to improve and increasingly entice fame-hungry killers.", "21": "The perverse upside is that social media creates a treasure trove of evidence:  the criminals of social media may harm the society that views them, but they often assist the authorities in prosecuting them.", "22": ""}}, {"title": "Prince documents unsealed: No meds in home were prescribed to him - CNN.com", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/17/health/prince-death-investigation-documents/index.html", "source": "CNN", "date": "2017-04-17", "content": {"1": "(CNN)None of the medications found in Prince's home following his death last year were prescribed to him, according to court documents unsealed Monday.", "2": "Bottles of opioid painkillers -- some prescribed to Prince's former drummer and longtime friend Kirk Johnson -- were found in several places in Paisley Park, and many medications were found in vitamin pill bottles and in envelopes, search warrants showed.", "3": "Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg said he wrote an Oxycodone prescription for Prince under Johnson's name for privacy purposes, according to a search warrant that was among the documents unsealed.

'I need to show this to the kids in school. These 10- and 11-year-olds need to hear about these people.'\"", "7": "The next week, all of O'Connor's classes watched the show. His students loved it, and he loved the discussion sparked by each Hero's work and the issues they were tackling.", "8": "One student suggested they write to them, and O'Connor ended up mailing hundreds of letters to CNN Heroes in locations across the globe.

It was this principle that established the world's first agricultural research station some 150 years ago when the founders of Rothamsted saw the potential of the agricultural land surrounding London to supply a growing urban population. In the 21st century, the whole world can be your bread basket.", "6": "Many are conscious of what they eat -- both from a health and environmental perspective.", "7": "But what is the impact of this? We're increasingly encouraged to eat less meat to tackle climate change. And meat consumption, in the European Union at least, has reduced and stabilized at around 42m tonnes over the last 15 years.", "8": "There are also now new labels for different types of meat eaters: flexitarians (only eat meat sometimes) or the reducetarian (aim to eat less meat) that reflect the ways different groups are trying to cut down.", "9": "But what about all those fruit, vegetable and staples crossing the globe -- can we really label them as more sustainable than eating meat?", "10": "The growth of ethical food purchases now make up close to 10% of grocery purchases in the UK, which is double that of tobacco. But in addition to the impact of air miles, global land and resource use determine the sustainability of the food we eat -- food production can destroy or displace natural resources in order to supply growing demand. Changing land use to expand avocado production in Mexico, for example, is displacing the rainforest. Or the devastating impact of non-certificated palm oil, used in food but also a whole host of other products.", "11": "And then there is the issue of food wastage.", "12": "Measuring the sustainability of food", "13": "However, the first thing we need to be able to do is measure the environmental impact of the food we eat. We can do this for different food supply chains using carbon footprinting methods. The difficulty is that consumers choose foods based on what they like -- and this frequently changes but rarely considers the impact of climate change.", "14": "From this we can say that a vegetarian diet does deliver a decreased carbon footprint. But it also shows us that food miles and global distribution can be the least of our problems.", "15": "This is because food wastage can be up to 20% of food purchases and food losses across the supply chain can be far greater than this. Food waste in turn increases the carbon footprint which counters the positive gains. And perishable fresh fruit and vegetables are more likely to be thrown away than fresh meat and fish.", "16": "So is vegetarian really best?", "17": "Ultimately, we cannot say that eating a vegan or vegetarian or meat diet is any better for the environment.", "18": "This is because all can be appropriate if production systems are sustainable, there is no waste and positive health outcomes are achieved. There are clearly trade-offs in choosing foods. Air freighting of green beans from Kenya into the UK was seen as unsustainable because of air miles but it also supports up to 1.5m people and livelihoods in some of the poorest regions of Sub-Saharan Africa.", "19": "It's not just meat that increase greenhouse gases. Rice -- produced on 163m hectares, around 12% of the global arable area -- has one of the greatest plant carbon footprints because it produces a lot of methane.", "20": "But a fall in production of rice is not only unlikely, it could also disrupt greenhouse gases held in the soil. But there are different ways to do things -- draining off paddies at particular times in the growing season, for example. Or using different fertilizers or rice varieties that are less susceptible to the heat.", "21": "The best way forward?", "22": "Consumers need to understand trade-offs and to keep up to date on information of what is best to buy.", "23": "It is important to spot food trends, for example, and project any sustainability impacts. The number of gluten-free products available is doubling year-on-year in Europe and the US. This has resulted in an increase in the consumption of plant proteins from beans and lentils.", "24": "These kinds of foods are arguably more eco-friendly than meat but -- whatever your thoughts about gluten-free eating -- it will change how protein crops are distributed globally and may divert pulses or increase the price of them for countries such as India that depend of non-livestock proteins.", "25": "Sustainability certifications have changed how we shop, giving us guidance on ethical purchases including sustainable fishing, rainforest produce and so on. This is one way to make sure that what you eat is less damaging and/or helps sustain livelihoods and good agricultural practices.", "26": "But it is day-to-day food waste -- both at home and in supply chains -- that can make any diet unsustainable whether you choose to be vegan, vegetarian, a meat eater or a combination of these. Different preservation formats can reduce food waste to zero. In the case of frozen food we know food waste can be halved compared with fresh foods -- less of it is thrown away.", "27": "Despite what you might think, frozen compares well to fresh and can be just as nutritious.", "28": "We all choose foods based on what we like, what we can access and what we can afford. But continued surveillance and interest in sustainable production will mean we can buy produce we know has a better supply chain. There isn't currently a certification that shows food produced with less waste (there should be), but we can aim to cut down our own and keep up with suppliers who show better commitments.", "29": "We might have an avocado -- but maybe not five in a week.", "30": "And of course we can source more food locally and seasonally as well as considering preserved options if we want to cut down on air miles.", "31": "Like eating less meat, there are ways to make your footprint better.", "32": "", "33": "Copyright 2016 The Conversation.

And there's nothing black or white about organic agriculture.", "5": "For a paper published this month in the journal Science Advances, we systematically and rigorously evaluated the performance of organic versus conventional agriculture on three key fronts -- environmental impact, producer and consumer benefits.

We also examined whether those studies agree or disagree in their verdicts.", "6": "We discovered that organic farming does matter -- just not in the way most people think.", "7": "Environmental impacts", "8": "Compared to a neighboring conventional farm, an organic farm at first appears to be better for the environment. But that's not the whole story. Here's how it breaks down.", "9": "What's good: Organic farms provide higher biodiversity, hosting more bees, birds and butterflies. They also have higher soil and water quality and emit fewer greenhouse gases.", "10": "What's not-so-good: Organic farming typically yields less product -- about 19-25% less. Once we account for that efficiency difference and examine environmental performance per amount of food produced, the organic advantage becomes less certain (few studies have examined this question). Indeed, on some variables, such as water quality and greenhouse gas emissions, organic farms may perform worse than conventional farms, because lower yields per hectare can translate into more environmentally damaging land-clearing.", "11": "Consumer benefits", "12": "The jury's still out on whether the consumer is better off, too.", "13": "What's good: For consumers in countries with weak pesticide regulations, like India, organic food reduces pesticide exposure. Organic ingredients also most likely have slightly higher levels of some vitamins and secondary metabolites.", "14": "What's not-so-good: Scientists can't confirm whether these minor micronutrient differences actually matter for our health. Because the difference in the nutritional value of organic and conventional food is so small, you'd do better just eating an extra apple every day, whether it's organic or not. Organic food is also more expensive than conventional food at present and therefore inaccessible to poor consumers.", "15": "Producer benefits", "16": "Organic methods bring certain benefits for farmers, some costs and many unknowns.", "17": "What's good: Organic agriculture is typically more profitable -- up to 35% more, according to a meta-analysis of studies across North America, Europe and India -- than conventional farming. Organic also provides more rural employment opportunities because organic management is more labor-intensive than conventional practices. For workers, though, the biggest advantage is that organic decreases their exposure to toxic agrochemicals.", "18": "What's not-so-good: We still don't know whether organic farms pay higher wages or offer better working conditions than conventional farms. Organic farm workers are most likely exploited in similar ways as those tilling the fields on conventional farms.", "19": "The takeaway", "20": "In short, we cannot determine yet whether organic agriculture could feed the world and reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture while providing decent jobs and giving consumers affordable, nutritious food.", "21": "It's a lot to ask of one industry, and there are still just too many unanswered questions. Some of these questions relate to agriculture, such as whether organic farms can eventually close the yield gap with conventional farms and whether there are enough organic fertilizers to produce all the world's food organically.", "22": "But some questions are also about humanity's collective future. Can people in the rich world learn to change our diet and reduce food waste to avoid having to increase food production as the global population grows? And are enough people willing to work in agriculture to meet the needs of labor-intensive organic farms?", "23": "A more useful question is whether we should continue to eat organic food and expand investment in organic farming. Here the answer is a definitive yes.", "24": "Organic agriculture shows significant promises in many areas. We would be foolish not to consider it an important tool in developing more sustainable global agriculture.", "25": "Only 1% of agricultural land is organically farmed worldwide. If organic land continues to expand at the same rate that it has over the past decade, it will take another century for all agriculture to be organic.", "26": "But organic farming's influence goes far beyond that 1% acreage. Over the past 50 years, organic farms have provided conventional agriculture with examples of new ways to farm and acted as a testing ground for a different set of management practices, from diversifying crop rotations and composting to using cover crops and conservation tillage. Conventional agriculture has neglected these sustainable practices for too long.", "27": "So yes, you should identify and support those organic farms that are doing a great job of producing environmentally friendly, economically viable, and socially just food. Conscientious consumers can also push to improve organic farming where it is not doing so well -- for example on yields and worker rights.", "28": "As scientists, we must close some of the critical knowledge gaps about this farming system to better understand its achievements and help address its challenges.", "29": "But in the meantime, everyone can learn from successful organic farms and help improve the other 99% of agriculture that's feeding the world today.", "30": "", "31": "Copyright 2016 The Conversation.

And although women were traditionally not allowed to participate in the ceremony, in Puebla they often serve as voladores and even the caporal.", "12": "Instead of commemorating various gods, the Nahua perform the dance only on holidays commemorating a particular town's patron saint.
