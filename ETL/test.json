Putin, when he talks about it at all, tends to refer to Syria as an accomplished victory, yet hedges a bit. \u201cWe did indeed withdraw a substantial portion of our forces,\u201d Mr. Putin said in response to a question on his live national call-in show on Thursday. \u201cBut we made sure that after our withdrawal, the Syrian Army would be in a fit state to carry out serious offensives itself, with our remaining forces\u2019 support.\u201d", "3": "That support, according to numerous military analysts and diplomatic sources, amounts to virtually the same level of engagement since Russia first deployed in Syria in September. The tenor has changed, however. Syria is gradually becoming another more secretive, hybrid war of the sort that fits into Mr. Putin\u2019s comfort zone, they said.", "4": "Russia\u2019s agenda in Syria at the moment is a tightrope act. It wants to keep enough forces engaged in Syria to ensure it can influence any political transition, so that Damascus remains a client. Yet, it does not want to become visibly mired in a messy, prolonged war, as American officials predicted it would.", "5": "\u201cThe level of Russian involvement in Syria is relatively high, and includes a wide range of assistance to the Syrian government forces,\u201d said Mikhail Barabanov, a senior research fellow at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.", "6": "He and others suggested that Russia was providing close air support, including attack helicopters on the battlefield; high-precision strikes with missiles like the short-range Iskander; artillery support; special forces backup; intelligence; targeting; electronic warfare and, as seen recently in Palmyra, mine clearance.", "7": "Although the bulk of the fighter jets flew home to great fanfare, they were replaced by attack helicopters that are less susceptible to the sandstorms that blow this time of year.", "8": "Noting Russian news reports that private security contractors were replacing regular Russian troops in Syria, Aleksandr M. Golts, a veteran Russian military analyst and a visiting researcher at Upsala University in Sweden, speculated that the bulk of the force could become some kind of paramilitary organization not directly linked to the government \u2014 much like what Russia used to fight in southeastern Ukraine.", "9": "Mr. Putin explained initially that the decision to deploy the military in Syria was a fight against terrorism, but the Russian military mostly attacked moderate forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. Palmyra changed that perception somewhat.", "10": "\u201cMoscow can now ask: \u2018We took Palmyra from ISIS, and what have you done?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Barabanov said.", "11": "After the capture of Palmyra, the next target is unclear. Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State, lies 140 miles away, but it is unlikely Russia wants to lead that battle. Aleppo, once Syria\u2019s largest city, is held by a confusing patchwork of forces. Mr. Putin called the situation there \u201ccomplicated.\u201d", "12": "Mr. Putin has told a number of visiting envoys that he meant to send a dual message with his March 14 announcement that Russian forces would begin withdrawing, but could also ramp up again instantly, according to Arab and Western diplomats.", "13": "The first message was to the opposition \u2014 that it would remain in Russia\u2019s cross hairs if it did not contribute to a negotiated settlement. Mr. Putin has also specified that he signaled to Mr. Assad that the Russian commitment was not open-ended.", "14": "One question is whether the intervention has already gone too far and whether Mr. Assad now feels emboldened enough to thwart the efforts that resumed on Friday in Geneva to negotiate a political settlement under the auspices of the United Nations.", "15": "In Russia, events in Syria have been portrayed as a significant political and military victory, with Mr. Putin adroitly reclaiming the old Soviet title of global contender.", "16": "\u201cThe goal since Russia began the operation was just to show that Russia is a great power, that it is again sitting at the Yalta table solving the future of other countries together with America,\u201d said Mr. Golts. \u201cPutin needs Assad as a figure in this chess game. Not as a player in himself, not as an actor, but as a figure.\u201d", "17": "In that vein, Mr. Assad has been lionized in Russian state television reports as a worthy, even noble ally.", "18": "Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the television anchorman who presides over the weekly news show \u201cVesti,\u201d the main Kremlin propaganda vehicle, could barely contain his enthusiasm for the Syrian leader.", "19": "\u201cI should note that Bashar Assad is in a great shape for being 50 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a lean and elegant man. His manner of speaking is emotional and, therefore, infectious. He is courageous. His thoughts are deep and elaborate.\u201d", "20": "As evidence of Mr. Assad\u2019s \u201ccourage\u201d Mr. Kiselyov noted that he did not demand interview questions in advance, a standard practice in Russia. The piece concluded by describing Mr. Assad as \u201ckrepki perets,\u201d old Russian slang for \u201ca tough guy.\u201d", "21": "In discussions, Mr. Putin has made it clear that he will not withdraw his support for the Syrian leader until there is a clear alternative in place. By an alternative, he means a specific figure who the Russian leader can feel confident will control the army and hold together what is left of the existing government, diplomats said.", "22": "Removing Mr. Assad before that \u201cwould lead to the collapse of the secular authoritarian regime in Syria, and, from the Russian point of view, would give power in Syria to ISIS and Al Nusra,\u201d said Mr. Barabanov.", "23": "That does not mean that Russia intervened in Syria for Mr. Assad personally, however, or that it will stick by him.", "24": "Russia faces certain risks either way. Its support for Mr. Assad has strained its ties with Sunni Arab leaders and risks inflaming passions among its own population of 20 million mostly Sunni Muslims.", "25": "Mr. Assad also enjoys strong support from Iran, another longtime patron of Syria\u2019s and Russia\u2019s partner in the battlefield. The Iranians are adamant that Mr. Assad stay, and Russia has been trying to build strong military and trade ties with Iran.", "26": "Gen. Qasem Suleimani, the mysterious general behind Iran\u2019s Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, was reportedly in Moscow for talks on Friday. His last visit preceded Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria, but lately there have been signs of strains. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not meet with the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, on his most recent visit to Tehran.", "27": "If no clear alternative to Mr. Assad emerges, diplomats and analysts expect candidates to emerge in an extended transition period, with Mr. Assad remaining in place, perhaps with diminished powers. That stage could last through the summer of 2017, the United Nations timetable for the completion of a new Constitution and new presidential elections.", "28": "Mr. Assad would almost surely lose such a vote, the Kremlin expects, leading to what would be a dignified exit, diplomats said."}}, {"title": "Egyptians Denounce President Sisi in Biggest Rally in 2 Years", "date": "2016/04/16", "source": "NYT", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/world/middleeast/cairo-protesters-denounce-egyptian-president-sisi.html?ref=todayspaper", "content": {"1": "CAIRO \u2014 More than a thousand people gathered in downtown Cairo on Friday, chanting slogans denouncing President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and protesting his decision to transfer sovereignty of two islands in the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.", "2": "The demonstration was the largest in at least two years in Egypt. And it was the most significant public challenge to Mr. Sisi by antigovernment activists who have been all but forced into the shadows by a state crackdown on dissent.", "3": "By venturing into the streets in defiance of a strictly enforced ban on political protest \u2014 testing the authorities\u2019 often reflexive use of force \u2014 the activists appeared emboldened by recent criticism of Mr. Sisi, including from once resolute government loyalists.", "4": "The downtown protest and a handful of other demonstrations were in response to Mr. Sisi\u2019s decision last week to transfer sovereignty of  Tiran and Sanafir, two uninhabited islands at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea, to Saudi Arabia. The government said it was simply returning to Saudi Arabia territory that had been transferred to Egyptian control in 1950, amid concerns that Israel might seize the islands.", "5": "In an unusual burst of public outrage, Egyptians criticized Mr. Sisi\u2019s decision as an unseemly concession to Saudi Arabia in return for billions of dollars in aid, and an unforgivable wound to national pride. The complaints, online and in the news media, have struck at the heart of Mr. Sisi\u2019s carefully created image as a staunch nationalist defending Egypt against covetous foreign powers, and forced his government to defend its decision.", "6": "In a speech last week, Mr. Sisi insisted that Egypt had not given up a \u201cgrain of sand,\u201d and chastised the public for an apparent lack of faith in the country\u2019s leadership, including the intelligence agencies and the military. \u201cThe army has no patriots, and they are all willing to sell their country?\u201d he asked rhetorically.", "7": "\u201cPlease let us not talk about this matter again,\u201d he added, saying that the Parliament would take up the question of the islands, \u201cand form a committee, or two, and do whatever it wants.\u201d", "8": "Mr. Sisi has also come under attack for his  stewardship of the economy and the handling of an inquiry into the murder of an Italian student, Giulio Regeni, which has caused a diplomatic rift with the Italian government. In his speech, Mr. Sisi said that the \u201cferocity of the attacks reflects on our success.\u201d", "9": "The protests on Friday were smaller than the overwhelming street demonstrations in 2011 that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, and the protests two years later that ushered out his elected successor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Friday\u2019s protests were easily contained by the security services, which detained dozens of people in Cairo, Alexandria and other parts of the country.", "10": "Even so, they appeared to represent a symbolic milestone for government opponents battered over the last few years by increasing repression, who said that the demonstrations reflected their mounting anger.", "11": "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the islands,\u201d said Khaled Dawoud, the spokesman for a coalition of opposition political parties. \u201cIt\u2019s about the overall performance of President Sisi, the way he treats us, the unilateral decisions, the arrests of young men and women.\u201d", "12": "Members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which has faced the brunt of the government crackdown, also marched at some of Friday\u2019s rallies.", "13": "At the demonstration in downtown Cairo \u2014 near the spot where the first protest started against Mr. Mubarak on Jan. 25, 2011 \u2014 the strong turnout signified a breakthrough for activists, said Mr. Dawoud, whose brother was among those detained. Left-leaning activists who formed the majority of the crowd revived chants that are rarely heard in public these days, including \u201cthe people want the fall of the regime.\u201d"}}]
