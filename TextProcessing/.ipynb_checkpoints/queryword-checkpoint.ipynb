       "  'Paragraph for read': \"'Anne of Green Gables' is also a romance, but a slow-burning one. Anne can't stand Gilbert until the final pages of the first novel, her attentions turned less to love than her friendship with Diana. In the middle of the third novel in the series, 'Anne of the Island,' Anne is still putting Gilbert off, rejecting his proposal of marriage. It is not until the beginning of the fifth book, 'Anne's House of Dreams,' by which point Anne has had other suitors and other proposals, that the two are finally married, going on to have seven children. For all her curiosity, imagination and education, Anne eventually arrives at the traditional ending: a husband, a family and all the attendant duties, the nonconforming woman who conforms. But the novels do not present this as either a great tragedy or a great victory. Instead, these choices look a lot like the fraught and difficult compromises of adulthood, in which you might put aside personal desires to care for your mother or modify your career goals to accommodate children. We would flatter ourselves to think that there is anything particularly old-fashioned about Anne's trajectory. She is a thoroughly modern girl.\"},\n",

Such a revival would involve huge shifts in spending priorities, tax hikes on the wealthy and an overhaul of agencies. In other words: It would require an entirely different political and social climate than the one we have. Then again, tackling seemingly intractable problems is what Big Philanthropy is all about. As such, it seems uncharitable to deny Callahan his dreams of a more egalitarian world.\"},\n",
