		"1" : "MY JEWISH YEAR18 Holidays, One Wondering JewBy Abigail Pogrebin326 pp. Fig Tree Books. $22.95.",
		"2" : "According to the writer Leon Wieseltier, the greatest scandal among American Jews is illiteracy. We simply don’t know enough — not nearly enough — about who we are and what Jews believe.",
		"3" : "During lunch at a Washington, D.C., steakhouse more than a decade ago, Wieseltier encouraged my own Torah study and efforts to deepen my faith by admonishing, “Who are we to let this 4,000-year-old tradition slip through our fingers?” The journalist Abigail Pogrebin, who interviewed Wieseltier for her book about Jewish identity, “Stars of David,” takes his cri de coeur seriously. In “My Jewish Year,” she becomes curious about how Jews search for meaning — “something tugged at me, telling me there was more to feel than I’d felt, more to understand than I knew” — and decides to celebrate all the Jewish holidays of the calendar year, even the ones she’s never heard of.",
		"4" : "She calls herself a “wondering” Jew, and her exploration is lively, funny and honest. It is a relatable, immersive experience that pays homage to “The Year of Living Biblically,” by A. J. Jacobs, who writes the foreword. She is a holiday pilgrim uninterested in journeying into Orthodoxy (she attends a Reform synagogue) but intent on reaching others like her, indeed like so many secular American Jews, who “do not connect their Jewish identity to Judaism.”",
		"5" : "Pogrebin lowers her shoulder and goes straight through the Jewish calendar with an emphasis on doing more so that she might feel more. Whether partaking in all-night study before Shavuot (when the Bible says Moses received the Torah at Mount Sinai) or blowing the shofar during Elul, the period of self-reflection and repentance before Rosh Hashana (the Jewish new year), she uncovers the small detail (single malt Scotch is the festive drink of choice for Simchas Torah, when Jews celebrate the annual completion of reading the Torah) and the erotic one: “Sukkot is about shtupping” (Yiddish for both “pushing” and “having sex”), one rabbi tells her, describing the sexual aspect of thrusting the lulav and handling the lemon-like etrogs.",
		"6" : "More substantively, Pogrebin brings both curiosity and candor to her search. During a fast on the first day of January, the 10th of Tevet, marking the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians, she grabs hold of the larger point of skipping a meal: “Our tradition doesn’t care about whether you’re sated, but about what you do.” This is a day of sacrifice to focus the mind on helping others rather than satisfying ourselves. Pogrebin strives valiantly throughout the year, learning (she interviewed more than 60 rabbis and scholars) and breaking stereotypes of our tradition, as when she blesses a woman sitting next to her at a feminist Seder on Passover.",
		"7" : "When she falls short, she levels with the reader. Despite her efforts, after the introspection and repentance of the High Holy Days Pogrebin describes feeling bereft. Like Morales from the musical “A Chorus Line,” who sings about feeling “nothing,” Pogrebin writes: “I didn’t feel changed. There was no revelation.” The admission underscores a truth about deepening one’s faith and observance: It’s hard. This is where “My Jewish Year” occasionally disappoints. Pogrebin and I are both journalists and Jewish seekers who have written about the experience. But what happens after the pilgrimage and the book? The spiritual work is just getting started and is fraught with obstacles. Living up to one’s faith is never easy, and opening your heart to the spiritual touch takes time. Often what you are supposed to feel and supposed to do get in the way. I think changing your life through faith is more like a ladder than a year of forced ritual.",
		"8" : "Indeed, defining ritual observance as adhering to a holiday calendar offers a limited perspective. Ask many in the Orthodox community for whom spiritual boredom is a product of rote observance. To me, the essential question is, Where is God? For Pogrebin, as for many Jews, this is a complicated question — she is a believer, “not in God as all-powerful, but in God as protector and healer.” The question of God is, in my view, one we must spend more time exploring if we are to find meaning and purpose as a community beyond culture and debates over Israel. I prefer going deeper into Jewish liturgy to celebrating the new year for trees.",
		"9" : "Still, this pilgrimage is a serious and important one. Pogrebin writes poignantly of connecting the dots of Jewish identity for her children through a Yom Kippur prayer or a Passover debate she devised about the extent of Pharaoh’s culpability. This is a goal shared by many Jewish parents who want their kids to understand that being Jewish is about more than a gift on Hanukkah or culture alone.",
		"10" : "We also share a love for the Jewish Sabbath — which she calls a time of “deliberate intermission.” Shabbat is for me the most spiritual and peaceful of Jewish holidays, however imperfectly both Pogrebin and I observe it.",
		"11" : "Reflecting on the lessons of her experience, Pogrebin quotes Rabbi Peter Rubinstein: All of us create “something sacred in our lives.” After her Jewish year, Pogrebin may accept or reject aspects of her tradition, but at least she knows more about it. This is what Wieseltier was talking about. He wrote in his book “Kaddish,” “Do not overthrow the customs that have made it all the way to you.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "DIG IF YOU WILL THE PICTUREFunk, Sex, God, and Genius in the Music of PrinceBy Ben Greenman286 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $28.",
		"2" : "It’s hard to think of another subject who would require the caveat that Ben Greenman issues early on in his new book, “Dig if You Will the Picture: Funk, Sex, God, and Genius in the Music of Prince.” We must remember, Greenman writes, that Prince “arrived on the earth via normal channels rather than descending into our realm from the empyrean plane.”",
		"3" : "If he insists.",
		"4" : "But for fans of the musician, his death at 57 in 2016 felt, even more than other departures, like a jarring disruption in the workings of the universe. How could all of that energy and brilliance and eccentricity exist one moment and not the next? Where did it go?",
		"5" : "“Dig if You Will the Picture” isn’t a biography. It isn’t an annotated discography. It isn’t a memoir of fandom. It’s a bit of all these things. To this collage-like task, Greenman, a former editor at The New Yorker and the author of several previous books, brings both broad and specific bona fides.",
		"6" : "Broadly, he’s often written about music, and collaborated on books with Questlove, George Clinton and Brian Wilson. Specifically, he’s a Prince obsessive. He recounts buying the lascivious early records when he was just a kid in Miami. When “The Black Album” was being famously not released in 1987, Greenman, then a college student at Yale, traveled to New York and paid $100 for a poorly made samizdat copy. Most important, he’s clearly listened to every track, from the classics to the swollen output of the aughts, which is more than one might fairly ask even of Prince’s biggest fans.",
		"7" : "Greenman writes in an introduction that his book is not just an “investigation” and “celebration,” but “a frustration as well.” He means the frustration of trying to capture the experience of Prince’s music in words. But it’s also difficult to piece together the details of his life. Prince left home when he was a teenager to live with a friend’s family, but the events and tenor of his early years mostly elude capture. Since his death, more about his adult life has become known, though often through anecdotes so quirky that they sound like urban legends.",
		"8" : "What we do know for sure is that Prince was “gifted, restless, virtuosic, relentless, airborne,” as Greenman puts it, but that he could also be “dropsical,” “fussy” and “incoherent.” There was, first and foremost, the “recurring self-indulgence” (“not an uncommon problem among geniuses”) and lax quality control as time went on. Greenman looks at those flaws with clear eyes, but he’s such an admirer that he can be touchingly over-praiseful as well, particularly when it comes to lyrics. He can make all the comparisons to William Blake he wants (and he does), but many of the lyrics he approvingly quotes just don’t scan. Is “I’ve got to have your face / all up in the place” really a “marvelously compressed” couplet? And if “When two are in love, the falling leaves appear to them like slow-motion rain” is “some of his loveliest natural imagery,” then maybe natural imagery wasn’t his strongest suit.",
		"9" : "Competing for the title of his strongest suit — a ridiculously long list of candidates included guitar playing, singing, dancing, arranging and wearing ruffles — was sex. Even in the wolfish world of popular music, no one had written about the subject “with as much enthusiasm and imagination” as Prince did. “He seems to have been straight,” Greenman writes. Yes, the way Usain Bolt seems to be fast. Robert Christgau ended a brief review of “Dirty Mind” in 1980 like this: “Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home.”",
		"10" : "Prince the raunchy sylph eventually became a Jehovah’s Witness who would bowdlerize his more explicit material in concert. The effect was hardly virginal; now he just seemed like a raunchy sylph winking about it. Even early on, though, he expressed a kind of worship of, if not chasteness, then at least a not-just-bedroom variety of commitment. (“I never wanted to be your weekend lover,” he sings in “Purple Rain.” “I only wanted to be some kind of friend.”) He sold “sex without menace,” Greenman writes, and even his debauched early songs were “innocently filthy, all tugged-at zippers and hastily rearranged sweaters. They could have come from some alternate-universe production of ‘Grease.’”",
		"11" : "Greenman, on Twitter and elsewhere, can be very funny. He can also be punny. His penchant for wordplay sometimes gets the best of him in this book. (“The album was alive on arrival,” he writes of Prince’s self-titled 1979 release.) But he’s focused and convincing where it counts, on the music, as when he writes of “When Doves Cry”: “The horizon line of the song wasn’t straight, and psychological tension was everywhere. There was a kind of astringency in the vocals, a choked-up or choked-off quality; it was a song that said plenty but was still mostly filled with what could not be said.”",
		"12" : "Prince made a dizzying number of aesthetic decisions that the less flighty among his fans would have found unforgivably cheesy in anyone else. Perfectly typical was the list of images he sent to guide the cover-art designer for the album “Around the World in a Day.” They included “a tearful old woman, a clown juggling the earth, and a ladder ascending to heaven.” When he changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol for a time, newspapers were at a loss to reproduce it in print. So Prince mailed out hundreds of floppy disks containing the symbol in “multiple resolutions and variations.” During his contractual struggles with Warner Brothers, he wrote the word “slave” on his face. The reason he could remain so respected and beloved despite all his goofiness and more serious distractions is a pure tautology: because he was Prince.",
		"13" : "The stingy Prince that Greenman recounts in a chapter titled “Call the Law” — the stern copyright enforcer who targeted YouTube clips and other unauthorized uses of his work, to “no real effect other than to alienate fans” — was difficult to square with the performer who gave of himself so generously in concert and could even be self-deprecatingly funny. (In the 2010 song “Laydown,” the diminutive star referred to himself as “the purple Yoda.”) Perhaps his attempts to control the internet were a way of overcompensating for having felt powerless against Warner Brothers.",
		"14" : "Greenman’s book is not a straight path, but it doesn’t aspire to be. It mostly succeeds on its own terms, as an overview of the talent, the excesses, the adoration. But with the loss of Prince still fresh, the compelling question lingers as to whether he can be written about in a way that’s fully and traditionally satisfying; whether anyone — 20, 30 or 40 years from now — will be able to look back and write a life of him that some review might call “magisterial.” Certainly he’s worthy of one. But the mystery of him — the prodigious one given to him seemingly at birth, and the coy one manufactured by him — might be too profound a barrier. For now we have discerning, still-grieving fans like Greenman, shining light where they can."

		"1" : "The Inheritance: Anne Hillerman’s new novel, “Song of the Lion” — about a car bombing at a high school basketball game and the deeper plot behind it — enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. If Hillerman’s name sounds familiar, then so should those of her central characters: Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Sgt. Jim Chee and Police Officer Bernadette Manuelito, all of whom appeared in a popular and long-running detective series by Anne’s father, Tony Hillerman, before his death in 2008. “Song of the Lion” is Anne Hillerman’s third addition to the catalog. “My dad and I never talked about my continuing the series,” Hillerman told me in a recent email. But she and her husband, the photographer Don Strel, did collaborate with him on a nonfiction book (“Tony Hillerman’s Landscape”) that was eventually published in 2009, a year and a day after her father’s death. “Don and I did a book tour and, inevitably, the people in the audience asked if Dad had any novels pending for posthumous release,” she said. “I must have been asked the ‘any more stories coming?’ question a hundred times. When I told them no, I could sense their disappointment. As I healed from the worst of my grief, I realized I desperately missed those stories too.”",
		"2" : "Before she turned to novels, Hillerman worked as a reporter, editor and reviewer of books and restaurants for a Santa Fe newspaper, The New Mexican — where her father, as it happens, was once executive editor — and for a regional edition of The Albuquerque Journal. “I covered lots of different topics,” she said: “the school board, the Santa Fe Opera, the New Mexico Legislature, some police stuff, the fate of teenage runaways and more.” (Suddenly, her novel’s high school sports angle feels foreordained.) “I miss the intensity of journalism and the camaraderie of a busy office,” she said, “but I am relishing this midlife career change.”",
		"3" : "Now Lie in It: For the second week in a row, the top-selling book on the advice list (available online) is Adm. William H. McRaven’s “Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life … and Maybe the World.” A retired member of the Navy SEALs who commanded the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, McRaven originally compiled these tips for the 2014 commencement at the University of Texas, Austin — the “year’s best graduation speech,” according to Inc. magazine. Making your bed, he explained, starts the day with a sense of accomplishment. “And if by chance you have a miserable day,” he added, “you will come home to a bed that is made.”"

		"1" : "It’s impossible to pinpoint the moment you grow up, but I remember a day when I got a taste of what adults had to deal with. And it’s stayed with me ever since.",
		"2" : "I was 13. We lived in Tybjerg in the south of Zeeland, Denmark. Our house was part of what in the early ’70s was to have been a big development in this tiny farming village. Instead, it began and ended with three bungalows.",
		"3" : "Ours was the first of the three. The whole village probably had 40 people living there. There was a church and a school, which also served children from the nearby towns.",
		"4" : "Denmark is a Protestant Christian country. It has a state church. Confirmation is a big deal. It symbolizes the move from child to adult, and is a ritual confirming your baptism. I was the youngest, with two older sisters, and my parents had never gotten round to having me baptized. Church never played a part in our daily lives.",
		"5" : "But I wanted to have my confirmation. So one week before the date, we went up to the church and I was baptized by our local vicar. Confirmation means a big party and an occasion for big presents.",
		"6" : "The presents: That’s what we kids focused on for sure. There is a lot of pressure on parents to deliver. My mum didn’t have much money, but she threw a party for me. It was great. I got gifts from family and friends but my favorite was from my mum. She’d gotten me a Sanyo mini-stereo with speakers that detached. Unbelievably cool.",
		"7" : "My oldest sister had left home by then so I now had the corner room. I’d covered the walls with posters — Duran Duran, Human League, David Bowie. I’d even made a disco light — three colored bulbs in a box that blinked to the rhythm of the music. I could invite a girl over and woo her with my incredible setup. Welcome to the crib. (At this point the closest I’d been to a girl was an embarrassed shuffling of feet at a school dance, but in my mind I was ready.)",
		"8" : "Then one day, an afternoon, there was a knock on the front door. This was a little weird, as our door was always open. We literally didn’t have a key. Anyway, a knock, and then a louder knock. Insistent. I opened the door. Outside two men were waiting.",
		"9" : "One was the county cop, the other from an electronics store. Back then the local cop had many tasks, one of which apparently was to escort local merchants when they had to retrieve goods when the payments had dried up. It turned out my mum hadn’t been able to really afford that mini-stereo and now they had come to take it back.",
		"10" : "I was shocked and horrified, but let the men in. I walked them down to my room and unplugged the Sanyo, reattached the speakers and handed over my prized possession. I remember that it seemed the men couldn’t get out of there quick enough.",
		"11" : "I stared at the empty spot where my stereo had proudly sat just a few moments before. I couldn’t believe it. How could this happen to me? Why me? It didn’t seem fair.",
		"12" : "And then it hit me. The shame. And I felt terrible. Not because I lost a stereo, but because I knew how the repossession would make my mother feel: That she had let me down. And I hated it. Suddenly all my pride disappeared. The stereo didn’t matter. I understood that my mother had felt this stupid pressure to deliver an amazing party, with all the right presents, even though she couldn’t afford it.",
		"13" : "I don’t remember my mother ever telling me she loved me. I also have never doubted for a second that I was loved. Actions speak louder than words and our mum always had our back. Unconditionally.",
		"14" : "When I was younger I was very good at telling my mother why I had to have Adidas Copa Mundial soccer boots with screw-in studs to improve my game, or the right glove if ever I was to become a sports shooting club champion. I was the little brother, the youngest, and spoiled.",
		"15" : "So I found my old cassette player. I put it right in the Sanyo’s place and decided not to care for stuff ever again. (I’ve negotiated an exception with myself for mountain bikes and mountain-bike gear; we agree that’s necessary for all sorts of profound reasons.)",
		"16" : "I have kids of my own now. They are more sensible than I was as a young teenager. I do spoil them, but I try to pass on the lessons from my mum, too, including one they experienced a couple of summers back.",
		"17" : "We have a big family from Denmark, England and Greenland, and every other year we rent a place in the south of Europe and all get together for a week of relaxation. On Day 1 we go shopping for the week. We go in three cars and raid the nearest supermarket. It’s amazing how much food and drink you suddenly can’t live without.",
		"18" : "This specific year we shopped for a feast fit for Caligula. We drove back to the house and unloaded. It was an old Spanish converted mill, and the kitchen had one of those huge tables that could seat 24 people. We filled the table with bags. It was glorious.",
		"19" : "My daughter came to me to say that grandma wasn’t feeling well. I rushed out to the patio where my mum was seated, drinking a glass of water.",
		"20" : "She had to sit down, she said, because she felt sick at the sight of all the bags. “It’s too much, the greed — we don’t need all this,” she said, a little angry with us.",
		"21" : "I think her dislike of consumerism and deep-rooted fear of not being able to afford all we had bought played a part as well. I assured her that food for 24 people for a week takes up a lot of space.",
		"22" : "She calmed down. Later, I relayed the story of the Sanyo to my kids. We all had an amazing week. And when it was over we left quite a bit of stuff behind."

		"1" : "THE GOLDEN PASSPORT Harvard Business School, the Limits of Capitalism, and the Moral Failure of the MBA Elite By Duff McDonald 657 pp. Harper Business/ HarperCollins Publishers. $35.",
		"2" : "When the Harvard Business School was founded in 1908, the first entirely graduate-level professional business program in the country was described by the future Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell as a “great” but “delicate experiment.” Today the school is indisputably great, but hardly delicate. It accepted just 12 percent of nearly 10,000 M.B.A. applicants in 2016. Eighty-nine percent of those who were accepted attended, which means that Harvard remains the overwhelming first choice among graduate schools of business, despite occasional rankings that put Stanford, Yale or Northwestern ahead of it. There are more than 76,000 living Harvard M.B.A. alumni, 33 percent of whom live outside the United States, forming what is very likely the most potent network of any graduate school.",
		"3" : "The marriage of Harvard’s prestige and intellectual pedigree to overtly moneymaking pursuits has yielded an institution that not only teaches the fundamentals of business education but also provides its soon-to-be-wealthy graduates with “unrivaled opportunity,” and has become a “money machine unto itself,” as Duff McDonald puts it in his sweeping survey of the school’s history and influence.",
		"4" : "But how and why that might be the case isn’t really what interests McDonald, the author of previous books about McKinsey, the consulting firm, and JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon. In “The Golden Passport,” he’s determined to call the Harvard Business School to account, citing its founding doctrine, which was to develop “a heightened sense of responsibility among businessmen” (and eventually women) who “will handle their current business problems in socially constructive ways.” In that regard, McDonald is scathing in his critique: Harvard Business School has not only “proven an enormous failure,” but its very success has made it positively “dangerous.”",
		"5" : "He drives home the point in chapter after chapter, picking up steam in more recent decades: Harvard, he maintains, provided the ideological underpinnings for the junk-bond-induced takeover mania and resulting scandals of the 1980s; the corporate scandals of the 2000s; the egregious increase in the pay gap between chief executives and ordinary employees; the real estate mortgage bubble and ensuing financial crisis; even the election of Donald Trump. In McDonald’s view, the school has contributed to pretty much every bad thing that has happened in American business and the economy in the last century. In the wake of whatever scandal or financial collapse or recession to which it has contributed, it wipes its hands, distances itself and still has the nerve to put forth its experts as the solution to problems.",
		"6" : "In virtually every instance, McDonald contends, Harvard has obsessively pursued money, sending a disproportionate number of its graduates to consulting firms beginning in the 1950s (it was all but synonymous with McKinsey), to Wall Street in the 1980s and to entrepreneurial start-ups once initial public offerings became the rage in the 1990s — and provided intellectual justifications for its actions. Much of that wealth found its way back to the school itself. Its professors earn enormous sums as consultants to businesses populated by their former students, who also give generously to their alma mater: Its endowment stood at $3.3 billion by 2015, a dedicated portion of the university’s enormous $32.7 billion.",
		"7" : "McDonald’s criticism of Michael Jensen, now an emeritus professor, is especially withering. As he sees it, Jensen bears major responsibility for the rapacious hostile takeovers and the obsession with stock prices and short-term results that led to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, as well as for the emergence of outlandishly high chief executive pay.",
		"8" : "Jensen came to the business school in 1984, just as the junk-bond-fueled takeover boom was gaining steam, and he became a full-time faculty member in 1989. Undeniably one of the most influential business theorists of modern times, he advocated an “agency” theory of management in which management’s sole duty was to maximize shareholder value. This upended the long-held “stakeholder” model, in which management was seen as having broader obligations to a corporation’s workers, customers and communities.",
		"9" : "Jensen’s theories had simplicity and consistency: If all that matters is shareholder value, then hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and other forms of financial engineering are fine as long as they boost share prices, no matter that battalions of workers have to be fired and community relations damaged. Jensen also championed share-based executive compensation on the grounds that no matter how much executives were paid, shareholders benefited. This was an idea that swept corporate America. McDonald notes that in 1992, the C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 firms made an average of $2.7 million a year. By 2000, the average was $14 million.",
		"10" : "Just about every premise of the “agency” model, McDonald says, has now been punctured, but only long after the damage has been done. An obsession with stock prices and short-term results was the motive for many of the accounting scandals of the 2000s, which were designed to prop up share prices, and as a result, high executive pay. Even Jensen eventually had to concede that the liberal use of stock options as executive compensation had become “managerial heroin.”",
		"11" : "Jensen is just one of many examples of the insidious relationship between Harvard Business School theory and real-world calamities in ”The Golden Passport,” but it seems worth asking: Is McDonald’s broadside fair? Apart from a few brief quotations from his published work, we don’t hear from Jensen himself, or any of the other still-living culprits McDonald identifies. It’s hard to fault McDonald, who reports that Harvard Business School “shut me out entirely” when he sought cooperation, and pretty much shut down everyone who works there. That seems a shame. McDonald insists he isn’t “anti-business-school” (he attended Wharton), nor is he “anti-wealth.” Nonetheless, he says he found the rejection “liberating.”",
		"12" : "But I missed a greater sense of balance. It doesn’t seem fair, to take one major example, to blame Harvard for the recent financial crisis. While their actions remain a subject of spirited debate, the H.B.S. graduates assembled by McDonald — starting with former President George W. Bush, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former S.E.C. Chairman Christopher Cox — are credited by many with mitigating the damage and saving the country from an even worse catastrophe. To take just one counterexample, the young former Goldman Sachs investment banker Fabrice Tourre, one of the few Wall Street figures actually found guilty of civil fraud for his role in the kind of complex mortgage deals that contributed to the crisis, is a graduate of France’s École Centrale and Stanford University. (France’s prestigious “Grandes Écoles” — not H.B.S. — appear to have generated a disproportionate number of the financial engineers who unwittingly helped cause the crisis.) Given the large number of Harvard Business grads in high-ranking executive positions, it’s inevitable that many would be ensnared in what turned into a global catastrophe. It’s a shame that some of them didn’t see the looming disaster and sound an alarm. But hardly anyone did, including graduates of every other business school.",
		"13" : "McDonald bookends his long and impressively researched account with a portrait of Casey Gerald, an African-American who delivered a 2014 Class Day speech that’s been viewed online over 200,000 times, and is featured on the school’s “Making a Difference” website. Gerald turned his back on a lucrative career in private equity to co-found a public interest organization to connect M.B.A. graduates with mission-driven businesses. This may suggest to some that it is hard to generalize about Harvard’s students, though McDonald isn’t stopped: He sees Gerald as one of a handful of “outliers,” the exception that proves the rule that most graduates are morally detached, single-minded fortune seekers.",
		"14" : "I suspect McDonald won’t be invited to campus anytime soon, but perhaps he should be: Agree with him or not, he deserves credit for raising questions that every business school needs to be asking. It’s hard to quarrel with his concluding plea: “H.B.S. should — and can — play a part in helping more people who think about business rediscover a purpose other than profit.” As he puts it: “It needs to graduate more people who are motivated to solve problems, and fewer people who create them.”"

		"1" : "Growing up, Bill Murray and his five brothers (Ed, Brian, John, Joel and Andy) worked as caddies at Indian Hill Country Club in Winnetka, Ill. They gained more from the experience than crumpled cash.",
		"2" : "Ed won a Chick Evans scholarship to Northwestern University. Brian Doyle-Murray drew on his caddying for “Caddyshack,” of which he was a writer. John had a cameo in the film, while Bill starred as the deranged groundskeeper Carl Spackler, forever injecting his goofball, anarchic spirit into a game traditionally associated with corporate strivers and conservative Rotarians. Andy, now a chef, was, like his brothers, inducted into the Caddie Hall of Fame.",
		"3" : "Last fall, the Murray brothers, who host a yearly charity tournament in St. Augustine, Fla., near the World Golf Hall of Fame, deepened their ties with the sport by introducing a golf apparel line. Its name, William Murray Golf, carries a stodgy whiff of Judge Elihu Smails (another character from the movie), though the marketing copy says the clothes are meant to “introduce casual irreverence” to the links.",
		"4" : "You may have seen Bill Murray wearing one of the designs at the World Series last year — a short-sleeve polo with a print featuring tiny highball glasses, some of them tipped over.",
		"5" : "The line, sold in partnership with theChive.com, has recently released its spring collection. Polos in tropical flower patterns and baggy shorts of aqua camo hark back to the 1970s, not only in their loud patterns and colors but also in the combustible material — 92 percent polyester. Not since Jack Nicklaus ambled down the fairway in plaid Sansabelt trousers has golf wear looked this wonderfully gauche.",
		"6" : "Joel Murray, who, in addition to being an actor (he appeared in “Mad Men”), is the chief executive for Murray Brothers Golf, said the clothes are intended to inject liveliness into the sport.",
		"7" : "“You look at the golf world right now, it’s just not that cool,” he said. “I’ve got boys that are 26, 25, and they’re not into golf like we were growing up. They think it takes too long.”",
		"8" : "To design the clothes, the Murray brothers traveled to the Chive offices in Austin, Tex., and shared stories about their days as loopers. The anecdotes are translated by William Murray Golf employees into concepts that the brothers refine — say, switching a print’s miniature golf carts to Eisenhower-era ones.",
		"9" : "Bill came up with the line’s best seller, the shirt with the highball glasses. “He said: ‘What if some of the drinks are spilled? Sometimes drinks spill,’” Joel said. “We try to put a little whimsy and cleverness into it, and Bill is good at that.”",
		"10" : "As Bill revealed in his 1999 book, “Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf,” there are advantages to dressing a little outrageously on the course. In explaining his wardrobe choices when he played the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournament, he wrote: “Today’s palette is central coast chameleon, nothing that would flush the fauna from the flora. Save the fine vines for later in the week, when they can serve to distract the gallery from my golf game.”",
		"11" : "The brothers plan to introduce two collections a year and eventually expand into light jackets, blazers and pants. They are sticklers about the details, Joel said, recalling how shorts were sent back for a redesign after they discovered the pockets were too shallow.",
		"12" : "“Deep pockets, that’s just something you need when you golf,” Joel said. “You want your balls to stay in your pocket — you don’t want things falling out the side.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "If you’ve ever dreamed of renting a villa in Tuscany, hiking under Iceland’s midnight sun or vacationing practically anywhere else in Europe, the time is now. From Reykjavik to Rome, lower airfares and a strong dollar are making for some of the best bargains in years for Americans.",
		"2" : "Round-trip airfares from the U.S. to popular destinations, including Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid and Prague, are down between 20 and 35 percent for travel from April through the start of September, compared with the same time last year, according to Kayak.com.",
		"3" : "The decline is largely because of increased competition from budget carriers. Reykjavik, Iceland, where fares have come down nearly 27 percent, is a good example, said David Solomito, the vice president for North American marketing at Kayak.com. “In the last couple of years, Reykjavik has seen new flights open to several cities, including Boston, Baltimore and Newark, and continues to expand,” he said. “This spring, nonstop routes to Philadelphia will be available.”",
		"4" : "Norwegian began flying to Paris from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Los Angeles and New York last year and plans to begin service in June to Barcelona from Fort Lauderdale; Los Angeles; Newark; and Oakland, Calif. In Reykjavik, the Icelandic low-cost carrier WOW Air has been expanding rapidly, contributing to lower fares. And Zurich-based Edelweiss announced that beginning in June it would be flying nonstop twice a week from San Diego to Zurich, where Kayak noted the biggest drop in fares, down 42 percent.",
		"5" : "At the same time, the strong dollar, which has been hovering at near parity with the euro, means more buying power when you land. “Europe is the bargain of the decade,” said Karen Malone, a travel agent with Travel Leaders in Woodbury, Minn. “I am encouraging all customers who are thinking about Europe or are on the fence to go now.”",
		"6" : "Rental prices are down 10 to 20 percent in Ibiza, Spain; Mykonos, Greece; and Tuscany, Italy, this summer, on Villaway.com, with about 1,000 rentals across Europe. A six-bedroom, six-bath villa with an infinity pool overlooking the Aegean Sea in Mykonos, for example, is listed for $1,509 a night this June, or $246 a night less than last June.",
		"7" : "Last year, Valerie Lederle, an agent at Travel Leaders in Colleyville, Tex., booked a deluxe room with breakfast at the Splendide Royal in Rome for some clients. “They paid 957 euros for two nights,” she said. This year — thanks in part to a deal through her agency —- she said she would be able to book it for her clients for 781 euros, or about $838.",
		"8" : "While Italy and England continue to be top destinations, travel agents say interest is growing in Germany, Ireland, Norway and Portugal, and tour operators are responding. This summer, Globus is offering a new nine-day tour from Dublin to Limerick, Ireland, from $1,709 a person; Cosmos has a new eight-day tour of Andalusia, Spain, from $939 a person; and Monograms has a four-day Lisbon getaway starting at $657 a person.",
		"9" : "Travelers on a budget will find plenty of options in Lisbon and Berlin, said Tom Meyers, the editor of EuroCheapo.com, which reviews inexpensive hotels in dozens of cities. “Lisbon offers sunshine, friendly locals, great food and the chance to stay in four-star hotels for the price you’d pay in a two-star hotel in other European capital cities,” he said. “Meanwhile Berlin has recently experienced a flurry of construction of trendy hotels, nearly all of which offer rooms for under 125 euros a night.” For example, Motel One, a stylish budget chain, just opened a hotel in western Berlin near the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church with rates as low as €83, or $89 a night.",
		"10" : "Copenhagen is also getting new hotels this year, including Hotel Danmark, an 88-room boutique hotel from Brochner Hotels, with a rooftop terrace scheduled to open in May. Rates will begin at 1,250 Danish krone per room per night, or about $180, and will include organic breakfast, high-speed Wi-Fi and a glass of wine or port during a “wine hour.”",
		"11" : "The bargains seem to be outweighing the hesitancy that had grown over vacationing in Europe after a spate of terrorist attacks over the last 16 months, including a deadly one in London last month when a man driving a sport utility vehicle mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, then stabbed and killed a police officer outside Parliament.",
		"12" : "“Decreased demand for certain countries in Europe has meant dramatic growth for others,” said Jean Fawcett, a spokeswoman for Abercrombie & Kent. “Interest in France is slightly lower, but Spain and Portugal are booming, as are Scandinavia and Germany. Turkey is down, but Greece has roared back.”",
		"13" : "The decision by British voters to leave the European Union and the resulting weakened pound have created renewed interest in travel to the United Kingdom, with some travelers taking advantage of the lower rates to splurge. While the pound rose after Prime Minister Theresa May called for a snap election on June 8, the value remains lower than last summer. “A room that cost $750 last year is now approximately $625 for the same room,” said Philip Morris, the corporate director of revenue management at the Dorchester Collection. ”Americans are astounded at the value their money currently has in the U.K.”",
		"14" : "“I have many clients who travel to London and other cities in Europe and this summer they are staying at more luxurious hotels, staying in suites and dining in finer restaurants,” said Eric Hrubant, the president of CIRE Travel, a division of Tzell Travel Group in New York City. He noted that clients who stay at the Savoy Hotel in London every July upgraded from a king room to a suite with a view of the River Thames for $1,991 a night — including a fourth-night-free promotion for booking through Tzell — a saving of $1,554 a night compared with last year’s rates for the suite.",
		"15" : "Travelers looking to upgrade will also find bargains in business class and first-class. La Compagnie, an all-business-class carrier that flies from Newark to Paris, is offering seats for $1,300 round trip this summer. Meridiana, which flies nonstop from New York to Naples and Palermo, Sicily, is offering round-trip flights as low as $575 in coach and $1,550 in business class, with the best deals in April, May and October, said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the travel site JoeSentMe.com, who alerts members to such sales. “Finnair is offering great deals in business class over its Helsinki hub to Russia and other European destinations,” he wrote in a recent newsletter, pointing out that travelers must book 90 days in advance and stay at least 10 days to score the round-trip deals, which range from $2,289 to Moscow to $2,849 to Helsinki from New York.",
		"16" : "But don’t wait too long to make your booking. Some deals, like a flash sale to Iceland with flights as low as $269 from Boston, have already expired. And as summer gets underway, the best bargains will dry up fast."

	"date" : "2017-04-29",
	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/books/review/book-of-joan-of-arc-lidia-yuknavitch.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "THE BOOK OF JOAN By Lidia Yuknavitch 266 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.",
		"2" : "Post-apocalyptic fiction too often pays lip service to serious problems like climate change while allowing the reader to walk away unscathed, cocooned in an ironic escapism and convinced that the impending disaster is remote. Not so with Lidia Yuknavitch’s brilliant and incendiary new novel, which speaks to the reader in raw, boldly honest terms. “The Book of Joan” has the same unflinching quality as earlier works by Josephine Saxton, Doris Lessing, Frank Herbert, Ursula K. Le Guin and J. G. Ballard. Yet it’s also radically new, full of maniacal invention and page-turning momentum.",
		"3" : "The novel opens in 2049, then looks back at a past that is our future. Earth has been devastated by global warming, a crisis exacerbated by incessant warfare over scarce resources. Orbiting the planet is CIEL, a “man-made, free-floating” colony consisting of “redesigned remnants from old space stations” and ruled by the “rage-mouthed Empire Leader” Jean de Men. (Appropriately, his name evokes men and demons alike.) Among other dubious accomplishments, de Men claims the defeat, after a battle at the Alberta Tar Sands, of the “heretic” child-rebel Joan.",
		"4" : "CIEL carries the last remnants of humankind, intent on destroying the Earth below by siphoning off anything of value through “invisible technological umbilical cords” called Skylines. But there are dissenters aboard. One is Trinculo Forsythe, who created CIEL but has undergone years of imprisonment and torture and is now scheduled for execution on trumped-up charges. Another is Trinculo’s partner and the book’s narrator, Christine Pizan, who at 49 is about to age out, a “threat to resources in a finite, closed system.” In protest against de Men and all he represents, Pizan is determined to keep the story of Joan’s heroism alive by burning it into her skin. This is the “Book of Joan” that we are reading. “Once, she had a voice,” Pizan proclaims. “Now her voice is in my body.”",
		"5" : "“Burning is an art,” Pizan explains, neatly linking art and protest, though not without cost: “Burning epidermis gives off a charcoal-like smell.” Her physical pain symbolizes the agony caused by the ecological devastation and loss felt daily in our own time by those who suffer the most extreme effects of displacement and scarcity, of unrestrained capitalism. “Why is it that you, reading this, don’t feel that pain?” is the question implied, again and again, by “The Book of Joan.”",
		"6" : "The sublimely heightened prose in the novel’s opening sections introduces the stark futuristic details of Pizan’s world: “My head is white and waxen. No eyebrows or eyelashes or full lips or anything but jutting bones at the cheeks and shoulders and collarbones and data points, the parts on our bodies where we interact with technology.… My skin is … Siberian. Bleak and stinging.”",
		"7" : "If storytelling is, in Pizan’s hands, a form of resistance, in those of de Men it has become a form of control. Having first found fame as a self-help guru, he now uses propaganda and mythologizing — what Yuknavitch calls “narrative grafts” — to deploy information as a weapon. Like our era’s current tyrants, he’s both terrifying and buffoonish. And if he also calls to mind the pre-Enlightenment world, so too do the novel’s heroic characters, whose names invoke Joan of Arc and the medieval feminist Christine de Pizan. (It’s less clear why Pizan’s partner is called Trinculo. Maybe his parents just liked “The Tempest”?)",
		"8" : "As it unfolds, Joan’s story — including her early life and her discovery of “otherworldly combat techniques” like the temporary raising of the dead — is absorbing. These sections are written in an unadorned prose that nicely contrasts with the intense rhetoric of Pizan’s own narration. Key to Joan’s spiritual perspective is science, with its specialized vocabulary: “Xenotransplantation. … Sometimes Joan would spin around alone in a circle saying the beautiful word out loud to no one but her body, hands clasped over her heart, eyes closed, like praying.” Yet we read such passages in the certain knowledge that it will be Joan’s fate to live on a dying planet.",
		"9" : "Adding yet another layer, “The Book of Joan” pays welcome attention to the surviving flora and fauna of the Earth — focusing in particular on the underground burrows that provide refuge from ecological catastrophe. It is a world the author makes vividly present as Joan hides in caves with ribbon eels below and “long-eared rabbit bats thriving overhead.” Here Yuknavitch skillfully draws on the work of climate-change philosophers like Timothy Morton, on the idea of life at “Earth magnitude,” a scale beyond the human.",
		"10" : "Animals have a direct impact on both Joan’s rebellion and her sense of self. “They made their lives — chose their world order,” we are told of oilbirds, one of the few birds that use echolocation to navigate. “Surely an evolutionary process, but to Joan, it was more an act of perfect imagination. They reminded her of her own warrior-child self.” Creatures like the olms, blind salamanders with electrical receptors “sunk deep into their epidermis,” emerge as a potent tool for the resistance against de Men. Other “wet-wired” organisms, “tens of thousands” of spiders, worms, salamanders and more, have also been deployed to combat the Skylines that threaten to deprive the planet of sustenance.",
		"11" : "Events on Earth and CIEL — in the book of Joan and in the book of Pizan — will eventually converge with a startlingly cathartic sense of both tragedy and hope. Joan must face heart-wrenching truths, while de Men is revealed as even more repugnant than he initially seemed. In scenes reminiscent of Frank Herbert’s “Dune Messiah,” Joan must grapple with her destiny as an “engenderine,” poised between the human and the inanimate.",
		"12" : "Herbert’s hero, as emperor of Dune, was a godlike figure with uncanny abilities who embodied both immense capacity for destruction and a chance for renewal, if only he could overcome the temptations inherent in his powers. Although de Men in some ways exemplifies the same struggle, Joan must confront the implications of her powers as well, a reminder that our ecosystems can suffer even from the acts of those with good intentions. But while Herbert’s writing, especially in the later Dune books, was marked by an airless abstraction, Yuknavitch’s prose is passionate and lyrical, very much in the moment. Fusing grand themes and the visceral details of daily life, she offers a revisionist corrective that shows the influence of writers like Clarice Lispector and Angela Carter. Like Carter, Yuknavitch writes about the body with an easy intimacy.",
		"13" : "From her early experimental novels to her 2011 memoir, “The Chronology of Water,” and her previous novel, “The Small Backs of Children,” published in 2015 and partly set in war-torn Eastern Europe, Yuknavitch has exhibited a rare gift for writing that concedes little in its quest to be authentic, meaningful and relevant. By adding speculative elements to “The Book of Joan,” she reaches new heights with even higher stakes: the death or life of our planet.",
		"14" : "Telling the truth with precision and rage and a visionary’s eye, using both realism and fabulism, is one way to break through the white noise of a consumerist culture that tries to commodify post-apocalyptic fiction, to render it safe. But in Yuknavitch’s work there’s no quick cauterizing of the wound, nothing to allow us to engage in escapism. The result is a rich, heady concoction, rippling with provocative ideas. There is nothing in “The Book of Joan” that is not a great gift to Yuknavitch’s readers, if only they are ready to receive it."

	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/magazine/can-facebook-fix-its-own-worst-bug.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "In early January, I went to see Mark Zuckerberg at MPK20, a concrete-and-steel building on the campus of Facebook’s headquarters, which sits across a desolate highway from the marshy salt flats of Menlo Park, Calif. The Frank Gehry-designed building has a pristine nine-acre rooftop garden, yet much of the interior — a meandering open-plan hallway — appears unfinished. There are exposed air ducts and I-beams scribbled with contractors’ marks. Many of the internal walls are unpainted plywood. The space looks less like the headquarters of one of the world’s wealthiest companies and more like a Chipotle with standing desks. It’s an aesthetic meant to reflect — and perhaps also inspire employee allegiance to — one of Facebook’s founding ideologies: that things are never quite finished, that nothing is permanent, that you should always look for a chance to take an ax to your surroundings.",
		"2" : "The mood in overwhelmingly liberal Silicon Valley at the time, days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, was grim. But Zuckerberg, who had recently returned from his 700-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, is preternaturally unable to look anything other than excited about the future. “Hey, guys!” he beamed, greeting me and Mike Isaac, a Times colleague who covers Facebook. Zuckerberg wore a short-sleeve gray T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, which is his Steve Jobsian daily uniform: Indoor Zuck.",
		"3" : "Zuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. “2016 was an interesting year for us,” he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. “If you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn’t news as part of it,” Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people’s lives. The events of 2016, he said, “set off a number of conversations that we’re still in the middle of.”",
		"4" : "Nearly two billion people use Facebook every month, about 1.2 billion of them daily. The company, which Zuckerberg co-founded in his Harvard dorm room 13 years ago, has become the largest and most influential entity in the news business, commanding an audience greater than that of any American or European television news network, any newspaper or magazine in the Western world and any online news outlet. It is also the most powerful mobilizing force in politics, and it is fast replacing television as the most consequential entertainment medium. Just five years after its initial public offering, Facebook is one of the 10 highest market-capitalized public companies in the world.",
		"5" : "As recently as a year ago, Zuckerberg might have proudly rattled off these facts as a testament to Facebook’s power. But over the course of 2016, Facebook’s gargantuan influence became its biggest liability. During the U.S. election, propagandists — some working for money, others for potentially state-sponsored lulz — used the service to turn fake stories into viral sensations, like the one about Pope Francis’ endorsing Trump (he hadn’t). And fake news was only part of a larger conundrum. With its huge reach, Facebook has begun to act as the great disseminator of the larger cloud of misinformation and half-truths swirling about the rest of media. It sucks up lies from cable news and Twitter, then precisely targets each lie to the partisan bubble most receptive to it.",
		"6" : "After studying how people shared 1.25 million stories during the campaign, a team of researchers at M.I.T. and Harvard implicated Facebook and Twitter in the larger failure of media in 2016. The researchers found that social media created a right-wing echo chamber: a “media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyperpartisan perspective to the world.” The findings partially echoed a long-held worry about social news: that people would use sites like Facebook to cocoon themselves into self-reinforcing bubbles of confirmatory ideas, to the detriment of civility and a shared factual basis from which to make collective, democratic decisions. A week and a half after the election, President Obama bemoaned “an age where there’s so much active misinformation and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.”",
		"7" : "After the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook’s role. “I’m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,” he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people’s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook’s problem to solve?",
		"8" : "It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he’d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing — all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.",
		"9" : "In Silicon Valley, current events tend to fade into the background. The Sept. 11 attacks, the Iraq war, the financial crisis and every recent presidential election occurred, for the tech industry, on some parallel but distant timeline divorced from the everyday business of digitizing the world. Then Donald Trump won. In the 17 years I’ve spent covering Silicon Valley, I’ve never seen anything shake the place like his victory. In the span of a few months, the Valley has been transformed from a politically disengaged company town into a center of anti-Trump resistance and fear. A week after the election, one start-up founder sent me a private message on Twitter: “I think it’s worse than I thought,” he wrote. “Originally I thought 18 months. I’ve cut that in half.” Until what? “Apocalypse. End of the world.”",
		"10" : "Trump’s campaign rhetoric felt particularly personal for an industry with a proud reliance upon immigrants. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s campaign chief executive and now chief White House strategist, once suggested that there were too many South Asian chief executives in tech. More than 15 percent of Facebook’s employees are in the United States on H-1B visas, a program that Trump has pledged to revamp. But the outcome also revealed the depth of the Valley’s disconnection with much of the rest of the country. “I saw an election that was just different from the way I think,” says Joshua Reeves, a Bay Area native who is a co-founder of Gusto, a human-resources software start-up. “I have this engineering brain that wants to go to this analytical, rational, nonemotional way of looking at things, and it was clear in this election that we’re trending in a different direction, toward spirited populism.”",
		"11" : "Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook — and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.",
		"12" : "If it’s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection — information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.",
		"13" : "Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book “Republic.com,” of the urgent risks posed to democracy “by any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.” (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, “True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.”) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: “The Filter Bubble.”",
		"14" : "Facebook says its own researchers have been studying the filter bubble since 2010. In 2015, they published an in-house study, which was criticized by independent researchers, concluding that Facebook’s effect on the diversity of people’s information diet was minimal. News Feed’s personalization algorithm did filter out some opposing views in your feed, the study claimed, but the bigger effect was users’ own choices. When News Feed did show people views contrary to their own, they tended not to click on the stories. For Zuckerberg, the finding let Facebook off the hook. “It’s a good-sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it’s not true,” he said on a call with analysts last summer.",
		"15" : "Employees got the same message. “When Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,” one former executive told me. “I have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we’re going to go focus on.”",
		"16" : "Then, last year, Facebook’s domination of the news became a story itself. In May, Gizmodo reported that some editors who had worked on Facebook’s Trending Topics section had been suppressing conservative points of view. To smooth things over, Zuckerberg convened a meeting of conservative media figures and eventually significantly reduced the role of human editors. Then in September, Facebook deleted a post by a Norwegian writer that included the photojournalist Nick Ut’s iconic photo of a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running in terror after a napalm attack during the Vietnam War, on the grounds that it ran afoul of Facebook’s prohibition of child nudity.",
		"17" : "Facebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. “It’s something I think we’re still figuring out,” he told me in January. “There’s a lot more to do here than what we’ve done. And I think we’re starting to realize this now as well.”",
		"18" : "It struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?",
		"19" : "We met again in the same conference room. Same Zuck outfit, same P.R. executive. But the Zuckerberg who greeted us seemed markedly different. He was less certain in his pronouncements than he had been the month before, more expansive and questioning. Earlier that day, Zuckerberg’s staff had sent me a draft of a 5,700-word manifesto that, I was told, he spent weeks writing. The document, “Building Global Community,” argued that until now, Facebook’s corporate goal had merely been to connect people. But that was just Step 1. According to the manifesto, Facebook’s “next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community — for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all.” If it was a nebulous crusade, it was also vast in its ambition.",
		"20" : "The last manifesto that Zuckerberg wrote was in 2012, as part of Facebook’s application to sell its stock to the public. It explained Facebook’s philosophy — what he called “the hacker way” — and sketched an unorthodox path for the soon-to-be-public company. “Facebook was not originally created to be a company,” he wrote. “It was built to accomplish a social mission: to make the world more open and connected.”",
		"21" : "What’s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more “open and connected” world is by definition a better one. “When I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,” Zuckerberg said now. “The default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.” But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was “actually a real question.”",
		"22" : "Zuckerberg’s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook’s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company’s chief goal — wiring the globe — is controversial. “There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,” Zuckerberg writes, “and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.” He also confesses misgivings about Facebook’s role in the news. “Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,” he writes. “But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.”",
		"23" : "At the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us — about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media — as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president’s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.",
		"24" : "Facebook’s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don’t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in “Building Global Community,” the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public’s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.",
		"25" : "The Facebook app, and consequently News Feed, is run by one of Zuckerberg’s most influential lieutenants, a 34-year-old named Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer. Ten years ago, Cox dropped out of a graduate program in computer science at Stanford to join Facebook. One of his first assignments was on the team that created News Feed. Since then, he has become an envoy to the media industry. Don Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post who was for years a member of Facebook’s board, told me that he felt Cox, among Facebook staff, “was at the 99.9th percentile of interest in news. He thought it was important to society, and he wanted Facebook to get it right.”",
		"26" : "For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, “what you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, ‘Hey, my experience today was meaningful.’ ” Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big “math problem,” incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it “a modern A.I. problem.”",
		"27" : "Last summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed’s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting — people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers — and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of “the hacker way.” In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it’s rolled out to everyone.",
		"28" : "The people who work on News Feed aren’t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people’s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want — what they find “meaningful,” to use Cox and Zuckerberg’s preferred term — and to give them more of that.",
		"29" : "This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what’s best. “One of the things we’ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,” John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. “There are things you don’t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn’t that happen, and what might that mean?” But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users’ actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don’t want these things at all.",
		"30" : "Facebook’s two-year-long battle against “clickbait” is a telling example. Early this decade, the internet’s headline writers discovered the power of stories that trick you into clicking on them, like those that teasingly withhold information from their headlines: “Dustin Hoffman Breaks Down Crying Explaining Something That Every Woman Sadly Already Experienced.” By the fall of 2013, clickbait had overrun News Feed. Upworthy, a progressive activism site co-founded by Pariser, the author of “The Filter Bubble,” that relied heavily on teasing headlines, was attracting 90 million readers a month to its feel-good viral posts.",
		"31" : "If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it’s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook’s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?",
		"32" : "To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid “professional raters” around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (“you’ll never believe,” “this one trick,” etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.",
		"33" : "The more such signals Facebook incorporated into the feed, the more clickbait began to drop out of the feed. Since its 2013 peak, Upworthy’s traffic has declined; it now averages 17.5 million visitors a month. The site has since disavowed clickbait. “We sort of unleashed a monster,” Peter Koechley, Upworthy’s co-founder, told a conference in 2015. “Sorry for that.”",
		"34" : "Cox suggested that it was not exactly correct to say that Facebook, as a company, decided to fight clickbait. What actually happened was that Facebook found better ways to listen to users, who were themselves rejecting clickbait. “That comes out of good-quality panels and measurement systems, rather than an individual decision saying, ‘Hey, I really want us to care about clickbait,’ ” he says.",
		"35" : "This approach — looking for signs of user dissatisfaction — could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.",
		"36" : "But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma — the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated — may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook’s worldview. Facebook’s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people’s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn’t appear that way at first, you’re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn’t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.",
		"37" : "After the election, Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post columnist and a former public editor of The Times, called on Facebook to hire an executive editor who would monitor News Feed with an eye to fact-checking, balance and editorial integrity. Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed, told me that he wanted Facebook to use its data to create a kind of reputational score for online news, as well as explore ways of strengthening reporting through monetary partnerships.",
		"38" : "“At some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, ‘This is good information’ and ‘This is bad information,’ ” says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. “They have to say, ‘These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.’ In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they’re going to have to decide how they’re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.”",
		"39" : "There aren’t many technical reasons Facebook could not implement such plans. The hurdles are institutional and philosophical, and ultimately financial too. Late last year, Facebook outlined a modest effort to curb misinformation. News Feed would now carry warning labels: If a friend shares a viral story that has been flagged and shot down by one of Facebook’s fact-checking partners (including Snopes and PolitiFact), you’ll be cautioned that the piece has been “disputed.” But even that slight change has been met with fury on the right, with Breitbart and The Daily Caller fuming that Facebook had teamed up with liberal hacks motivated by partisanship. If Facebook were to take more significant action, like hiring human editors, creating a reputational system or paying journalists, the company would instantly become something it has long resisted: a media company rather than a neutral tech platform.",
		"40" : "In many ways, the worry over how Facebook changes the news is really a manifestation of a grander problem with News Feed, which is simply dominance itself. News Feed’s aggressive personalization wouldn’t be much of an issue if it weren’t crowding out every other source. “To some degree I feel like the Pottery Barn Rule applies,” says Pariser, the Upworthy chief executive. “They play a critical role in our information circulatory system, and so — lucky them — all of the problems therein are significantly on their shoulders.”",
		"41" : "During our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: “When you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, ‘I run Facebook, I can solve that?’ ”",
		"42" : "“Um,” he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. “Not usually.” He argued that some of Facebook’s critics’ proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook’s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. “It really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,” he said. “There’s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don’t really think that’s right over the long term.”",
		"43" : "Yet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg’s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote “news literacy” among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg’s tone toward critics of Facebook’s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. “I think it’s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,” he said. “I also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.”",
		"44" : "Still, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. “There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” he said. “Having more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.” By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook’s system for letting people tell their friends that they’ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.",
		"45" : "“We’re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don’t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,” Zuckerberg told me. What’s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.",
		"46" : "This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook — and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself — as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.",
		"47" : "Yet Zuckerberg is often blasé about the messiness of the transition between the world we’re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new “social infrastructure” usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.",
		"48" : "A few months after I spoke with Zuckerberg, Facebook held its annual developer conference in San Jose, Calif. At last year’s show, Zuckerberg introduced an expanded version of Facebook’s live streaming service which had been promised to revolutionize how we communicate. In the year since, Live had generated iconic scenes of protest, but it was also used to broadcast a terrorist attack in Munich and at least one suicide. Hours before Zuckerberg’s appearance at the conference, police announced that a Cleveland man who had killed a stranger and posted a video on Facebook had shot himself after a manhunt.",
		"49" : "But as he took the stage in San Jose, Zuckerberg was ebullient. He started with a few dad jokes and threatened to read his long manifesto on stage. For a brief moment, there was a shift in tone: Statesman Zuck. “In all seriousness, this is an important time to work on building community,” he said. He offered Facebook’s condolences to the victim in Cleveland; the incident, he said, reminded Facebook that “we have a lot more to do.”",
		"50" : "Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook’s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is “augmented reality.” The name bursts with dystopian possibilities — fake news on video rather than just text — but Zuckerberg never mentioned them. The statesman had left the stage; before us stood an engineer."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "In the early 1990s, Bill Bradley, the New Jersey senator and former New York Knick, argued several times in front of Congress that legalizing sports betting would dehumanize athletes and lead to the rampant corruption of children. This was no cynical political crusade; Bradley was a true believer. He liked to declare that athletes were not “roulette chips” and tell the story of a game he once played in Madison Square Garden. His Knicks were up by 5 at the end when the other team hit a meaningless basket to cut the final lead to 3. A confused Bradley heard cheers in the crowd, and when someone told him why — the opponent had just lost by fewer points and beat the spread predicted by oddsmakers — his eyes were opened to the sordid callousness of the gambling world. Bradley helped push through the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992, all but banning sports betting outside Nevada and driving a growing industry that employed hundreds underground.",
		"2" : "As it turned out, the country’s millions of sports gamblers didn’t share Bradley’s concern for the sanctity of athletes like Bill Bradley or the children who might grow up to be just like him. In practical terms, the Sports Protection Act has mostly failed, and gambling has effectively grown to be an inescapable part of big-time sports. Nobody knows how many Americans bet illegally on sports, but the American Gaming Association estimates that roughly $150 billion is wagered annually. (By contrast, $4.5 billion was bet in Nevada sports books last year.) A gambler with a hunch about, say, a Golden State Warriors playoff game this month can use a debit card on any one of dozens of offshore online betting sites. If the gut feeling runs a bit more toward whether a specific player can handle the big stage, he or she can pick him in a daily-fantasy lineup and enter a contest to win thousands.",
		"3" : "Sometime in the next four months, the Supreme Court is likely to decide whether to hear an appeal by Gov. Chris Christie and the State of New Jersey that would essentially let states determine whether to allow sports betting within their borders. What the court will do is not certain: The debate is largely being framed in the language of states’ rights versus intrusive and economically harmful federal overreach, and the position the Justice Department will take in any opinion it files is unclear. But most in the gambling industry believe that some court case either now or in the near future — seven other states have recently expressed interest in the added tax, infrastructure and tourism revenue that would come from legalized gambling — will succeed in repealing or gutting the Sports Protection Act.",
		"4" : "Even the professional leagues, which for years mostly opposed legalization on the grounds that expanded gambling would corrupt their product, have started to prepare for changes. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., has publicly come out in favor of regulated sports betting. Last month, the N.F.L. announced that the Oakland Raiders would be moving to Las Vegas, putting an N.F.L. team in the heart of the gambling industry. “There’s an irreversible momentum for sports gambling,” Daniel Wallach, a gambling expert at the law firm Becker & Poliakoff, told me. The rise of daily-fantasy sports (whose legality is accepted by many states) and the placement of N.H.L. and N.F.L. franchises in Las Vegas have diluted the spirit of the law and spawned challenges in court. “We could be looking at legal sports betting in this country in three years,” Wallach said. “We’ve reached the point of no return.”",
		"5" : "Legal gambling on sports doesn’t necessarily mean we will soon follow the example of European and Asian soccer teams that put the logos of online betting sites on the front of their jerseys. There’s still a sizable public-relations gap to overcome — nobody really likes sports bettors. It’s why the charming gamblers in movies tend to be cardsharps or pool hustlers and rarely sports bettors. In cards and pool and games of chance, the people who get hurt are the house or the sucker who willingly took on the hustler. In sports betting, everyone’s a victim: the teammates, the fans, the innocent spirit of American youth. The potential ruin doesn’t stop with the gambler but with the corruption of the sport itself.",
		"6" : "This, of course, is a dubious fear — those who gamble away their savings at the craps table are no different morally speaking from those who blow their money betting on the Cavaliers. And if it sometimes seems as if betting scandals are routine in Europe and Asia — allegations of match-fixing in the lower circuits of professional tennis have circulated for years, for example, as have claims of Asian gambling moguls fixing prominent European soccer matches — the legality of sports betting in a particular country hardly matters when the sharp behind an illicit operation lives in Malaysia and bets millions in a casino in Macau. Regulated sports gambling in New Jersey is unlikely to lead to a new generation of high-powered match fixers in the United States.",
		"7" : "The larger fantasy-sports industry, however, offers both a model and a cautionary tale for how sports betting could grow once it moves into the light of day. For both fantasy sports and gambling, a vast market has emerged for any bit of information that might provide an edge, and its reach has been evident for years, since N.F.L. broadcasts introduced fantasy stock tickers and pregame segments full of references to obscure metrics like “yards after catch” and “defense-adjusted value over average.” Over the past 20 or so years, the world of fantasy sports has broadened its originally stultifying conversations — arguments over how many yards the running back Tiki Barber would gain against the Cowboys’ defense — into inquiries about how games are actually won on the field, whether by examining the way a baseball catcher frames pitches or by establishing the most efficient spots to shoot from on a basketball court. Fantasy talk evolved into real insight.",
		"8" : "If gambling wants to shake off its bad associations, fueled in no small part by the scammers who offer their stone-cold lock of the week for a one-time payment of just $49.99, it will need to share all the data that goes into making an informed sports bet. “There’s nobody in this country who knows more about predictive analytics than the guys working in sports betting,” Brian Musburger, the founder of the new media venture Vegas Stats & Information Network, told me. For years, Brian’s uncle, Brent, the longtime CBS sportscaster, always tried to wink at the gamblers watching his games. If a seemingly meaningless field goal covered the spread, Brent found a way to work in a reference to the people who had just sighed in great, full-bodied relief. Brent left ESPN and joined his nephew’s start-up this year.",
		"9" : "The Vegas Stats network, which debuted in February, still does not have many viewers (if you type VSIN into Google, search results for “vain” still pop up), but if it succeeds, there may be an unexpected benefit to traditionalists like Bradley who want sports to be about wins and losses, free from financial concerns or selfish individual accomplishments. Fantasy might have inspired smarter ways to look at actual game play, but it has also tended to make the experience of watching sports, whether with friends or at a bar, downright unbearable.",
		"10" : "We’ve long since normalized the horror of listening to someone telling you about the tragedy that befell a fantasy team, but if that talk were instead about whether the Cowboys were going to cover the spread, wouldn’t that conversation come closer to the actual, idealized point of the game? There are hundreds of reasons that a team might win a football game by, say, 10 or more points. Each one requires you to consider offenses, defensive schemes or, at the very worst, minor details like the rumors about the quarterback’s recent trip to Cabo San Lucas or what your equipment-manager cousin told you about the impact of last night’s rain on turf conditions — and every such discussion beats talking about your fantasy squad. If Bradley wanted fans to root based on the play of their favorite team, he banned the wrong pastime."

		"2" : "So what is the effect of a question without a question mark? Consider, for instance, the jarringly flat statement, “Where are you going.” The voice, ominously, fails to rise. Curiosity has been replaced by something else: terror, accusation, exhaustion. It’s the kind of thing you might hear at 2 a.m. in a dark room as you try to sneak out the front door. No answer is expected. No answer will satisfy.",
		"3" : "John Edgar Wideman’s “Writing to Save a Life” is full of such questions. “Do extreme circumstances mitigate lies.” “Do pigs stink to cows. Cows to pigs.” The book is an attempt to solve a historical mystery: Why was Louis Till, the father of Emmett Till, court-martialed and hanged in Italy by the United States Army in 1945? Did he really commit the crimes he was accused of? What else might have happened? How deep do the layers of American injustice run?",
		"4" : "Wideman does not really believe in easy answers. On top of which, the historical record keeps leading him, again and again, into dark and silent alleys. So he frames his questions without question marks. “Why would anyone reading the tale today challenge its impartiality.” “Do they live on another planet inhabiting the planet I inhabit.” “Will a moment finally emerge in which a collection of lies offers access to truth.” Some questions have no answers.

		"1" : "The Border Patrol agent watched our Prius approach, then signaled for us to stop. Behind him stood several others in green uniforms, hands resting on holsters, eyes hidden behind sunglasses. German shepherds panted in the heat. “Are you all U.S. citizens?” the agent asked, leaning against the driver’s-side window and glancing around our car. “Yes,” said one of my companions, an artist from Iowa. “Yes,” echoed the other, a poet from Connecticut. Then it was my turn. “Yes,” I said. The agent’s gaze lingered on me for a moment. Then he stood up and waved us through the border.",
		"2" : "Except this was not a border: This was the middle of Interstate 10 between El Paso and Marfa, Tex. No matter. At the Sierra Blanca checkpoint, agents can make arrests for drugs or weapons, share information with federal agencies and turn undocumented immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There are many such checkpoints scattered throughout the continental United States — borders within borders.",
		"3" : "Borders mark the contours of nations, states, even cities, defining them by separating them from all others. A border can be natural — an ocean, a river, a chain of mountains — or it can be artificial, splitting a homogeneous landscape into two. Often it is highly literal, announcing itself in the shape of a concrete wall, a sand berm, a tall fence topped with barbed wire. But whatever form it takes, a border always conveys meaning. Hours before my encounter with the Border Patrol, as the airplane I was on began its descent, I saw from my window seat the wall that separates El Paso from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. On one side were gleaming towers, giant freeways and sprawling parks; on the other, homes huddling together in the afternoon light, winding streets and patches of dry grass. Here you will find safety and prosperity, the wall seemed to say, but over there lie danger and poverty. It’s a message that ignores the cities’ joint history, language and cultures. But it is simple — one might say simplistic — and that is what gives it power.",
		"4" : "For much of the United States’ history, national frontiers were fluid, expanding through territorial conquest and purchases. But at the start of the 20th century, as Arizona and New Mexico approached statehood and the country’s continental borders became stable, so did the desire to secure them and police them — first through congressional acts that prohibited immigration from certain countries and later through the building of fences and walls. During his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump often promised to extend a wall along the Southern border and have Mexico pay for it. At his rallies, this promise was met with cheers and chants of “Build that wall!” When Vicente Fox, a former president of Mexico, declared that his nation had no intention of paying for any such wall, Trump’s response was, “The wall just got 10 feet higher.” The more it was challenged, the higher it became, as if literalizing the border could make all debate about it disappear.",
		"5" : "Whether the administration can find the money to construct an immense border wall remains to be seen. In the meantime, the legal apparatus around it is already being built. This month, speaking to Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales, Ariz., Attorney General Jeff Sessions promised them “more tools in your fight against criminal aliens” — including charging immigrants who repeatedly cross into the United States illegally with felonies and, when possible, with document fraud and aggravated identity theft, which can carry mandatory prison time. His language was the language of war: Nogales, Sessions said, was “ground zero” in the fight to secure the border, a place where “ranchers work each day to make an honest living” while under threat from “criminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into war zones, that rape and kill innocent civilians.” Under the new administration, he said, his Justice Department was prepared for the fight: “It is here, on this sliver of land, on this border, where we first take our stand.”",
		"6" : "In this kind of rhetoric, the border separates not just nationals from foreigners, rich from poor and north from south, but also order from chaos, civilization from barbarians, decent people from criminals. Location becomes character, with everything that designation entails. A person is either American and an honest worker, or she is not American and is a criminal alien. The two categories are seen as inherent and inflexible.",
		"7" : "In January, Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, even if they were green-card holders or refugees who had already been cleared for resettlement. But as reports emerged of families separated by the order, passengers stranded thousands of miles from home, even an infant being denied scheduled surgery, the full effect of this virtual wall revealed itself. By the time the ban was lifted by federal courts, the experience had already brought to the national consciousness a renewed awareness of what happens at the border. In this in-between space, rights we take for granted disappear. At points of entry to the United States, nobody — not even American citizens or permanent residents — is fully protected by the Fourth Amendment, which safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures. Customs and Border Protection officers can search luggage as well as phones, tablets and laptops. Occasionally they ask for online browsing histories and passwords to social-media accounts. A poorly phrased joke on Twitter, a compromising picture on a private Instagram account, a Facebook argument with a crazy uncle — all these could be readable by C.B.P. officers, entirely at their discretion. Again, the border sends a message: Watch what you say.",
		"8" : "The border’s messages always carry with them hints of violence. In the 19th century, the American frontier was a place of conquest, a place where laws did not apply and deadly clashes could happen at any moment. That aura of risk and brutality still hangs over airports, the closest thing we have to frontier outposts and the gateways to cross-border travel. When travelers step into the secure area of an airport, they leave behind bottles of water, take off their shoes and expose their bodies to X-rays, all for the sake of protecting themselves from the potential violence of terrorists. But this system can perpetrate violence by itself. This month, a ticketed passenger who refused to give up his seat on a United Airlines flight from O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was brutally dragged away by the police. David Dao’s injuries, according to his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, include a concussion, a broken nose, two lost teeth and sinus damage that could require surgery. Demetrio went on to ask, “Are we going to just continue to be treated like cattle?”",
		"9" : "This dehumanization is a common feature of the border. Some years ago, returning home from a holiday in Morocco, my husband and I passed through immigration at Kennedy Airport. The border agent glanced at my passport, which lists Morocco as my place of birth. Then she looked at my husband’s and, with a chuckle, asked him how many camels he had traded for me. Even in my shock, I understood that what the agent was trying to assert was her own authority, her superiority over me. If I had dared to challenge her, I might have ended up subject to a secondary search and further questioning. My silence was the price that the border demanded.",
		"10" : "Border walls are literal expressions of our worst fears. Terrorists, rapists, drug dealers and various “bad hombres” are all said to come from somewhere else; drawing lines, we are told, will keep us safe from them. But the lines keep multiplying. What formally counts as the border, according to the United States government, is not just the lines separating the United States from Canada and Mexico, but any American territory within 100 miles of the country’s perimeter, whether along land borders, ocean coasts or Great Lakes shores. That 100-mile strip of land encompasses almost entirely the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont — along with the most populated parts of many others, including California and Illinois. In total, the 100-mile-wide border zone is home to two-thirds of the nation’s population.",
		"11" : "This is such a staggering fact that it bears repeating: The vast majority of Americans, roughly 200 million, are effectively living in the border zone. Any of these people could one day face checkpoints like the one I went through in Sierra Blanca, Tex. They can be asked about their citizenship and, if they fail to persuade the agent — because of how they look, act or sound — they can be detained. The Justice Department established these regulations in 1953 and, though they periodically attract attention, they have never been changed. As we move to erect and enforce more borders, this is another message worth apprehending: Borders do not simply keep others out. They also wall us in."

		"1" : "The longest elevated pedestrian bridge in the world, Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, rises 212 feet above the river and is easily reached by a glass enclosed, 21-story waterfront elevator in Poughkeepsie. On any given day — barring high winds, thunderstorms and lightning — power-walkers, dog-walkers, bicyclists, runners, parents pushing strollers, couples holding hands and people with limited mobility navigate the flat mile and a quarter crossing.",
		"2" : "Below are barges, boats and rowers plying the mighty Hudson. Above are open horizons as well as the occasional falcon, eagle and cormorant. It’s a pastoral Thomas Cole-style landscape come to life. There is often a cool, hang-onto-your-hat breeze and virtually no traffic noise from the Mid-Hudson Bridge, which is within sight.",
		"3" : "For hardier walkers, on the opposite shore is Franny Reese State Park, with almost three miles of hiking trails, in Highland, N.Y. Those with more modest ambitions can aim for the flagpole mounted midpoint over the river.",
		"4" : "“Spring is really amazing because it’s a vivid, lime-green canopy on both sides, apple trees, dogwoods and magnolias in bloom,” said Elizabeth Waldstein-Hart, the executive director of Walkway Over the Hudson, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and enhancing the park and surrounding trail systems.",
		"5" : "This country cousin to the High Line in Manhattan was originally completed in 1888 as a double-track cantilever railroad bridge, a technological marvel at the time. But as the trucking industry accelerated, commercial railroads declined. So did the bridge. A catastrophic fire in 1974 ended its reign.",
		"6" : "For decades, the iron and steel behemoth was a charred eyesore, its nonworking lights and falling timbers a menace. Calls to dismantle it were quelled when an environmental study estimated a price tag of $54 million to do so, Ms. Waldstein-Hart said.",
		"7" : "“The cost to safely remove it was staggering, more than the cost to repurpose it into a pedestrian bridge,” she said. “This huge iron structure could not just fall into the river.”",
		"8" : "In 1992, a groundswell had formed to restore the bridge for car-free use. A combination of public and private funding totaling $38 million paid for the paved 24-foot wide walkway that opened in 2009. The elevator opened in 2014 and is a 10-minute walk from the Poughkeepsie train station.",
		"9" : "Another route to the walkway is through downtown Poughkeepsie, a riverfront city whose Victorian houses and Main Street facades with ornate cornices speak of its prosperous past as a manufacturing center. Empty storefronts illustrate its current economic struggles, though there is a fair amount of construction to arouse optimism. The walkway and beautified waterfront are seen as catalysts for change.",
		"10" : "A highlight of going into town is Mill House Brewing Company, at 289 Mill Street, open daily except Tuesday. The rustic, sprawling space specializes in local spirits and brawny bar food such as fried pickle chips, ale-battered cod and chips, sensational burgers and house-made sausages. Its outstanding 14 craft beers can be sampled through flights of five for $15. Knowledgeable bartenders are silver-tongued when describing nuances of grapefruit, hops, malt, resin and vanilla.",
		"11" : "Those with cars may park in a lot near the bridge entrance ($5 for four hours) and expand this Hudson Valley excursion to nearby Hyde Park, where they will find the Culinary Institute of America, the Vanderbilt Mansion and Springwood, which includes the estate and presidential library of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Otherwise, the majestic walkway and poking around Poughkeepsie are plenty for a day."

		"1" : "Tear yourself away from the picture-postcard Pacific views on Route 1, south of the border between California and Mexico, and you see Valle de Guadalupe undulating to the east, its Mars-like boulders and vast stretches of rose-gold-colored dirt belying the fact that there is some pretty great wine being grown here.",
		"2" : "Valle is not a new wine region — some vineyards date from the 1920s — but this Mexican wine country is calling to millennials, with modern, design-y wineries and grit that can’t be found in Napa or Sonoma. It’s also cheaper than those areas, and less likely to be trodden by tour bus crowds — more “Choose Your Own Adventure” than Club Med. The valley is also relatively easy to reach, and services have cropped up to let visitors imbibe while someone else takes the wheel. Club Tengo Hambre and Turista Libre offer guided food and wine tours; Uber Valle allows Uber users to hail a wine country chauffeur for a day.",
		"3" : "S.U.V.s line the parking lot of Lomita, a funky winery with murals by the Mexico City artist Jorge Tellaeche and offbeat knickknacks like an orange chandelier. With his trucker hat, the proprietor Fernando Pérez Castro, 39, fits right in with his trendy, tattooed clientele. The property started as a retirement home for his parents; he opened the winery in 2009, in love with a woman (now his wife) who lived nearby and wanting a reason to linger.",
		"4" : "“Ten years ago, there weren’t any roads,” he said. “I thought, ‘How do I make a place where I will hang out, where I will feel good, where people will think the way I think?’ What happened was a lot of people my age came here. It wasn’t like I did focus groups.” Lights in the barrel room glow neon red; the restaurant out back serves fish tacos in the shade. There is a white wine whose name translates to a Taylor Swift song (Espacio en Blanco, or “Blank Space”).",
		"5" : "One of the most endearing things about this wine country is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. “This is the junk that didn’t work out,” joked Phil Gregory, an owner of Vena Cava, as he poured flutes of cantaloupe-hued sparkling wine. Next to him, a group of women on a yoga retreat threw back their glasses.",
		"6" : "“What used to happen in this part of the world was that no one had anything to do and now everyone has appointments every hour,” Mr. Gregory said. A native of Manchester, England, who owned a recording studio in Los Angeles, he and his wife, Eileen, first came to Valle de Guadalupe to try the restaurant Laja. Four weeks later, they bought a hillside property that is now home to a winery, bed-and-breakfast and Corazón de Tierra, whose tasting menu of farm-to-table Mexican fare clocks in at under $50 per person. Tables book up fast.",
		"7" : "Not all of the area’s culinary delights demand reservations. Next to Lomita, La Cocina de Doña Esthela serves hangover-curing heaps of diner food like machaca con huevo (eggs scrambled with beef, onions and green peppers), chilaquiles and lamb tacos. Most entrees are under 100 pesos (about $5), and the cinnamon-infused coffee, served steaming in ceramic mugs, tastes like magic.",
		"8" : "Food trucks are a thing here. The one parked at Adobe Guadalupe, a hacienda-style winery that rears horses as well as grapes, actually takes reservations because the ceviche, duck tortas and marinated mushrooms trounce the reputation of things cooked on four wheels. The eating experience is also upgraded: Instead of a curb to perch on, there are a dozen tables on the picturesque patio surrounding the truck.",
		"9" : "Scrappiness pervades the valley. “It used to have a very stinky, particular smell; the wine was very bad,” said Hans Backhoff, founder of Monte Xanic, a large, polished winery that opened in 1988. “That was part of the challenge.” Now, each year brings more visitors than the last, many of whom used to associate Mexico only with beaches and umbrella drinks. “It’s been a continuous fight against ignorance,” Mr. Backhoff said.",
		"10" : "Night life in the valley consists of gazing at the riot of stars in the sky, made visible because of the lack of streetlights and skyscrapers. Encuentro Guadalupe, a collection of modernist cube-shape hotel suites built into boulders, offers dozens of viewing perches, some with telescopes. Though its accommodations are costly — around $500 per night depending on room size — the hotel, like the rest of the region, knows how to appeal to pop-culture-savvy travelers. Shortly after Encuentro opened in 2012, a celebrity and her entourage booked the property for a birthday party. During a tour, a hotel staff member dropped her name with all the weight of a boulder: “Do you know Rihanna?”"

		"1" : "As we drove along the heavily pocked dirt road, bouncing our way through near-total darkness, with no signs to indicate the proximity to our destination — with no signs of any sort — the whites of my girlfriend’s eyes were plainly visible in the night as she murmured, “I’m not so sure about this.”",
		"2" : "Perhaps, it now occurred to me, I had not thought all of this completely through. Here we were, deep in rural western Mexico, about 50 miles from the Pacific, rattling down a profoundly vacant road in an unmarked taxi bound for a restaurant recommended to me by a stranger. Kirsten’s dubiousness was understandable. But more than that, it was no trifling matter, given that I intended to propose marriage to her the following night, at a different restaurant at the end of another endless dirt road.",
		"3" : "I sputtered out my assurances. Appearances to the contrary, I told her, tourists came here to the Guadalupe Valley all the time. The restaurant, Finca Altozano, had been given high marks on various websites. The driver, whom our innkeeper identified as Eduardo, appeared to know where he was going and seemed too courtly to have foul play on his mind. Kirsten seemed to be listening only to her heartbeat.",
		"4" : "The restaurant’s parking lot was itself made of dirt. But it was packed with cars, and when we stepped into the buzzing and low-lit veranda perched high over the valley, I felt all residue of self-doubt transmute into shimmering bravado. Finca Altozano seemed instantly familiar only because it’s the kind of casually evocative country establishment that so many American restaurateurs spend millions on to get wrong.",
		"5" : "Seated near the rotisserie, we ordered grilled octopus, grilled chorizo, tacos with grilled beef — grilled everything, and nothing disappointed, least of all the bottle of white blended grapes that was produced by a winemaker down the way named Amado Garza. It was apple-crisp and surging with minerality. Those flavors originated from the same brawny terrain that had delivered us here.",
		"6" : "As a native Texan, I have visited Mexico many times, and, even more frequently, Alta California, all the way down to the border where San Diego County gives way to Tijuana. But my only excursion into Baja had been many years ago, to its baja-most tip, the uproarious beach-and-nightclub resort city Cabo San Lucas, an episode in my earlier life of Hombres Behaving Badly of which, thankfully, there is no known documentation.",
		"7" : "The thousand-mile fishhook-shape stretch of land extending from Cabo up to Tijuana, and separating the Gulf of California from the Pacific, always struck me as a geographic anomaly of unknown utility, belonging to neither country, and in no particular way announcing itself as worthy of exploration. But then last March I happened to be on assignment in Mexico City, where I met various sources at restaurants of their choosing. It’s no surprise that there is outstanding food in Mexico’s capital city. What stunned me was the quality of the wines. White and red, across the varietal spectrum from viognier to Sangiovese — each was bristling with territorial expressiveness, and completely affordable. The best were unambiguously world-class. And all of them hailed from something called the Valle de Guadalupe, in the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California.",
		"8" : "I had encountered other barely discovered wine sanctuaries while traveling in Croatia, Hungary, Israel, Slovenia and Turkey. Could it be that Mexico, the land of cerveza and tequila, surpassed all of them?",
		"9" : "A week after voters in the United States elected a man who had vowed to erect a wall on America’s southern border, I drove across it with San Diego in my rearview. There are three crossings from San Diego County: Tijuana, Tecate and the one I randomly chose, Otay Mesa. It’s worth noting that the breezy, 90-mile journey from San Diego International Airport to most Valle de Guadalupe attractions along the main expressways (Routes 1 and 3) can be a great deal more plodding in the opposite direction. Driving back into the United States can, depending on day and time, involve anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours in the checkpoint line. To help with planning, a Border Wait Time app is available.",
		"10" : "Whatever qualms you may have brought with you about driving to Mexico are likely to fall away once you take leave of the mangy border townscape of Otay Mesa and the slender, well-tended expressway plunges you into a bronze desert spiked with granite protrusions. The stern beauty of this backcountry will seem familiar to visitors of southern Arizona or the Big Bend country of southwest Texas. What it does not in any way call to mind are the Cancuns and Cozumels that constitute a vacuum-packaged offering of Mexico.",
		"11" : "About two hours south of the San Diego airport, I arrived at the five-year-old resort known as Encuentro Guadalupe, which, from the approach, appears to be a space colony of metallic abodes jutting from a lunar mountain. A dirt road, my first of what would be many, led uphill to the reception area. From here my room was accessible farther up the mountain by means of a dusty hotel van.",
		"12" : "I was in no hurry for this. Instead, I spent the next hour on the open-air bar terrace hanging over the valley, eating a delicious avocado and tuna ceviche while relishing the view and the keen desert air with other tourists, most of them Mexican.",
		"13" : "Eventually I hailed the driver and we trundled up to my “king eco-loft,” which Encuentro Guadalupe in its promotional materials characterizes as “luxury camping.” The “luxury” part was right: My quarters, including breakfast, cost over $300, considerably more than I had expected to pay. The room was narrow and austere: a king-size bed with a white bedspread, white steel walls, a small bathroom and windows that faced the desert mountains. Upon closing the heavy metal door and drawing the curtains, I experienced the sensation of being in a clean, low-lit refrigerator.",
		"14" : "As soon as I could, I retreated to the resort’s infinity pool, with its spectacular view of the desert crags. The Jacuzzi was occupied by several hairy-chested Sinaloans who beckoned me to share their bottle of mezcal. I did so, and after clinking glasses and exchanging a few guarded speculations on United States-Mexico relations in the Trump era, I left them to stew in the frothing water and commenced what would become a multiday driving meander down the Guadalupe Valley’s Ruta de Vino.",
		"15" : "It’s a wine country unlike any I’ve come across. Start with the fact that in these parched environs, only splashes of vines are visible from the highway. Nowadays grapes grow in all sorts of places, but how they came to the valley is a peculiar tale. An obscure Russian sect of agrarian Christians known as the Molokans immigrated to Mexico around 1905 and put their farming talents to the test of the desert. The Molokans didn’t drink alcohol, but they sold their grapes to those who did.",
		"16" : "In 1988, a scientist of German ancestry named Hans Backoff Senior founded Monte Xanic and thereupon became the first maker of high-quality wines in the Valley. Others followed, and the oenologists they hired from France, Italy and Spain brought their native varietals with them. You would think the resulting wine would be a hopeless multicultural jumble, everywhere-tasting wine in the middle of nowhere.",
		"17" : "But then you would start drinking and stop quibbling. As one of the region’s pre-eminent winemakers, José Luis Durand, told me: “That eclecticism is part of our wine’s character. It expresses the freedom that our culture affords us.”",
		"18" : "I dined with Mr. Durand, a native Chilean, one evening in the unprepossessing oceanside city of Ensenada, a half-hour from the valley, at an Italian restaurant called Da Toni. My brilliant if endearingly attention-disordered companion makes deeply personal valley wines featuring far-flung grapes like nebbiolo and tannat.",
		"19" : "Elsewhere in Ensenada, at Sano’s, a dignified steakhouse, I washed down my filet mignon with a silky tempranillo-syrah blend from Norte 32, whose owner, a retired pilot named Oscar Obregón, beamed modestly as I stammered out praise.",
		"20" : "And one afternoon in the city I found, alongside a clutter of docked fishing boats, a sunny seafood shack named Muelle 3. The yellowfin tuna sashimi and shrimp puff pastry might have been flawless by themselves — but, leaving nothing to chance, I ordered a needle-sharp sauvignon blanc made by Wenceslao Martinez Santos of Relieve Winery, and perfection was assured.",
		"21" : "In the preceding paragraph I unintentionally made the case for simply staying in the poor man’s Cabo San Lucas of Ensenada where, in addition to the excellent restaurants, the usual beach hotels and tequila bars abound and the roads are paved. I won’t stop you, though you are especially likely to regret your choice should you linger in Ensenada in the middle of November, when the so-called Baja Mil procession of Americans in off-road vehicles makes its bellowing way down the thousand-mile coastline from Tijuana to Cabo. The serene rusticity of the valley has the feeling of a place rather than a playground.",
		"22" : "“If you come here directly from Napa, you’ll feel like you’re on a safari,” the winemaker Fernando Perez Castro said as we enjoyed a grand lunch of pig’s feet taquitos, tomato salad, radishes with black mole sauce and cabrito tortas (a sandwich of grilled baby goat) on the shady patio of TrasLomita, the restaurant on the premises of his family’s winery, Hacienda La Lomita. “But you see that this isn’t a place where big corporations have imposed a narrative. This is all about small families who actually live on the property. And along with making a tiny amount of high-quality wine, we’ve now brought tourism to the table. We’re giving our clients a full experience.”",
		"23" : "At certain sites like La Lomita, that experience — superb wine and food in a picturesque setting presided over by a charming host — feels unassailably complete. Or it would, if there were rooms. Once Kirsten arrived three days into my weeklong trip, we stayed two nights in the area’s oldest hotel, Adobe Guadalupe, an elegant inn built in 1999 by an American businessman and his Dutch wife, who came to the valley to make wine and raise horses. Today, according to its website, the hotel is the most prolific breeder of Azteca Sporthorses in the world, and guests may ride them through Adobe Guadalupe’s vineyards.",
		"24" : "As I prefer horses from a distance, we largely contented ourselves with the view from the hotel’s lovely pool, the armada of mountains providing a backdrop of surly majesty. Adobe Guadalupe’s conceit is that of a self-contained refuge. Its gracious courtyard and high-ceiling public rooms stocked with well-traveled books invite the visitor to proceed slowly, if at all.",
		"25" : "Just by the entrance, a gift shop of local crafts is also well stocked with early vintages of Adobe Guadalupe’s excellent wine at startlingly low prices. More recent versions of the same wine are available by the glass at the adjacent charming food truck, which sells flavorful if strangely non-Mexican snacks. The greater disappointment comes with Adobe Guadalupe’s dinners, which feature the banal sort of beef-and-asparagus fare one encounters at Middle American country clubs.",
		"26" : "Thus come evening we would find ourselves bumping down the unlit desert roads. One particular three-mile divot-riddled byway connecting two paved thoroughfares is the address for some of the valley’s best-regarded restaurants. These include the aforementioned veranda grill Finca Altozano; across the street, Brasa del Valle, another campestre-style restaurant emphasizing fresh ingredients; and a quarter-mile down the road, Laja, the valley’s venerated ranch-house establishment with a prix fixe menu that leans more to the Mediterranean than to down-home Mexican. From Adobe Guadalupe, the drive to each of these is a mere 10 minutes, though getting there is not half the fun.",
		"27" : "We were glad, then, to procure a room for our final night in the valley at Bruma Valle de Guadalupe, a first-class resort-in-the-making owned by Juan Pablo Arroyuelo, a restless Mexico City developer. When we visited, Bruma’s rambling complex consisted of six sleek guest rooms, a pool, dirt-biking trails, a vineyard, a kitchen for daytime meals and an architecturally stunning winery built out of recycled optical glass and discarded wooden beams from a San Francisco bridge.",
		"28" : "As of this writing, two suites with private pools have been added, along with two residential villas. And this month, the resort opened Fauna, an upscale restaurant whose chef, David Castro, has spent the last several years in the kitchens of Eleven Madison Park and Blue Hill at Stone Barns.",
		"29" : "Though we didn’t have benefit of the on-site restaurant during our stay, just outside of Bruma’s entrance lies La Esperanza BajaMed — a restaurant situated on one of the valley’s largest vineyards and which, in addition to delicious inland Mexican fare, serves outstanding plump oysters from the Pacific. I told Mr. Arroyuelo that after days of jostling from winery to hotel to restaurant, it was a relief to find a single area that encompassed pretty much everything we craved, requiring no nocturnal voyages.",
		"30" : "The valley’s most ambitious developer considered this. Then he said gravely: “We shouldn’t turn this into a tourist zone. It needs to stay rough.”",
		"31" : "So there will probably be more vineyards and delicacies and luxuries, but the same steadfast absence of polish when the time comes for us to revisit the Guadalupe Valley. And a return visit is pretty much guaranteed, not least because of an occurrence one evening at a long dirt road that dead-ended at La Villa del Valle, a splendid six-room inn cradled by the desert mountains where we stayed two pleasantly drowsy days.",
		"32" : "On one of those, after a day of poolside massages, we settled in for dinner at the hotel’s well-regarded restaurant Corazón de Tierra. There, at a table for two beside the kitchen where the servers rolled out bite after magnificently garden-fresh bite to accompany the fine local wine, I seized the moment, fell to one knee, held out the ring and asked my girlfriend to marry me.",
		"33" : "I’m afraid I don’t recall what dishes came after “yes.” But La Villa’s owner materialized with congratulatory champagne, roses appeared in our bedroom, and from our terrace a necklace of stars sparkled over the mountains — a desert evening of the unforgettable kind.",
		"34" : "La Villa del Valle, Rancho San Marcos Toros Pintos s/n km 88 +300, Francisco Zarco, lavilladelvalle.com. This six-room desert inn has an outdoor pool and yoga studio, excellent Mexican breakfasts, a winery made from recycled boats, and an acclaimed restaurant, Corazón de Tierra.

		"1" : "Oregon had never seemed so nasty. For two long days in 2013, I had bicycled south with two intrepid college friends along its coast, into a relentless gale, the rainy headwinds leaving us exhausted, our flat tires as frequent as East Coast potholes. Now we sat soaked on the side of a piney road, in the middle of nowhere, with no place to stay.",
		"2" : "One companion, ever the optimist, excitedly told us she had found an online organization with the fuzzy name of Warm Showers: “It’s like Couchsurfing for bike tourers,” she said, referring to the free-stay site for travelers.",
		"3" : "Warm Showers pairs itinerant bicyclists with hosts, who offer their homes at no charge. The hope is that the cyclists will themselves play host in turn.",
		"4" : "I was skeptical. I had cycled across the United States twice and never heard of it. How did we know this wasn’t a trap, set by predatory homebodies to lure naifs like us?",
		"5" : "But we were desperate, so we agreed to call Brian Heron, a nearby Warm Showers host. He showed up within 20 minutes, asking whether we needed a ride up the hill to his place and whether we liked pizza. (No, and yes.) We arrived at his house covered in mud and smelling like wet dogs. Mr. Heron, an ordained Presbyterian pastor who had first experienced Warm Showers as a guest on a 2011 bicycle trip across the West, told us to leave our gritty bikes in the front hallway (you wouldn’t want them to rust in the rain, he said) and to put our wet clothes in the dryer. Then he served us mountains of Hawaiian pizza, ice cream and brownies.",
		"6" : "Was this too good to be true?",
		"7" : "Warm Showers started small in 1993, but its website now lists 39,000 hosts and 89,000 bicycle tourers — people who hit the road for extended long-distance trips — in 175 countries. It is built, the website says, “on 100 percent reciprocal hospitality.” Hosts offer what they can: a couch, a room, or a place outside to pitch a tent, and sometimes meals, too. They receive no benefit other than the chance to make new friends and hear stories of the road. And unlike the for-profit Airbnb, Warm Showers is run by volunteers.",
		"8" : "“There’s something special about the Warm Showers cyclists,” Mr. Heron said. “They easily connect to that sense of adventure, being willing to take risks and be vulnerable. They get me, and I get them, and it’s always a delight.”",
		"9" : "How Warm Showers has succeeded in the face of everyday human frailty is something of a mystery, even to its founders. Only one significant theft has been reported, according to Louis Melini, a former board member, and only a handful of hosts have made guests uncomfortable enough for them to complain. (Both hosts and guests can post reviews online.) The offenders were promptly removed from the site.",
		"10" : "Of course, there have been cases in which guests have overstayed their welcome, hanging around for more than a night or two, monopolizing the host’s living room, and kitchen. Some guests have more colorful backgrounds than others. My mother, a Warm Showers host who joined the site in 2014 to repay the hospitality bestowed upon her daughter, learned by going online that a guest, staying downstairs on the living room sofa, had been accused of abusing his ex-wife. She was relieved when he pedaled off the next day. Another time, she returned home to find her guests of five days cooking up a meal and making a royal mess of the kitchen. But most of her memories of guests are fond ones, including the time one fell in love with her usually moody dog. Another sent her postcards for weeks after leaving.",
		"11" : "Happy matches are common. Some cyclists return year after year to hosts with whom they feel a special bond, and those riders may in turn open their own homes. Warm Showers expects cyclists treated with kindness to pass it forward, as Mr. Heron has.",
		"12" : "“In our society right now, we don’t know our neighbors, and we aren’t looking out for each other,” he said. “Warm Showers reminds me of something I loved as a child: trust, and taking care of each other, and stopping by the side of the road to help someone in trouble. That’s the kind of world I want to live in.”",
		"13" : "Due in part to that vibe, the organization has grown fast, attracting 20,000 new members in 2014 and 25,000 in 2015. Hosts can be found in countries including Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Zimbabwe and Ecuador.",
		"14" : "Stories are a bike tourer’s greatest currency, especially with hosts who have desk jobs and dream of returning to the road.",
		"15" : "Ethel MacDonald of Missoula, Mont., has stayed with 140 Warm Showers hosts all over the world, and recently celebrated her 77th birthday with a tour through Spain. One host has invited her to his daughter’s wedding in June. In turn, she has welcomed 150 cyclists into her home, she said.",
		"16" : "She gives her guests meals and a lot of attention. But she said she always assures them that “I’ve had hosts way better than this. I know how much this kind of treatment means. Pass it on.”",
		"17" : "Mr. Melini, 65, a physician assistant, was a Warm Showers board member from its founding through last summer. He and his wife, Julie, have a combined 25,000 bicycle touring miles and just finished hiking the Appalachian Trail, returning the hospitality they have received on the road when they are back home in Salt Lake City.",
		"18" : "One of the couple’s Warm Showers guests was Pablo Garcia, an Argentine who has cycled thousands of miles, on every continent. Another was Álvaro Neil, 50, of Spain, a lawyer who is also known as Biciclown, and who hopes to make it all the way around the world.",
		"19" : "Mr. Melini worries that Warm Showers lacks a sufficient number of hosts. Members regularly complain that they have contacted 10 and heard back from only one. “There are advantages to being big and advantages to being small,” he said. “You lose some of that purity when you get bigger, but you can provide more opportunities and options for bike travelers.”",
		"20" : "The organization is trying to make it more difficult to sign up as a guest without also becoming a host, encouraging new users to list themselves as both. It’s a tough ask, as many bike travelers don’t spend much time in one place.",
		"21" : "Ken Francis of Long Beach, Calif., who has cycled across the country three times, finally bought a house with a yard that he deemed adequate to host cyclists with tents. He has since responded to each of the more than 75 people who have contacted him through the website.",
		"22" : "One reason he’s so eager to welcome other cyclists is his belief that hosts on his own early trips led him to a career as a therapist. After just two trips, he realized how much he enjoyed talking with those he met on the road. “I really enjoyed just listening to people and hearing people’s stories,” he said, “and I thought wow, to have a job where that’s what I do would just be an amazing thing.”",
		"23" : "My friends and I stayed with several Warm Showers hosts during our ride from Seattle to San Francisco, including Phillip Michael Long of Kelso, Ore. We never had a chance to thank him; he was off to work before we hit the road the next morning.",
		"24" : "Our final hosts were Linda and Dave Allen of Santa Rosa, Calif., who put us up the night before we rolled into San Francisco, on the Fourth of July. They told us about Dave’s cross-country trip on a bicycle with a giant front wheel, requiring him to use a footstool to reach the seat. And of their 16 years sailing the world. And how they had ridden an antique tandem across Europe.",
		"25" : "Empty nesters, they took us in as if we were their children’s childhood friends. We churned ice cream on the back porch, adding blackberries the couple had just picked. They found some old sparklers in their basement, and we all ran around barefoot on their back lawn, watching them glow."

		"1" : "There’s a ballet dancer on the television show “The Americans,” but she doesn’t dance one step. And that makes for a happy ballerina.",
		"2" : "Irina Dvorovenko, a former principal with American Ballet Theater, has been quietly forging a second career as an actress since she left the company in 2013. The same month that she retired from Ballet Theater, she triumphed as Vera Baronova in the Encores! production of “On Your Toes” at City Center. Her success was a surprise — even to her.",
		"3" : "While Vera is a standard part for a ballet dancer — George Balanchine choreographed the first Broadway production in 1936 — what really stood out was Ms. Dvorovenko’s unassailable comic timing. She was hooked. Acting turned into a passion, just as ballet had once been.",
		"4" : "Since then, her most prominent role had been as a drug-addicted ballerina on the Starz series “Flesh and Bone.” But with this season of FX’s “The Americans,” on which she plays the Soviet émigré Evgheniya Morozova, the game has changed.",
		"5" : "“It’s a different character for me,” she said in a recent interview at Cafe Fiorello near Lincoln Center, where her name — along with that of her dancer-husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, and their daughter, Emma — is inscribed on a plaque in one of the booths. “I really want to be seen as a different person and to show an absolutely different side of me. Nothing related to dance.”",
		"6" : "On “The Americans,” which stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as undercover Soviet spies in the United States during the Cold War, Ms. Dvorovenko plays a forlorn, isolated woman with a depressed son and a husband who has embraced his new country. Ms. Dvorovenko is somewhat unrecognizable in the role: Sallow and drawn, her usually glittering sapphire eyes disappear into the camera with piercing melancholy. As it happens, it’s not the biggest stretch.",
		"7" : "“It’s my childhood,” she said.",
		"8" : "Ms. Dvorovenko, born in 1973, grew up in Ukraine with dancer parents and studied gymnastics before entering ballet school at 10. For her, the show’s time period has brought back a flood of memories. Many have to do with hunting for food. (In the transcript of our interview, that word comes up 21 times.) In one scene, her character shows dismay at the abundance of groceries in the United States; Ms. Dvorovenko said she understands Evgheniya’s shock.",
		"9" : "“When perestroika happened, the stores were completely empty,” she said, adding that her husband remembers waiting, at the age of 10 or 11, for a store to open and grabbing whatever he could. “They were literally bending the metal cages to grab the raw chicken. We never had gyms — the workout was eight or 10 hours a day to run all over the area to find the food in any possible store. Women never smiled.”",
		"10" : "While on tour with the National Opera and Ballet Theater of Ukraine in the early 1990s, she said she and her fellow dancers were on a mission: to bring home as much food as possible. Ms. Dvorovenko pointed to a table to indicate how large her bag was. “You unzip, unzip, unzip?” she said, with a giggle. “You have, like, a dead body in it.”",
		"11" : "The show’s wardrobe brings back memories, too. Ms. Dvorovenko’s description of it? Ugly. “The only colors people were wearing were brown, black and dark gray,” she said. “My parents were different because they were traveling to the West to perform, and they were buying fancy clothes. I was embarrassed to wear them because none of my childhood friends had any.”",
		"12" : "Clearly Ms. Dvorovenko had the experience to play Evgheniya. But before she could nail the role, she had to tone down her look. Willowy and seductive, with a deep voice and a contagious smile, Ms. Dvorovenko is no wallflower. After her first audition, she was deemed too glamorous.",
		"13" : "Her husband gave her some advice. He told her to take a ballet class, clean the apartment, have a fight with their daughter and cry. “He said, ‘Then you’ll be totally miserable,’” she recounted. Instead, she took off her makeup, pulled out her cellphone and shot a video of herself. “I put on a different attitude and I just said a few words: ‘My name is Irina Dvorovenko, and I’m auditioning for the role of Evgheniya.’”",
		"14" : "They called her back the next morning. “I came very plain in a T-shirt, and they felt my sensitive side and vulnerability and also the struggle with what I’m going through as a mother — as a normal person,” she said. “I’m not all the time chic and glamorous. I also can be sad and have real problems.”",
		"15" : "Chris Long, an executive producer and director, said: “We made her work hard to get this part. It was very important to us that this family worked. One of the great things about casting these Russians is you never want to see them in any way act. She has a beautiful naturalness to her.”",
		"16" : "Ms. Dvorovenko appears in nine of 13 episodes this season and doesn’t yet know if she will return for the show’s next and final season. But in the fall, she’ll participate in her second workshop of Susan Stroman’s “The Beast in the Jungle,” a story told through music, dance and narration that is loosely based on the Henry James novella. Ms. Dvorovenko portrays May, a ballerina, at ages 20, 40 and 60. “It was incredible to live the full life of the character,” she said.",
		"17" : "Ms. Stroman, in an email, noted Ms. Dvorovenko’s depth and warmth, which allowed for May’s “curious nature and her intellect to shine through.”",
		"18" : "And Ms. Dvorovenko is eager to continue acting. “I’ve been talking all my life onstage inside my head,” she said. “Even for nonstory ballets, I would talk inside. And now I have a crazy urge for people to be able to see me closely. Not just my movements, but to look in my eyes.”",
		"19" : "She shook her head firmly. “I don’t miss ‘Swan Lake.’”",
		"20" : "Or, it seems, the ballet world. “Through my career, I never felt important,” she said. But making “The Americans” feels different. “Here is a team of people who actually believe in you, and they know their business and they navigate and nourish you.”",
		"21" : "She recalled a look that a veteran cameraman gave her after a difficult scene. “It was a little glimpse of something like, ‘Kid, you’re doing well,’” Ms. Dvorovenko said. “Little things sometimes make such a huge difference, right? It gave me so much encouragement and strength.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Early in “American Gods,” a new Starz series based on Neil Gaiman’s acclaimed 2001 novel, an old grifter played by Ian McShane sneers at America’s existential anxiety.",
		"2" : "“This is the only country in the world that wonders what it is,” he mutters.",
		"3" : "He doesn’t know the half of it — the scene was written and shot months before a polarizing presidential contest and new administration made fretting over the soul of America a national pastime. But it’s just one of the ways that this audacious series, debuting Sunday, April 30, possesses surprising relevancy for a 16-year-old story about deities that have been worshiped for millenniums.",
		"4" : "“American Gods,” at its core, is a road story about an ex-con named Shadow (Ricky Whittle), who takes up with Mr. McShane’s enigmatic Mr. Wednesday. Their mission involves a rivalry between fading “old gods” — ancient mythological figures like Loki, Kali and Anansi, who were brought to life in America via the beliefs of immigrants — and new gods who have arisen to replace them, borne of more modern obsessions like technology and celebrity. Phantasmagorical and terrifically violent high jinks ensue, among other arresting visuals. (A reanimated corpse totes her amputated arm like a satchel. A love goddess consumes partners with her vagina.)",
		"5" : "But beneath the extraordinary imagery is a story about the power and evolution of faith, and of immigrants who helped to build and define American culture, only to see said culture turn against them. This overarching theme, as well as smaller vignettes about American newcomers, have taken on the sheen of advocacy, the show’s overseers say, since Donald J. Trump’s election and proposed immigration bans.",
		"6" : "The show, which finished shooting in October, was never planned as a political statement. But “what has changed, bizarrely and drastically and unfortunately, is that now immigration is seen by too many as something to be vilified,” said Michael Green, who created the series with Bryan Fuller.",
		"7" : "The new gods’ hold on the American mindshare has also become exponentially more consuming since the book was written, years before Facebook, TMZ or iPhones. All of which suggests that while various “American Gods” adaptations have been proposed since the novel came out, to no avail, there’s never been a better time for one to come to fruition.",
		"8" : "“Speculative fiction usually ages very badly,” Mr. Gaiman said. But in this case “the stuff that I wanted to talk about 17 years ago feels more apt, and more important, to talk about now.”",
		"9" : "Conceptual underpinnings mean little without a compelling story, of course, but the showrunners’ backgrounds prepared them to adapt a magical realist genre classic like “American Gods.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Fuller’s flair for hypnotic world-building and operatic, hallucinatory violence found full bloom in “Hannibal,” another reimagining of a beloved literary property (Thomas Harris’s Hannibal Lecter novels). Mr. Green is another veteran refresher of pop myths, as the screenwriter for “Logan,” based on the X-Men character, and “Blade Runner 2049,” due out later this year.",
		"11" : "The show they created, as Mr. Whittle put it, “is bananas,” a neo-noir head trip mashing up mythology, science fiction and stylized gore — think slow-motion splashes of blood set to brooding cellos — as it reveals the specifics of Mr. Wednesday’s quest. Like the novel, it skips around through time and space and blurs the border between reality and a more fantastical realm, lurking just below mundane American landscapes.",
		"12" : "The casting gods have been generous. Veteran performers on hand include Cloris Leachman, Orlando Jones, Crispin Glover and Kristin Chenoweth. Corbin Bernsen is Vulcan, a god of fire who has found common cause with gun enthusiasts. Gillian Anderson plays the goddess Media, first appearing as Lucille Ball and, in another scene, speaking in David Bowie lyrics.",
		"13" : "And of course for the cagey rogue Mr. Wednesday, the producers have, in Mr. McShane, television’s pre-eminent portrayer of cagey rogues. (See also Al Swearengen from “Deadwood,” as well as the title character from “Lovejoy,” the series that made him a star in England.)",
		"14" : "“I wasn’t looking to do a TV show,” he said. “But this isn’t a normal TV show.”",
		"15" : "For Starz, “American Gods” fits within a strategy that favors high-end genre tales with a built-in audience, like its “Outlander,” another literary adaptation. Fantasy stories in particular have a potential to connect with viewers’ inner children, said the Starz president Chris Albrecht, who ran HBO when the network acquired the rights to “Game of Thrones” in 2007.",
		"16" : "They “can be unlocked and enjoyed by almost everyone,” he said. “Certainly ‘Thrones’ has been an example of that, and we hope a show like ‘American Gods’ can follow in those footsteps.”",
		"17" : "Mr. Gaiman, who grew up in England but moved to the United States in 1992, was driven to write “American Gods” by an urge to understand and describe his new home. This celebrated author of both comics (“The Sandman”) and novels (“Neverwhere”) reached a new level of success with “American Gods,” a best-seller that won major prizes for fantasy and science fiction and horror. (He still plans to write a sequel.)",
		"18" : "The expansive story was “intentionally not film-shaped,” Mr. Gaiman said, but directors still made inquiries over the years. HBO planned to adapt it into a series at one point — Mr. Gaiman worked on several drafts of a pilot — but nothing came of it.",
		"19" : "After Stefanie Berk, an executive who had helped develop the project for HBO, moved to the production conglomerate FremantleMedia North America, she revisited the idea with Mr. Gaiman. (FremantleMedia is producing the series.) In 2014, they met with Mr. Fuller, then overseeing “Hannibal,” who knew Mr. Green from their time working together on NBC’s “Heroes.”",
		"20" : "The writers approached the story as devotees first, asking themselves “what do you want to see in a TV show, as a fan of this material?” Mr. Fuller said. They also had the ideal consultant in Mr. Gaiman, a heavily involved executive producer who weighed in on casting, read scripts and offered guidance about the story’s direction.",
		"21" : "“There was only one time Neil said, ‘If you do this, I will throw myself in front of a bus,’” Mr. Fuller said, referring to a plot point the showrunners were considering. “And we said, ‘O.K., we won’t do that.’”",
		"22" : "So far, Starz has only officially committed to the first eight-episode season, which gets through roughly a third of the book. But the creators estimate that they have enough material for perhaps five, based on related stories Mr. Gaiman has written and ideas he has, as well as their own significant expansions of the source material.",
		"23" : "Several of the novel’s “Coming to America” essays, short discrete immigrant stories, were woven into the overarching narrative. The show is bringing a story of diversity and a multiethnic cast to television at a time when movies like “Ghost in the Shell” and series like “Iron Fist” have brought new complaints about pop culture whitewashing, or using white actors for minority characters.",
		"24" : "“We’re just doing what always should be done,” Mr. Fuller said.",
		"25" : "If the immigrant tales give “American Gods” additional political heft, well, it’s in good company. A wide range of TV shows have acquired new meaning and resonance with the arrival of President Trump and his policies, including political shows like “Veep”; social issues series like “Shots Fired”; and even dystopian sagas like Hulu’s new adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale.”",
		"26" : "But though the pro-immigrant stance of “American Gods” was not planned in response to the new administration, Mr. Gaiman is “perfectly happy” for any viewers who might take issue with such a position to skip the series. “I can guarantee you wouldn’t enjoy it, so boycotting it is probably a very sensible way to go,” he said.",
		"27" : "The showrunners also expanded the roles of memorable but fleetingly seen characters, like Mad Sweeney (Pablo Schreiber), a hulking, luckless leprechaun.",
		"28" : "Female characters, especially, were broadened to make the story less of “a sausage party,” said Emily Browning, the Australian actress who plays Laura Moon, Shadow’s dead but very active wife. Laura and the ancient love goddess Bilquis, played by the Nigerian actress Yetide Badaki, are much more prominent in the show than they were in the book.",
		"29" : "Ms. Badaki was charged with executing one of the book’s most famous and provocative set pieces, in which Bilquis, also known as the Queen of Sheba, ends a one-night stand by ingesting her lover. Outré mechanics notwithstanding, Ms. Badaki related to the underlying premise of a goddess of love struggling in a more emotionally withdrawn era. “If you’ve ever dated online, you definitely get that there is this loss of connection and intimacy,” she said.",
		"30" : "While there’s no shortage of indelible imagery, the most powerful examples connect to the show’s deeper themes about faith, identity and modern American values.",
		"31" : "The creators are “particularly excited to see how viewers respond to the Salim story,” Mr. Fuller said, a subplot about a gay Muslim man that includes an explicit, transmogrifying sex scene with a genie.",
		"32" : "In the second episode, Mr. Jones’s African god, Anansi, drives a ship full of slaves to rebellion with a stirring monologue about the indignities black men will endure in America. At the end of the scene, the 40 actors playing slaves gave Mr. Jones a spontaneous ovation.",
		"33" : "“That was our first realization that some of the buttons we were pushing may have been hotter than we anticipated,” Mr. Fuller said.",
		"34" : "Mr. Green said: “You never know what people are going to be challenged by,” adding, “so we look forward to them telling us.”"

A new anthology, “A Grace Paley Reader,” contains some of those stories, a selection of poems and several essays that show a different side of the writer.",
		"2" : "Paley, raised by two socialist parents in the Bronx, was always politically active. She once said that raising children and staying engaged in politics were two of the factors that limited her fiction output. (“Art is too long, and life is too short.”)",
		"3" : "Her essays won’t be mistaken for classics, and in fairness they don’t read as though she intended them to be. They’re partisan dispatches from a certain moment in time, one that echoes our own. She writes about her own experience with abortion and her view of sexual politics; about spending a few days in jail for protesting the Vietnam War (“I slept well for some reason, probably the hard mattress. I don’t seem to mind where I am”); about the Persian Gulf war of 1991; and about the global struggle for women’s rights (“We are in the hands of men whose power and wealth have separated them from the reality of daily life and from the imagination. We are right to be afraid”).",
		"4" : "George Saunders provides a wonderful introduction, in which he describes what he finds so brilliant about Paley’s voice, especially in the fiction. “Paley is, for me, a kind of secular saint,” he writes. “What is a saint? Someone particularly attentive to things as they are and extraordinarily accepting of them. Paley honors every person and thing she creates by presenting them at their best, or at least their liveliest — which may be the same thing.”",

(The authors previously released a similar, best-selling treatment of the 9/11 Commission’s findings.) “Shocking though it was in the 21st century,” Jane Mayer writes in an introduction to the new book, “the issue of torture became just one more political football” after the Senate issued its conclusions. “Some of the material is graphic, but this makes it a perfect subject for graphic depiction.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "It’s gone now, replaced by a small, unobtrusive park, but in the middle of the 20th century the Stork Club, on East 53rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, was the center of an emerging national culture of celebrity. As Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of “a person who is known for his well-knownness.” And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fame’s sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a mélange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the club’s Table 50. In Winchell’s reporting, “The death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance,” Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. “Dozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated.” Winchell’s reach was enormous. One listener recalled “strolling one Sabbath evening for six blocks through a residential section of Birmingham [Alabama] and never losing a word of W.W.’s broadcast as his voice came through a succession of open windows.”",
		"2" : "Virtually forgotten in our own time, Winchell is an undeniable architect of the way we live now — which makes Gabler’s biography essential reading. “A mention in his column or on his broadcast meant one was among the exalted,” Gabler wrote. “It meant that one’s name was part of the general fund of knowledge. It meant that one’s exploits, even if they were only the exploits of dining, rated acknowledgment. It meant that one’s life was validated.” Politically, Winchell, once an enthusiastic booster of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s, claimed to have introduced the New York lawyer (and later Donald Trump mentor) Roy Cohn to Senator Joseph McCarthy and the broadcaster’s program became a platform for the Red-baiting of the 1950s. Culturally, Winchell helped create the ambient world of celebrity that permanently blurred the lines between politics, policy, sports and entertainment. “This culture,” according to Gabler, “would bind an increasingly diverse, mobile and atomized nation until it became, in many respects, America’s dominant ethos, celebrity consciousness our new common denominator.”",
		"3" : "To understand the narcissism of the first decades of the 21st century, it may help to realize that it is neither a sudden nor an entirely new phenomenon. “There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about,” Oscar Wilde’s Lord Henry remarked in 1890’s “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” “and that is not being talked about.” The world Wilde anticipated and Winchell crystallized can be explained by a few key texts that illuminate how we find ourselves with a president of the United States who used to call up New York tabloid writers (and would very likely have called Winchell, had Winchell still been around) posing as Trump spokesman “John Miller” or “John Barron” to talk about … himself.",
		"4" : "Much of what Winchell wrought was described in philosophical terms by Boorstin in the oft-quoted (but less read) “The Image.” Aside from his definition of fame — a similar point to Andy Warhol’s better-known remark that in the future everybody would be famous for 15 minutes — Boorstin’s key contribution was the notion of modern life as a series of “pseudo-events.” A pseudo-event, Boorstin wrote, was, first, “not spontaneous, but comes about because someone has planned, planted or incited it. Typically, it is not a train wreck or an earthquake, but an interview” — or a tweet. Second, it is “planted primarily … for the immediate purpose of being reported or reproduced. Therefore, its occurrence is arranged for the convenience of the reporting or reproducing media.”",
		"5" : "Public life in particular is thus not organic but manufactured and manipulated for the maximum advantage of those doing the manufacturing and the manipulating. Winchell’s pal Joe McCarthy was, in Boorstin’s words, “a natural genius at creating reportable happenings that had an interestingly ambiguous relation to underlying reality.” As Richard Rovere of The New Yorker wrote in his book about the senator’s rise to power, McCarthy “invented the morning press conference called for the purpose of announcing an afternoon press conference. The reporters would come in … and McCarthy would say that he just wanted to give them the word that he expected to be ready with a shattering announcement later in the day, for use in the papers the following morning. This would gain him a headline in the afternoon papers: ‘New McCarthy Revelations Awaited in Capital.’ Afternoon would come, and if McCarthy had something, he would give it out, but often enough he had nothing, and this was a matter of slight concern. He would simply say that he wasn’t quite ready, that he was having difficulty in getting some of the ‘documents’ he needed or that a ‘witness’ was proving elusive. Morning headlines: ‘Delay Seen in New McCarthy Case — Mystery Witness Being Sought.’” And so McCarthy, simply by asserting things that may or may not have had any connection to reality, dominated the life of the age.",
		"6" : "For a grand but accessible view of the evolution (or, depending on your point of view, devolution) of technology and culture, Neil Postman’s 1985 AMUSING OURSELVES TO DEATH: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business is indispensable. Linking our changing consciousness to fundamental shifts in the means of human communication, Postman identifies two key turning points: the move from speech to text and from text to moving images. “To engage the written word means to follow a line of thought, which requires considerable powers of classifying, inference-making and reasoning,” Postman writes. “It means to uncover lies, confusions and overgeneralizations, to detect abuses of logic and common sense. It also means to weigh ideas, to compare and contrast assertions, to connect one generalization to another.” The Enlightenment was made possible in large measure by the rise of mass print as the principal means of discourse, creating, according to Postman, “a definition of intelligence that gave priority to the objective, rational use of the mind and at the same time encouraged forms of public discourse with serious, logically ordered content.” Once the telegraph was introduced, displacing books and pamphlets, news began coming with unprecedented speed, shortening attention spans — a development that grew exponentially with television. Suddenly “the typographic mind,” in Postman’s formulation, was supplanted by a “peek-a-boo world” of journalistic and political showmanship. More information than ever was now available to more people, but in shorter bursts that newspapers and periodicals and then radio began to use as fodder for drama rather than exposition or illumination. “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate,” Henry David Thoreau wrote in “Walden.” “We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.”",
		"7" : "Then the introduction of television made the telegraphic era seem quaint. The point of television, Postman argues, is to entertain, not to educate — thus, as any viewer of contemporary television news knows, the motive force of such programming, and therefore of the conduct of our minute-to-minute political life, is the classic elements of drama: conflict, novelty and clearly identifiable heroes and villains. (Or at least clearly identifiable for that segment; the imperative to keep the story moving, the perennial imperative of dramatists since the world began, means “breaking news” often connotes a shift in who’s the hero and who’s the villain for that given moment.)",
		"8" : "Postman died before the invention of social media, but it doesn’t take much to apply his arguments to the age of Trump. Twitter is a kind of 21st-century telegraph, bringing us bursts of news and opinion with little to no context, appealing to the emotions rather than to the intellect; the typographic mind requires more than 140 characters to do its work. Cable news offers us dramatic serials, entertaining in their twists and turns and outsize characters — or, to be more precise, its outsize character, the 45th president. It’s Walter Winchell’s world. The rest of us are just living in it."

		"1" : "Literature and power cannot be separated. American literature is read around the world not only because of its inherent value, but because the rest of the world always reads the literature of empires. A new development is that the American way of teaching writing is beginning to spread globally. The writing workshop, with all its unexamined assumptions, has spread to Britain and Hong Kong, a model of pedagogy that is also an object lesson in how power propagates and conceals itself.",
		"2" : "Not accidentally, the “workshop” invokes the nobility of craftsmanship, physical (not intellectual) labor — and masculinity. As Junot Díaz and Claire Vaye Watkins have argued, the workshop can be a hostile place for women and people of color.",
		"3" : "This was my experience as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, studying with mostly white students. I worried that my historical and political concerns — my autobiography as a refugee from war, from an Asian country — wouldn’t find a receptive audience.",
		"4" : "My concerns were not without reason. In “The Program Era,” Mark McGurl has pointed out how the workshop produces a particular kind of writing, and in “Workshops of Empire,” Eric Bennett situated the workshop’s origins in the midcentury American fear of Communism. Reacting against the rising proletarianism of American writing before World War II and the specter of Soviet power, American writer-teachers promoted the idea of creative writing as a defense of the individual and his humanistic expression. Politics and the spirit of collectives would not be in fashion.",
		"5" : "What would be in fashion: voice, experience, and showing rather than telling. So it is that workshops typically focus on strategies of the writing “art” that develop character, setting, time, description, theme, voice and, to a lesser extent, plot. Plot is usually seen by workshop writer-teachers, or teacher-writers, as the property of so-called “genre” writing: science fiction, crime, romance, young adult and screenplays — as if literary fiction were not also a genre.",
		"6" : "As a young aspiring writer, I was troubled by how these workshops, aside from the “art” of writing, did not have anything to say about the matters that concerned me: politics, history, theory, philosophy, ideology. How does one write a poem, a short story or a novel that deals with any of these things? I did not realize at the time that such issues were often beyond the horizon of concern of the workshop because they threatened its very origins.",
		"7" : "As an institution, the workshop reproduces its ideology, which pretends that “Show, don’t tell” is universal when it is, in fact, the expression of a particular population, the white majority, typically at least middle-class and often, but not exclusively, male. The identity behind the workshop’s origins is invisible. Like all privileges, this identity is unmarked until it is thrown into relief against that which is marked, visible and outspoken, which is to say me and others like me.",
		"8" : "We, the barbarians at the gate, the descendants of Caliban, the ones who have no choice but to speak in the language we have — we come bearing the experiences and ideas the workshop suppresses. We come from the Communist countries America bombed during the Cold War, or where it sponsored counter-Communist efforts. We come from the lands America occupied, invaded or colonized. We come as refugees and immigrants, documented and undocumented. We come from the ghettos, barrios, reservations and borders of America where there are no workshops. We come from the bedrooms and the kitchens of the American home, where we were supposed to stay, and stay silent. We come speaking languages other than English. We come from the margins, where English is broken. We come with financial aid and loans and families that do not understand what “creative writing” is. We come from communities we do not wish to renounce in the name of our individualism. We come wanting to do more than just sell our stories to white audiences. And we come with the desire not just to show, but to tell.",
		"9" : "But what is that art that is also political, historical, theoretical, ideological and philosophical? How is it to be taught? It must be taught not only as an isolated craft or a set of techniques. It must be taught in relation to, or within, courses on history, politics, theory and philosophy, as well as ethnic studies, gender studies, queer studies and cultural studies.",
		"10" : "The history and aesthetics of the workshop must be made visible rather than assumed, and the capacity of writing to save lives and change the world must be seen not as something that is innate only to the writing but as something that is enabled by, and in turn enables, social movements, revolutions and the struggle for power. In short, the answer is not to be found solely in the workshop, which is why it is worrisome that so many writers of color, women writers and working-class writers who are excluded from the model of the workshop continue to subscribe to its powers. As if, Flannery O’Connor (herself the graduate of the most famous workshop of all, at the University of Iowa) said, the workshop wasn’t a case of the blind leading the blind."

I think the closest she ever came to baking was spearing bright orange peanut-shaped marshmallows on a carving fork and toasting them over the stove. When I married — I was 19 and a college junior — the only culinary experience I could claim was burning down my parents’ kitchen seven years earlier, a misadventure involving frozen fries and boiling oil.",
		"2" : "Marriage (and a budget constrained by student loans) made me a cook; my mother-in-law inadvertently made me a baker.",
		"3" : "She was a funny, spirited woman who was guarded, cool and singularly unsentimental, except when she talked about her parents, both bakers by trade. Her expression would soften as she remembered the warm cinnamon buns that waited for her after school. Watching her mime the motions of spreading sweet butter on a freshly baked poppy-seed roll — every bit of the roll’s surface had to be covered — was like hearing her declare: My family loved me!",
		"4" : "Could baking really do that? If it could, I wanted to bake.",
		"5" : "The galvanizing experience, the one that sent me into the kitchen, occurred the evening I dropped by my mother-in-law’s house in Brooklyn. I found her whistling and making knishes, those potato pies I’d have sworn only machines could produce. I barely had time to take off my coat before she pushed the dough toward me. “Touch it,” she said, “Feel how silky it is — this is how it should feel.”",
		"6" : "I’d never touched dough before then, or even seen anyone bake. But something about my mother-in-law’s almost childish delight in what she had made, and the way she looked at me when she placed the dough in my hands, stayed with me.",
		"7" : "She gave me the recipe, and on the way home, I bought flour. I found a little counter space in our made-for-gnomes kitchen and set to work. The last instructions my mother-in-law gave me were my mantra: If the dough is dry, add more oil; if it’s wet, add more flour. And so I added more oil and added more flour and added more and more until I had a mountain of dough that was as rough as a horse blanket. I went to bed knishless.",
		"8" : "Had I been more experienced, more attuned to the language of baking, I might have understood that everything I needed to know about that dough was in my hands. Had I held more dough, I would have known to cup my hands around it, to rub my thumbs against the surface, heft the ball, sink my fingers into it, tug at it to discover if it stretched, if it sprang back, if it was airy or tight. But my hands didn’t know enough then. Today they’re my trustiest tool.",
		"9" : "I lift pie crust from the counter on my palms, fit it into the pan and then flute the edges with my fingers. I shape bread dough into loaves by hand. Using every part of my hands, I coax a thin sponge cake into a jelly roll (and there isn’t a time when I don’t take a moment to admire the chubby spiral I’ve crafted). Crescent cookies are formed with my fingers, not perfectly, not evenly, but with pleasure — a pleasure similar to the one I feel when I twist puff pastry into long curlicues or pleat it to make elephant-ear cookies.",
		"10" : "Baking is handwork, and for me, all that is joyful, comforting, gratifying and even magical about this work is packed into the simple act of making biscuits. I practice a kind of meditation while I make them. I concentrate on how each step feels — not so much because it makes a better biscuit (which it does) or because it’s more satisfying (which it is), but because I like having my senses on high alert, anticipating and responding to the dough’s changes. With apron on and sleeves rolled high (biscuits are a messy business), I dig my hands into the flour and butter and mash, squeeze, smoosh and press the ingredients together, watching the cold butter jump from my fingers at first and then feeling it yield as it warms and softens and I fall into the rhythm of it. I love how the dough is lumpy, how I find chunks of butter here, shards there, and how the higgledy-piggledy mixture teeters toward hopelessness until I reach into the bowl again to knead and fold it. And when, under my hands, the misshapen nuggets become the dough they’re meant to be, I’m still always surprised.",
		"11" : "By the time I pry open the baked biscuits, cover them with strawberries — some gently cooked into jam, some fresh and glistening with sugar — and top it all with whipped cream, my handprints are baked into them. So are a large measure of joy and a small pinch of hope: Maybe what I’ve baked will linger in someone’s memory; and maybe, just maybe, it will make a new baker.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Rei Kawakubo is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who has been making monochromatic, boiled, overstuffed, unraveling, surreal clothes since she began her label, Comme des Garçons, in 1969. In the ’80s, an era of triangular fluorescent shoulders and moussed bangs, she sent widow’s weeds trailing down the runway. In the ’90s, her clothes grew tumors that resembled bustles, blurring the lines between illness and beauty, what to look at and what to look away from. While her stores stock simple cotton poplin shirts as well as more challenging lumpen jackets and her runway shows present one-off sculptures, the through-line is a thoughtful rejection of should and a strong feeling of perhaps. The name of her label, which translates to “Like the Boys,” is a quiet, defiant shrug.",
		"2" : "Over the decades, Kawakubo has returned to certain proportions and themes. A Peter Pan collar. An A-line skirt. A uniform. A cocoon. Her variations on these natural and childlike shapes present a distilled and dreamy version of dress. When I think of her clothes, my mind fishes up an image I saw over 20 years ago in a magazine: Two women stood in a dirt road. One wore a dress that struck me as utterly unflattering, until it didn’t. Then it struck me as beautiful. Innocent. The shape of a doll’s dress. The skirt hit midcalf, flat shoes, legs sturdy. In that moment, I understood the difference between being looked at and looking at yourself. Squarely and generously. The difference between sartorial safety and statement.",
		"3" : "Kawakubo’s clothes don’t move from day to evening. They don’t flatter. They don’t slim. They don’t fit perfectly or offer comfort or reassurance. But then, given a beat, they do all of the above. They are not simply clothes: They are ideas. They are feelings. Kawakubo once said that her collections begin as “nonverbal, abstract images inside of me.”",
		"4" : "In May, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute will present an exhibition of Kawakubo’s work — the first show of a living fashion designer since an Yves Saint Laurent exhibit in 1983. It will bring together nearly 40 years of her baffling and beautiful designs for a wonderfully awkward parade.",
		"5" : "On a recent spring day, Erik Madigan Heck photographed six pieces from Kawakubo’s fall 2017 collection — called “Future of Silhouette” — on the Dutch model Saskia de Brauw. The clothes are made from raw material that Kawakubo calls “nonfabrics”: what appeared to be cauterized rubber, rug pads, cotton batting, stuffing and duct tape. The hairstylist and artist Julien d’Ys’s headpieces, which also appeared in the runway show, were made of pot scrubbers from a Paris supermarket.",
		"6" : "When I arrived at the studio where the shoot took place, the garments were still sealed in enormous FedEx boxes, crated like Count Dracula for their voyage from Tokyo. They emerged with help from a white-gloved team and were hung on rolling racks.",
		"7" : "In a YouTube video I watched of the Paris catwalk show, the pieces looked like foil balls, lint bunnies, craft paper and wool felt. In person, they still did. But close up, they were meticulously and gorgeously constructed; their rough-hewed, blunted exteriors encased in thoughtful and ergonomic scaffolding, buttresses of padded wiring, canvas boning, industrial-strength crinolines.",
		"8" : "Kawakubo reluctantly titles her collections after they are designed: “Mud-Dyed” (spring 1985); “Ultrasimple” (spring 1993); “Abstract Excellence” (spring 2004); “Bad Taste” (fall 2008); “2 Dimensions” (fall 2012). She claims she just does this for journalists, preferring observers to come to their own conclusions. I found myself nicknaming the six pieces: Bubble Bath, Calamari, Linty, Jiffy Pop, Vase and Red.",
		"9" : "Since her spring 2014 collection, “Not Making Clothing,” Kawakubo has stopped showing conventionally wearable ensembles on the runway, and her collections have become more extreme, unwieldy and conceptual. This later work illustrates the version of clothes that are inside our heads and hearts and bodies: the contradictions, the indecisions and the architecture of the subconscious. Looking at Kawakubo’s Rorschach-like new creations, I’m led through a free association of my own memories and emotions.",

		"12" : "In 2008, I saw Fiona Shaw as Winnie in the Samuel Beckett play “Happy Days.” Her Winnie was a cheerful wife who in the first act was buried up to her waist, then in the second act up to her neck, in a mound of dirt. She prattled on to her husband and dug around in her black matelassé purse. “So little to say, so little to do, and the fear so great,” she chirps.",
		"13" : "This garment is a land mine of artistic references. There is a photograph of the artist Louise Bourgeois, taken in 1975. She is standing in front of her New York City stoop, wearing a latex cast of her bubbling sculpture “Avenza” from the late ’60s. Its clusters presage Kawakubo’s nippled creation, and the similarity is reassuring and funny, like mother-and-daughter matching outfits. Speaking of these organic forms, Bourgeois said, “If you hold a naked child against your naked breast, it is not the end of softness, it is the beginning of softness, it is life itself.”",
		"14" : "Like Beckett and Bourgeois, Kawakubo maps the empty spaces within us. Pulling the self inside out and outside in. Palettes of mud, pillowcases of doorknobs, bags of ice.",

		"16" : "At a certain point in my late 30s, I sought out quilted things. Quilted jackets, quilted boots, quilted trousers, quilted quilts. I found a long pink coat from the ’80s with duffel buttons, a Bill Blass parka that resembled a sectioned bar of milk chocolate, a Norma Kamali bomber with puffy linebacker shoulders. A huge comforter in muted taupes, stitched in a grid of rainbow curves.",
		"17" : "I’d had a baby the year before. My body was different, bigger in places, smaller in others. I was happier with how I looked. I liked looking older. But as my baby grew, my fears grew. I wanted to be buffered, padded. I wanted more room between outside and inside. For her. For us.",
		"18" : "Being a mother made me more punk, more angry, righteous, foul-mouthed than I had ever been. It also made me more vulnerable. Visiting a lake one summer, I drove to an auto-body shop and bought a rubber inner tube for $5. I inflated it, got inside and pushed off the dock. This made me near-perfectly happy.",
		"19" : "Above: A reptile of lint stirs and rears its head. Inside, the lining is black, there is no zipper, the body is swallowed whole. I think of boa constrictors, of great whites, of barrels going over Niagara Falls. And of ectoplasm.",
		"20" : "In spirit photographs from the turn of the 20th century, ectoplasm appears to be made of wool, cotton or paper. In the course of a séance, a medium would produce it from his or her mouth, nose or navel, and it would then, ideally, form the figure of a lost loved one. The spirit photographs are truly weird, and also laughable. Gobs of cheesecloth stream from the face of someone in a trance state. Ragged balls of fabric form potato-like clumps stuck to a neck.",

		"24" : "This is a persona I bring to cocktail parties. The figure I see in my head, caricatured from the inside out, trying to connect but only reflecting and being reflected. Foiling. It feels like my inability to retain what is said to me in the face of my self-absorption. Waking up in the night cringing at small talk, blurted inanities, perceived slights.",
		"25" : "But it’s like a croquembouche of exposure and erasure. As a child, I had a nightmare whenever I had a fever. In it, I was miniature, enveloped in a large mass. It was suffocating and bulbous, this mass. Sometimes I saw it as if it were part of a cartoon panel: It filled the panel and ballooned out of it. I was a speck, and then less than a speck. It was a horrible dream. Sometimes I catch corners of it, when I am near sleep, or when I am overheated. I wonder if it is about being in the womb or the birth canal. Is it prenatal, or is it about love and death, outer space and deep space, sea anemone and siren?",
		"26" : "What does Kawakubo dream?",

These come in different sizes and proportions, their silhouettes changing with the times — with the trends of idealized bodies. Is the dummy a canvas or a narrator? I wonder if, in this design, Kawakubo is writing auto-fiction, externalizing the experience of herself as a designer with her Judys.",
		"29" : "I have two Comme des Garçons dresses that I bought secondhand. One is stiff white cotton, like a nurse’s uniform but wider, with translucent strips down the sides and a Peter Pan collar. The other is ivory cotton voile with a panel of green silk velvet wrapping halfway around the belly and ending in a long, gaping seam. I wore this once to a dinner. I had been concealing my pregnancy because a subchorionic hematoma made miscarriage likely. My friend saw the dress and raised an eyebrow.",
		"30" : "My daughter is 4 now. Kawakubo’s designs remind me of my daughter’s peculiarities of dress. The sash has to be tied in the front. The trim on the sleeves can’t be blue. Seams are unbearable, and tags need to be cut out. She likes to wear the same dress every day. She doesn’t look in the mirror to see how she appears, so I think about how her choices must make her feel. Her body is not an image yet, not a projection or a pose — it’s a boundary.",
		"31" : "Above: A red couch upturned to fit through a doorway, or to barricade it. It has no arms but is not armless. It stands at attention and slouches into its pockets. Royal Guard and Charlie Chaplin.",
		"32" : "Kawakubo’s palettes are minimal and pure. A perfect strawberry red. Bubble-gum pink. Years and years of black, and deep naval, navy blue.",
		"33" : "I’ve always had a kind of synesthesia for clothes: Sweaters have to be red. Collars have to be white. Trousers, blue. My school pictures show missing teeth and variations of pigtails, but the collars are always white, the sweaters are always red.",
		"34" : "Sometimes I pull a sweater over my head and wait a moment before pushing my arms through the sleeves. I’m looking for a German word for the comfort, relief even, of not putting your arms through the armholes. It’s a form of self-soothing, generating something like the anxiety-reducing squeeze box developed by the animal scientist Temple Grandin, who has written about her autism. It calms my sensitivity.",
		"35" : "When I get out of a pool after a swim, I pull a towel over my shoulders, binding my arms to my sides at the elbow in a swaddle. Again there is this moment of blissful containment.",
		"36" : "Fashion media often insist on “What We Want Now,” a forecast of desire and perhaps the economic or political climate. But Kawakubo’s clothes erase the reality of my body within clothes. Hers remind me of innocence: not childishness, but the innocence that we have when we are 4 and we don’t know what we look like but know what we want to wear and why.",
		"37" : "My daughter wakes yelling from her afternoon nap.",
		"38" : "“Shhhh.” I wrap her up and hold her. “It’s only a nightmare.”",

		"1" : "I recently experienced the loss of a much-loved pet. I am looking into getting a new cat or cats. My dilemma is where: 1. A no-kill animal shelter; 2. A shelter that euthanizes animals if there are too many. Do I opt for the kill shelter — thereby saving lives? Or support the no-kill shelter? M. Watkin, Cobden, Ill.",
		"2" : "In your view, it’s wrong to kill a cat humanely (as we say, rather oddly) if no one wants to have it as a pet. This is a topic on which there are strong and conflicting beliefs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is highly critical of no-kill policies, given the realities of our animal shelters: Warehousing animals in cages for long periods is cruel, the group says, and the attempt to find homes for these creatures is “like bailing out a sinking ship with a teaspoon.” PETA wants us to head off the problem by sterilizing more animals, thereby reducing the number of homeless ones. Groups like the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals suggest, more diplomatically, that “no kill” is a noble aspiration but often imperfect in practice, as it results in warehousing and overcrowding. I myself have concluded that it can be O.K. to kill creatures that don’t have projects as long as you don’t cause them suffering. (Human beings, unlike other creatures, have lives they’re making whose interruption deprives them of something significant.) That’s why I am not a vegetarian but favor strong animal-welfare legislation for livestock. My aim, however, isn’t to push you toward a particular position. On these issues, there is a range of arguments to reckon with. I’d simply urge you to take the time to do so.",
		"3" : "Given your current assumptions, Options 1 and 2 each have something to be said for them. Option 1 supports an organization that won’t euthanize the animals it shelters. Option 2 means that you adopt an animal that could have been euthanized. (You might think you’d also lessen the chance that other animals will be killed, but PETA has a point about that teaspoon.) Because “adoption fees” are meant to help cover the cost of the rescue, you could give the “no-kill” shelter money and take your cat or cats from a “kill” shelter, thus achieving both goals. But do keep your eye on the larger questions of animal welfare. A “no-kill” shelter may use the money unwisely and still cause animal deaths when fatal illnesses result from overcrowding. Be sure your issues with PETA, the H.S.U.S. or the A.S.P.C.A. survive research and consideration.",

My stepsister spends most of her time with her mother, but she spends some weekends and holidays with her dad and my mom. My mother was a decent parent (I’m 22), but she has always been self-involved and insensitive. Whenever I spend time with her and my stepsister, I notice my mom acting in ways that were hurtful to me as a child. I feel I have some responsibility to protect this kid, but when I broach the topic, my mother gets very upset. Should I back off and commiserate with my stepsister when she’s old enough? Or is there a way to talk about this to my mom that will let me help the child in a more immediate way? Name Withheld",
		"5" : "Have you made it clear that what you are saying is based in your own experience? If you’ve already done so and she hasn’t changed her behavior, I’m not sure it’s worth insisting. Take consolation in the fact that your stepsister spends less time with your mother than you did (and has her own mother as well), and that you’ll be around to talk it through with her later.",
		"6" : "Our child goes to a private school that we cannot afford. A relative pays the tuition. The school offers financial aid, which we qualify for. However, our relative could, and would, pay the full fee if needed. It seems wrong to ask our relative to pay more than we are actually charged. But it also seems wrong to take aid when other families may not have this resource. The school does not ask about family resources; we are disclosing everything they ask for. What is the ethical thing to do? Name Withheld",
		"7" : "You’ve filled out the financial-aid forms correctly, you report, but you have a stream of income that the forms don’t reveal, namely the gift from your richer relative. So you’re not lying. (That’s good!) But if the school knew about this other stream, it would probably ask you for more. You’re taking advantage of what you see as a glitch in the system. (Not so good.) Given that you wouldn’t disadvantage your child if you pointed this out, the only reason not to do so is to spare your relative the extra burden. But if the financial-aid system were properly administered, you’d turn out to be undercharged. So you should tell the school that they ought to modify the forms to ask: How much assistance are you receiving from others toward school fees?",
		"8" : "My mother is from Central America. She came to the United States for college and met my American father. I am, therefore, 50 percent Latino genetically, but I don’t identify as Latino. There were (to my regret) no Central American influences in my upbringing — no Spanish language, no Latino relatives, no foods from “the old country.” There was also no discrimination directed at me or my mother (we look “white”). Is it ethical to identify as Latino in social situations and on the census? Name Withheld",
		"9" : "Our ethnic and racial categories drape loosely around the realities of our complex lives. I am the son of an English woman and a Ghanaian man. I am an American citizen. Am I a black American? African-American? Anglo-American? Anglo-African? “Latino” is a word that hovers uneasily between a category defined by culture and one defined by descent. The latter conception makes you Latino. The former doesn’t quite. There’s also a notion that ethnicity should be defined by your own sense of identity — by whether you think of yourself as Latino. But whether you think of yourself as Latino is shaped by ideas about culture and descent. There isn’t a single correct view about that. Still, here’s a solution: In cases in which you don’t have the time or space to explain your situation, probably the least confusing thing to say to people in the United States is that your mother is Latina. (As far as forms go, if they permit you to check two boxes, I’d do that. If they don’t, I don’t believe it matters much what you do.)"

		"1" : "Last May, at the height of the Democratic presidential campaign, two weeks before the California primary, Bernie Sanders flew to San Bernardino, Calif., for a meeting with leading AIDS groups. The gathering was arranged by Peter Staley, the esteemed activist and founder of the Treatment Action Group, which in the 1990s helped speed the development of antiretroviral drugs. The meeting was called to secure the Sanders campaign’s support for a spike in federal spending to combat AIDS, but as the session began, those in attendance were puzzled to find the conversation oddly strained. Sanders’s demeanor, Staley recalled, “was very wary — he was very chilly when we shook hands.” Sanders seemed to be churning internally about something until, dispensing with ceremony, he blurted out: “Let me be blunt. Do any of you get money from the drug companies?”",
		"2" : "The question was met with an awkward silence. Most AIDS organizations do accept grants from pharmaceutical companies — in some cases large ones. It is widely seen as a symbiotic relationship. AIDS nonprofits depend on funding from drug companies; drug companies depend on the organizations to educate patients about their wares. That arrangement rankled Sanders, who views the pharmaceutical industry as a public menace. In the primary, one of his signature issues was support for California’s Proposition 61, a referendum that sought to control drug prices by barring public insurers from paying any more than the prices charged to the Veterans Health Administration, which traditionally gets a big discount. A few of the AIDS activists gathered in San Bernardino — along with a number of experts and patient groups — had strong reservations about the unintended consequences of that initiative. Some worried it would drain R.&D. budgets; others feared it would prod drug companies to jack up prices on veterans. Sanders did not share their reservations about Prop. 61. “Drug companies are ripping off the American people in a big way,” he said. “These are bad-news people, and they need to be taken on.”",
		"3" : "The next day, the Sanders campaign circulated a news release about the meeting, which, to Staley’s shock, focused entirely on Sanders’s support for Prop. 61, and, in Staley’s view, gave the misleading impression that everyone present joined Sanders in endorsing the referendum. After Staley took to Facebook to dispute the account — “Feeling used and abused by the Sanders campaign right now,” he wrote to 12,000 followers — the Sanders campaign’s policy director, Warren Gunnels, attacked Staley personally on Twitter. Using scare quotes to insinuate that Staley, who once chained himself to a balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest high drug prices, didn’t really deserve to be called an “activist,” Gunnels claimed that Staley had “made a fortune from big drug companies.” As evidence, Gunnels linked to a post on a website called Stop Pharma Greed that was teeming with opposition research on some of the biggest names in AIDS activism. The post accused Staley of “shilling for big Pharma” and taking funding from companies like DuPont Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences. “In short,” the post concluded, “Staley’s livelihood since the year 2000 ... appears to have been wholly dependent on, or funded directly by, the drug industry.” Staley called the accusation a “Trumpian lie,” noting that he has lived entirely on savings for the last five years. (The tweet was later deleted.)",
		"4" : "The activists hadn’t known what to make of Sanders’s frostiness, but as soon as they saw Gunnels’s tweet, the fog lifted. Staley believed that someone had goaded the Sanders campaign into going nuclear on him, and he had no doubt about who that someone was. Stop Pharma Greed was funded by Staley’s longtime nemesis, Michael Weinstein, the 64-year-old founder and director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the world’s largest and most controversial AIDS organization. (The Sanders campaign denied Staley’s claim.) Weinstein was also the financier behind Prop. 61, which would go on to become the most expensive referendum of 2016, thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, which spent $120 million on the campaign, and eventually defeated it with 53 percent of the vote. More money was spent against Prop. 61 than was spent on behalf of any candidate for governor or Senate in 2016.",
		"5" : "Directors of health care nonprofits are traditionally cautious and courtly, fearful of choking the funding streams that issue from nit-picking grant committees and image-conscious donors. Weinstein, an ex-Trotskyite, is no courtier. He runs his organization as a “social enterprise,” meaning that it generates most of its revenue not from grants and fund-raising but from adjacent businesses. A.H.F.’s main business is a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide primary care to more than 41,000 patients in the United States, most of whom have their insurance claims paid by government insurance programs like Medicaid. The excess income from these patients helps the AIDS Healthcare Foundation provide free care to more than 700,000 H.I.V. patients internationally — the greatest reach of any AIDS organization. This prodigiously successful model has both insulated A.H.F. from typical funding woes and helped it to expand at an astonishing clip. Over the last six years, A.H.F.’s budget has grown from $300 million to more than $1.4 billion, about the size of Planned Parenthood. If their projections hold, it will reach $2 billion by 2020, giving A.H.F. — a private entity effectively under the control of one man — a budget nearly half the size of the World Health Organization’s.",
		"6" : "Paradoxically, that projected growth depends in part on whether drug costs remain high. While cutting drug prices is an ideological objective for Weinstein, his pharmacies stand to lose revenue should he succeed in that mission. “Most of the time when people benefit from something, they don’t lobby against it,” he told me recently. “But we’re Robin Hood. If someone was writing an epitaph for this organization some day, it will be: ‘Bit the hand that fed it.’ ”",
		"7" : "A.H.F.’s rapid ascent has made Weinstein an object of scorn among his peers, who deplore not only his tactics but also his unorthodox positions on public-health issues. Unlike nearly all other AIDS activists and public-health researchers, Weinstein opposes PrEP, the H.I.V.-prevention pill, which he believes will cause a “public-health catastrophe” by triggering a dangerous increase in risky sex. He has also campaigned to make condoms mandatory in adult films, even going so far as to introduce a statewide referendum in California, Proposition 60. Weinstein’s positions have been assailed by peers as counterproductive fearmongering. “It reminds me very much of the Tea Party people with regard to Obamacare,” Ernest Hopkins, director of legislative affairs for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me in 2013, referring to Weinstein’s opposition to PrEP. “If you’re prepared to say whatever you want and lie and demagogue and misrepresent the facts, then you can get a lot of airtime, and you can also persuade a lot of people.”",
		"8" : "To his many critics in AIDS activism, Weinstein is the Koch brothers of public health: a mastermind driven by ideology, accountable to no one, with bottomless funds and an agenda marked by financial opportunism and puritanical extremes. It doesn’t help that A.H.F. has been the subject of near-constant litigation and complaints for questionable business practices, including union-busting, giving kickbacks to patients, overbilling government insurers and bullying funders into denying grants to institutional rivals. (A.H.F. has denied these accusations.)",
		"9" : "To his faithful, however, Weinstein is not only a provider of superior health care but also an evangelist of moral urgency at a time when prevention efforts are floundering and drug prices are surging. Weinstein seems to view himself in loftier terms, as a holy warrior sent to save the innocent, not only from the scourge of H.I.V. but also from those he views as the virus’s human collaborators: a satanic trifecta of greedy executives, vainglorious activists and incompetent bureaucrats.",
		"10" : "Weinstein’s office, a cold and tidy room overlooking the Hollywood Hills, is an archive of sentimental zealotry. On his desk, an outward-facing plaque greets visitors with a defiant warning attributed to Hannibal — “I shall either find a way or make one,” a reference to herding war elephants over the Alps to destroy Rome. On one wall, a framed resolution from the California State Legislature honoring Weinstein for his community service hangs incongruously beside an orphaned sheet of paper printed with a Harry Truman-ism: “It’s amazing what you can accomplish when you do not care who gets the credit.” Above the Truman quotation, there’s a photo of Weinstein in front of the Taj Mahal, sitting alone in a red shirt; there are no photos of Weinstein’s husband, a Vietnamese immigrant who owns a nail salon. A second piece of Scotch-taped paper bears an aphorism of Weinstein’s own coinage: “Help Defeat Self-Imposed Helplessness.”",
		"11" : "The first time I visited, in February of last year, Weinstein invited me to sit down without shaking my hand. A lean man with a long forehead, bird-of-prey features and a nerdy, pocket-protector vibe, Weinstein had a formal demeanor but was wearing jeans and a hoodie — a common outfit for a tech leader but unusual for a health care magnate. Weinstein took me on an abbreviated tour, proudly showing off photos he had taken with celebrities and political figures — Magic Johnson, Alicia Keys, former Senator Tom Harkin. Above his desk hung an Expressionist portrait of his best friend, with whom he founded A.H.F., Chris Brownlie. By all accounts, Brownlie was the softhearted yin to Weinstein’s gladiatorial yang, as charming and consensus-seeking as Weinstein was splenetic and introverted. Brownlie died from AIDS-related complications in 1989.",
		"12" : "Weinstein has a long history of militancy. Born in Brooklyn’s Bensonhurst neighborhood to a family of left-wing Jews, at age 13 he volunteered for an antiwar congressional candidate and worked as an equipment mule for his filmmaker sister, toting around a 40-pound battery while she shot footage of protesters burning draft cards in Central Park. The next year, he joined a group of activists occupying a new high-rise development to protest what was not yet known as gentrification. Though he realized he was gay early on, he repressed his sexuality for many years, eventually moving in with an older girlfriend. At age 18, he had his first gay encounter with an upstairs neighbor, also officially straight, who knocked on his door one night when both of their girlfriends were out of town.",
		"13" : "In 1972, when Weinstein was 19, he traveled to California and joined Los Angeles’s gay activism scene. An outsider among both mainstream gays (for being a Marxist) and Marxists (for being gay), Weinstein decided to start his own group, which he called the Lavender and Red Union. The group eventually merged with a gay-friendly Trotskyite organization in New York called the Spartacist League, which offered Weinstein a leadership position, requiring him to move back to the East Coast. He wasn’t at his new post for long, though, before he fell out with his comrades over an unusual matter: the Roman Polanski sexual-abuse case, in which the director was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. “They felt that it was not rape, that the girl knew what she was doing,” Weinstein’s boyfriend at the time, Albert Ruiz, told me. Weinstein believed it was rape and felt strongly enough about the matter, among other disputes, that he resigned.",
		"14" : "Disillusioned with activism, Weinstein briefly ran a candy business in Los Angeles before returning to politics to face an unlikely antagonist. In 1986, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche introduced a ballot referendum in California that would have enabled employers to fire people with AIDS and empowered the government to quarantine them. Early polling suggested that LaRouche’s initiative had broad support. Along with Brownlie and other friends, Weinstein started his own group to fight LaRouche’s proposition. In a move that anticipated his later shock-marketing campaigns, Weinstein distributed leaflets with the headline “STOP AIDS CONCENTRATION CAMPS” and organized a torch-lit march on LaRouche’s Silver Lake office. Mainstream gay activists abhorred Weinstein’s strong-arm tactics, fearing he might alienate suburban voters. But after the measure lost in a landslide, with 71 percent opposed, L.A. Weekly named Weinstein “Best Young Activist.” Weinstein determined that there was far greater support for his militant approach than he had realized.",
		"15" : "As the AIDS crisis intensified, Weinstein watched more and more of his friends grow ill and die. Los Angeles County hospital had barely developed procedures for handling dying AIDS patients, and many were left to expire alone on gurneys in crowded hallways. Doctors and nurses would often refuse to care for AIDS sufferers, and when the untreated patients died, undertakers often turned them away, too. In some parts of the country, the deceased ended up in garbage bags delivered directly to crematories. Weinstein wanted to ensure that AIDS patients could die in a respectful, peaceful atmosphere. In 1989, he and Brownlie founded the precursor of A.H.F. — the AIDS Hospice Foundation. In 1990, as more AIDS medications became available, Weinstein changed the group’s name to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and shifted its focus to medical care for the living. In the late ’90s, little by little, A.H.F. expanded from Southern California into Florida and New York. Then, in 2000, A.H.F. made a change that would prove crucial to its business model: It opened its first pharmacy.",
		"16" : "Pharmacy services are, in Weinstein’s words, A.H.F.’s “jet fuel.” That’s because 70 percent of spending on H.I.V. care consists of drug costs. While H.I.V. patients in the United States skew poor, the costly insurance claims they generate by filling prescriptions make them gold mines, not only for pharmaceutical companies but also for certain pharmacies, like Weinstein’s, that take advantage of a federal program called 340B. Passed in 1991, 340B allows pharmacies attached to medical practices serving underprivileged populations to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at, on average, a 35 percent discount but still be reimbursed by insurers for 100 percent of the wholesale price. In effect, 340B allows pharmacies to keep around 35 percent of the pharmaceutical industry’s tab, a roundabout way of subsidizing health care for the poor. As the price of AIDS medications has spiraled upward in recent years, A.H.F.’s coffers have swelled. The cost of the latest first-line H.I.V. treatment — a combination pill from Gilead called Genvoya — is about $34,000 per patient per year. When a patient uses an A.H.F. pharmacy, about $22,000 of that bill goes to Gilead, and $12,000 goes to A.H.F. The foundation’s pharmacies serve 50,000 patients in the United States, generating approximately $1 billion each year in revenue — about $200 million of it surplus. That money subsidizes A.H.F.’s expansion and advocacy as well as the group’s political activities.",
		"17" : "The pool of potential patients for an organization like A.H.F. is oceanic. In 2014, 37,600 Americans were newly infected with H.I.V. That number has declined only slightly over the last decade, as America’s epidemic has settled into a baleful equilibrium of slow growth and rising costs. The lack of progress is especially disheartening considering that H.I.V. medications, when properly administered, render patients almost totally noninfectious. These medications aren’t new — they’ve existed for two decades. If every infected American took them, our epidemic would be over. Instead, of the roughly 1.2 million Americans with H.I.V., only 40 percent are on medication, a rate lower than South Africa’s. Weinstein believes that America’s AIDS nonprofits, which he refers to derisively as “AIDS Inc.” — a label meant to evoke sclerotic incumbents who collect renewable grants and stand only for their own perpetuation — have been useless in the face of the epidemic. To win, he thinks, “AIDS Inc.” has to be sidelined so that A.H.F. can lead the way.",
		"18" : "Last spring, Weinstein summoned 30 foot soldiers to the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans for a retreat for A.H.F.’s sales team — a division that doesn’t exist at most nonprofits because most nonprofits have nothing to sell. A.H.F. does: It sells health care to a customer base overwhelmingly composed of patients receiving government assistance, and each new patient it acquires means more cash for its operations. The sales team at A.H.F. is responsible for recruiting new patients, a function they perform by scouring homeless shelters, hosting parties at gay clubs, cozying up to local clinicians and deploying mobile-testing vans to H.I.V. hot spots. It’s a commissions-driven gig. For each new patient who goes to an A.H.F. clinic and fills an antiretroviral prescription at an A.H.F. pharmacy, the rep receives $300. He or she receives an additional $300 when patients fill their prescriptions a second time — the second fill being a more reliable predictor of patient retention.",
		"19" : "To recruit new patients, sales reps are expected to hold several events each month, most of them in high-risk zones. Events vary by location. On Los Angeles’s Skid Row, for example, reps hand out McDonald’s gift cards to anyone willing to take a rapid H.I.V. test. In South Central, the reps sometimes set up a game called Cash Box, in which contestants who agree to a rapid test enter a plexiglass booth where they try to grab cash as it is blown around at high speeds. In gay neighborhoods, reps may invite passers-by to play Dildo Toss — a carny-inspired game in which players hurl phalluses of varying colors and sizes into a hole carved out of a plank of wood. “We give them three chances,” explained Edwin Millan, director of sales for the Western United States, “and if it goes in the hole, they get to spin a wheel and they get a prize.” (In 2015, two former employees filed a whistle-blower suit arguing that A.H.F.’s patient incentives amounted to illegal kickbacks; the lawsuit has not yet reached a resolution, and A.H.F. denies the claims.) In addition to seeking out patients directly, sales reps also cultivate referral sources by hosting lunches for area doctors.",
		"20" : "The retreat’s kickoff dinner was held in the French Quarter, at Deanie’s Seafood. Tucked away in a back room, the gregarious sales reps kibitzed noisily, slurping crawfish étouffée as Weinstein, seated at the head of a long table, examined his battalion. Like other divisions at A.H.F., this group was anchored by black women in floral prints and gay men of all races in checkered shirts; many were new hires Weinstein was meeting for the first time. “Sometimes I have to pinch myself,” Weinstein whispered to me, marveling at how swiftly his organization had expanded.",
		"21" : "As the sales reps emptied their plates and hailed waiters for second and third rounds of wine, Weinstein tapped his glass with a fork and called the group to attention. “I’d like to officially welcome you to the Big Easy!” he squawked in his blunt Brooklynese. “Do whatever you want as long as you wake up in the morning.” The reps laughed. “You know, this is a really powerful force on behalf of the organization — a powerful force on behalf of the growth. Going out there, pounding the pavement, going after new accounts and clients — you have to be immune to rejection to be successful, and that’s not easy. I’m pretty bad at it myself!” He wasn’t kidding. Weinstein belies the cliché that the best fighters develop a thick skin: He has sustained himself through decades of conflict by salting unhealed wounds, nursing unceasing resentment and preserving grudges in amber.",
		"22" : "The morning after the dinner, the sales reps reconvened in a dreary conference room with red tablecloths and damask carpeting. Programming for the first day called for an icebreaker in which employees were asked to scribble unusual facts about themselves on pieces of paper tossed into a hat. One man, a bodybuilder from South Beach with silver hair and pumpkin-colored skin, wrote that he used to train with Madonna; a copper-haired woman from San Francisco disclosed that she swam through garbage during an initiation ritual for Semester at Sea. Weinstein’s own fact, the one he always uses for such exercises, was that he dropped out of high school.",
		"23" : "The icebreaker was followed by an exercise intended to explore how to navigate conversations with A.H.F.’s critics. Weinstein gave volunteers the option of representing the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, leaders of which have been vocally critical of A.H.F., or a “PrEP crazy,” someone incensed by Weinstein’s opposition to the H.I.V.-prevention pill. Another volunteer would play A.H.F.",
		"24" : "“I’ll be S.F.A.F.!” volunteered the copper-haired woman. Her counterpart was a man whose upper lip was adorned with a sumptuous mustache.",
		"25" : "“I’m here to talk to you about the services that we provide,” he began.",
		"26" : "“I know all about A.H.F., actually,” replied the copper-haired woman, her eyes narrowing. “Your reputation precedes you.”",
		"27" : "“O.K., awesome. Did you know that we started the first AIDS hospice in Los Angeles about 28 years ago?” he asked. “Since then, we’ve grown rapidly, primarily overseas.”",
		"28" : "“I know you’ve grown rapidly,” she snapped, summoning a glower. “You’re the Walmart of H.I.V.” She went on: “I’ve been in the H.I.V. field for 30 years! I’ve lived through the epidemic; I’ve seen all my friends die. You guys advertise yourselves as this ‘not-for-profit.’ I know the true thing: You guys are a huge profit source. I can’t even find your financials on your website — you hide those.”",
		"29" : "The reps laughed; they’d all heard some version of this tirade a thousand times. Weinstein took the floor and concluded the session by telling a little story about a nun he once met. She ran a hospital, which required her to make tough budgetary decisions in the name of helping people. Whenever people criticized her for being harsh, she had a canned response: “No margin, no mission!” This, according to Weinstein, is what A.H.F.’s critics couldn’t bring themselves to understand. “We should never be in a position of apologizing for our success,” he said. “The fact that we take a business model from the private sector and utilize it on behalf of a nonprofit is a great thing.”",
		"30" : "This saintly narrative is complicated by the fact that Weinstein has drawn from his plentiful war chest to underwrite a dizzying number of controversial projects, some of which seem only tenuously connected to his core mission. In addition to the drug-pricing initiative and the condoms-in-porn bill, he filed a lawsuit against Gilead Sciences, the leading manufacturer of AIDS drugs, for patent manipulation (Gilead prevailed in court; A.H.F. has filed an appeal). He led a petition drive in Mississippi to remove Confederate symbols from the state flag, and he funded an anti-density campaign in Los Angeles that sought to halt construction on most new residential towers for two years, including a 28-story project across the street from Weinstein’s global headquarters.",
		"31" : "And then there are the billboards. In major American cities — and increasingly, around the world — Weinstein’s most visible impact is his trolling approach to sexual-health messaging. In 2013, he put up signs in several cities with the image of a magma-spewing volcano captioned, “SYPHILIS EXPLOSION.” The following year, in South Central, he posted billboards with two black men spooning in bed alongside the leading question “Trust Him?” Some ads have been humorous and topical — a sendup of the Netflix logo replaced with the mantra “Get Tested and Chill,” a Bernie Sanders parody with the modified slogan “Feel the Burn?” Others have hectored the public with reproachful questions: “Friends With Benefits?” “Sexually Reckless?” “Worried?” One A.H.F. billboard managed to cause a national scandal in Uganda. Unusually for a nonprofit, A.H.F. employs a 15-person in-house creative agency to create its messaging. The expense is justified because the billboards are a marketing channel: They seek to stir dread in the libertine masses, not only to stem what Weinstein sees as a rising tide of promiscuity but also to drive traffic to his clinics.",
		"32" : "In the press, Weinstein has attracted the most attention for his hostility to PrEP, a once-a-day antiretroviral that reduces the likelihood of contracting H.I.V. by 99 percent. In 2015, the C.D.C. began recommending PrEP for anyone at “high risk” for H.I.V. infection, including any gay man not in a monogamous relationship who has had sex in the last six months without a condom (1.2 million people, according to the C.D.C.’s estimates). Many hailed it as an era-defining advance. Weinstein, virtually alone among major AIDS figures, has assailed PrEP, calling it a “party drug” that could lead to a collapse in condom use. In a citizen petition to the Food and Drug Administration following PrEP’s approval in 2012, A.H.F.’s lawyer denounced the treatment as “unsafe and ineffective.” Weinstein called on Margaret Hamburg, the agency’s commissioner, to resign over the issue, suggesting she was part of a pharma-led plot to put millions of Americans on a new medication.",
		"33" : "Weinstein’s critique of PrEP is a fringe view. According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, support for PrEP among researchers and regulators is all but universal. “It’s having an extraordinarily positive impact,” he says. Robert Grant, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and a leading PrEP researcher, credits the treatment with “a plummeting decline” in H.I.V. transmission rates among white gay men in San Francisco.",
		"34" : "Nevertheless, Weinstein is quoted regularly in articles about the treatment, and his noisy skepticism has reverberated across the internet. Some argue that Weinstein’s grandstanding during public hearings delayed PrEP’s approval by the C.D.C., and that his sowing of doubt about the medication is continuing to suppress its use, especially in black and Latino communities. “What I find in my practice,” Grant says, “is that A.H.F.’s propaganda does not impress or influence privileged groups of gay men. They can see right through it. But when I talk to some people of color who are clients in my clinics, I find they’ve heard the A.H.F. message, and it gives them pause, it makes them concerned, it appeals to their sense that this isn’t for them.” Despite the C.D.C.’s efforts, very few people, even now, are on PrEP; according to recent estimates, only about 100,000 people take it.",
		"35" : "Weinstein’s concerns about PrEP are in line with his other heterodox positions, which often cut against the sexual-liberationist doctrine embraced by other activists. Many issues that have been controversial in the gay community, he claims, like laws that make it illegal to intentionally infect a sexual partner with H.I.V., are no-brainers for ordinary voters. “Some people are so extreme,” he told me. “There’s a group here in California that wants to reduce intentionally infecting somebody from a felony to a misdemeanor. There’s articles being written basically saying we should be proud to bareback” — slang for condomless sex. “In the hothouse environment of the gay community, that point of view is very popular, but it isn’t in the community at large, and it isn’t in the medical community either.”",
		"36" : "What motivates Weinstein to adopt such lonely views? Weinstein’s fiercest critics have often searched for a financial motive, some even going so far as to suggest that he aims to profit from the spread of H.I.V. Those who know him personally dismiss this explanation. Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute, first met Weinstein in 1980 when Wilson was dating Chris Brownlie. In fact, the first iteration of A.H.F. was founded in Wilson’s living room. “This is the mistake that people make when they think about Michael,” Wilson told me. “Whether what he does is good or bad, he does what he believes is in the best interests of people living with H.I.V. or at risk of infection.” Weinstein was “primarily driven by mission,” Wilson said. Even Peter Staley concedes that point. “I don’t think it’s about the money for him,” he told me, unsurprised to learn that in Weinstein’s most recent annual report, he disclosed a comparatively humble salary of $400,000, low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits. “The core of the business at A.H.F. is not something that has been scandalous,” Staley says. “It is an empire worth building. A.H.F.’s problem is that once it created the largest AIDS empire on the planet, it started using that power for nefarious purposes: Michael Weinstein’s twisted political views.”",
		"37" : "On paper, 2016 was Weinstein’s best year ever. He opened six new pharmacies and one clinic in the United States and started new programs in Indonesia, Bolivia and Zimbabwe. But on the advocacy side, he suffered significant setbacks. In November, his drug-pricing initiative failed. So did his condoms-in-porn initiative, despite the fact that he had managed to pass a similar law in Los Angeles County in 2012. Most recently, on March 7, voters in the city of Los Angeles resoundingly rejected, by a 2-to-1 margin, his quixotic anti-density measure. The public, it seems, is not on board with Weinstein’s agenda.",
		"38" : "Even so, when I visited Weinstein at his office in February, he showed no sign of disappointment. Discussing recent losses, he wasn’t merely philosophical; he was downright giddy. “I had never been involved with a campaign,” he said, referring to the drug-pricing initiative, “where people were so enthusiastic about something that didn’t win.” (He would later use the same line with reporters when his anti-density ordinance went down in flames.) As we chatted, he sipped from a radioactive-looking bottle of apple-melon Isopure; he said he liked his chances for this November, when he would try again with a new drug-pricing initiative, this time in Ohio. The problem in California, he said, was that the drug companies had flooded the airwaves — “total aerial bombardment, 3,500 gross rating points a week” — but he doubted that kind of “razzmatazz” would work in flyover country. “Midwesterners are kind of square-shouldered, common-sense people. I’d think there’d be a backlash if they dumped $80 million into Ohio.”",
		"39" : "If that referendum were to pass, Weinstein figured, then Big Pharma’s citadel — the American market — would start to crack. Ohio would be copied by other states, and the V.A.’s price for drugs would become the universal price, as even private insurers would demand to pay the new public rate. Billions would be shaved off pharma’s bottom line, meaning the industry would no longer have the muscle to bully Congress into propping up its international patent regime. Drug prices would plummet across the world, AIDS medications would flow freely and the industry’s lobbying operation would shrink so much that it could be drowned in a bathtub. This sequence of events seemed far-fetched, but Weinstein was nevertheless optimistic about the coming year, win or lose. His equanimity in the face of failure reminded me of something he once said to me about Prop. 60, the condoms-in-porn bill. It lost at the ballot box by an eight-point margin, but Weinstein found a reason to declare victory. “We’ve had more than 10,000 stories on condoms in porn,” he boasted. “Forget about porn: That’s a lot of free advertising for condoms.”",
		"40" : "Weinstein often consoles himself in moments of defeat by reaffirming his commitment to the long game. This is part of what makes him so frustrating to his critics: It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to distinguish his cynical ploys from his ideological commitments. In his person, the will to power and the will to change the world seem to fuse. It wasn’t simply that he cared more about fighting than about winning. Eventually, he believes, people will come around to his view. And if they don’t, that’s fine, too: A.H.F. will continue to thrive, even in a fallen world."

		"1" : "Your company, theSkimm, is known for a daily news digest targeted toward millennial women, which is read by over five million people. Its tagline is “theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter.” What does that mean? ZAKIN: We didn’t create theSkimm for lack of intelligence or lack of interest in the news. What we figured out was a way to make it easier for our readers to understand the world around them in a way that they enjoyed hearing about and in a way that made it easy to remember.",
		"2" : "A recent newsletter used “when you and your friend both thought the other was making dinner reservations” as a way to introduce the confusion over a U.S. aircraft carrier that was supposed to be headed to North Korea. Why does the newsletter have the tone it does? WEISBERG: We sound like people actually speak. We spent a lot of time developing the character of the Skimm Girl. When we bring people onto our team, no matter if they’re an engineer or on products, we talk about who this character is, and what she would order at brunch, or what her favorite drink is.",
		"3" : "What is her favorite drink? ZAKIN: A jalapeño margarita.",
		"4" : "Do you think the chatty aspect trivializes the news? ZAKIN: You don’t get topics that have more gravity than the ones we’re talking about now, and the fact that people still read the news and enjoy the experience says a lot about the community we’ve created.",
		"5" : "Do you think digests make people feel more informed than they actually are? WEISBERG: We would love it if everyone was as obsessed with the news as we are, but that’s not the reality, and it never will be. We’re proud to be a gateway drug.",
		"6" : "Why have you remained nonpartisan? ZAKIN: We didn’t feel it was our place to endorse a candidate. We pushed our audience to make sure that they were informed, but we wanted them to make their own opinion. Last year, we worked with Rock the Vote and got over 110,000 people registered to vote, 95,000 of which were women. That’s something we’re hugely proud of: that this audience isn’t just reading us every day, but they’re also taking some sort of action.",

		"8" : "How do you decide what to cover? ZAKIN: Our goal is that anyone who goes to any work or social event can talk to anybody about anything. We’re not putting a value proposition on what stories you should care about most, but what we are saying is that this is the stuff you’re going to hear about. WEISBERG: I think the other way that editorial filter really comes into play is the way we work with brands. That part of our business is driven by native advertising, so we work with brands that we feel can connect with our audience. Ultimately, we think about ourselves as storytellers, whether it’s telling the news of the day, telling the company story or telling the brand story.",
		"9" : "You started your careers in news at NBC. Do you have any discomfort about working with brands from that? WEISBERG: Considering ourselves journalists doesn’t mean that we can’t consider ourselves businesswomen.",
		"10" : "Considering the chattiness of your tone, are you conscious of the need to negotiate gender stereotypes? WEISBERG: Well, as businesswomen who quit our jobs to start a company from a couch and have raised through Series B venture funding and employ 40 people, Carly and I are certainly doing a lot for the narrative of female entrepreneurship. ZAKIN: If we can empower people to feel more comfortable talking about Syria while they’re having a glass of sauvignon blanc, then we’re happy to celebrate that."

About a half-dozen butchers worked, all wearing white coats.",

		"1" : "The wood anemone is one of spring’s ephemeral joys, and is often the first bit of green to greet hikers in the late winter woods.",
		"2" : "Though each plant is diminutive, it is connected to an ever-widening colony of plants that seems to bubble up effervescently through a carpet of tired old oak leaves. These dense, almost circular colonies may eventually reach 10 to 12 feet in diameter, and can be composed of hundreds of individual stems. When each plant attains a height of about three to six inches, it produces a striking white or pinkish flower that seems to magically hover over the dark green leaves.",
		"3" : "From a distance, staring at hundreds of these starry flowers is akin to looking at a galaxy in microcosm, each one sparkling above a dark woodland universe.",
		"4" : "Still, the beauty of these blooms is best appreciated nose to the ground — perhaps it is some faint aroma that is absolutely irresistible to early season insect pollinators. The truth is, any extra appeal is probably unnecessary; as lovely as wood anemones are, there is just not that much competition in the early spring woods.",
		"5" : "Lovers of the botanically arcane may find it surprising that the beautiful wood anemone has only three leaves and not five, as its Latin name — Anemone quinquefolia — would suggest. But no matter how dissected and divided each leaf appears, the flower has only three leaves atop each stem.",
		"6" : "The genus name, anemone, is most likely derived from the Greek word for wind, anemos, and is the source of one of the plant’s most colorful common names: windflower. This breezy association is apparent to anyone patient enough to sit alongside a patch for a quiet minute or two.",
		"7" : "Supported on thin stems, these graceful flowers are animated by the slightest woodland breeze. Even visiting pollinators set the blooms trembling as they work their way through the tiny cosmos. It is easy to imagine all of this glorious abundance from a bee’s-eye perspective. Slowing hurried humans enough to appreciate this brief but lavish moment in the woodland’s spring may be the anemone’s most significant gift to admirers.",
		"8" : "One of the best locations to appreciate this lovely early season bloom is Cunningham Park in Queens, where several colonies can be viewed directly from the trail side. Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx also provides opportunities for viewing this spring ephemeral, as do several Staten Island woodlands.",
		"9" : "Like all spring ephemerals, the clock is always ticking for the wood anemone. Tree leaves are expanding above the fragile wildflowers, and each day less and less light pokes through the canopy. By mid-June, the wood anemone and its springtime companions, like trout lily or bloodroot, have celebrated their brief moment in the sun. Some anemone plants may persist a bit longer, but most fade and are not seen again until the following spring. If the colony has been successful, it will spread a little wider next year, and may even produce a few seeds to colonize more distant corners of the woods."

Given the combination of high prices and strict mortgage requirements, “the low mortgage interest rates,” it said, are “merely an optical illusion for many households.”",
		"10" : "Recently, however, the rise in home prices has begun to slow nationwide.

		"12" : "Around Lake Geneva, real estate prices shot up after 2008, when multinationals brought jobs to the area and created a demand for housing, said Fabien Risse, a manager of SPG Finest Properties, an agency based in Switzerland and a Christie’s affiliate. But since 2012, house prices there have dropped an average of 20 percent, he said, and apartment prices an average of 15 percent.",
		"13" : "The luxury market around Lake Geneva has seen an even steeper drop, of 20 to 30 percent, since 2012, Ms. Chabloz said, noting that her company defines that category as homes priced at more than 4 million Swiss francs.",
		"14" : "Prices, of course, vary significantly by region, Mr. Risse said. Luxury apartments can go for around 11,000 Swiss francs a square meter (or about $1,022 a square foot) in Lausanne and double that in Gstaad; in Geneva, luxury apartments cost around 15,000 Swiss francs a square meter (or $1,394 a square foot), he said.",
		"15" : "Near Lake Geneva and Lake Zurich, prime apartments can cost between 13,000 and 20,000 Swiss francs a square meter (or between $1,207 and $1,858 a square foot), Ms. Chabloz said.",
		"16" : "WHO BUYS IN SWITZERLAND",
		"17" : "Foreign luxury buyers come from European Union countries like France, Britain, Germany and Belgium, Mr. Risse said, or the United States, Canada or Russia.",
		"18" : "But foreigners are in the minority, Ms. Chabloz said; at her agency, 85 percent of home buyers last year were Swiss. And the number of Russian buyers, she added, has decreased sharply.",
		"19" : "BUYING BASICS",
		"20" : "Switzerland imposes stringent federal restrictions on foreign home buyers. In addition, each of the country’s 26 cantons, or states, has its own rules on foreign homeownership (and its own taxes and notary fees).",
		"21" : "The seller typically pays the real estate agent’s commission, which is usually 3 percent of the purchase price, said Cécile Berger Meyer, a partner with Lenz & Staehelin, a Geneva-based law firm. The buyer pays the registration tax on the transfer of ownership, as well as any notary and land registry fees. The buyer also pays for legal and land surveying services.",
		"22" : "In Vaud, Ms. Berger Meyer said, the buyer’s closing costs on a 5 million Swiss franc property with a 4 million Swiss franc mortgage would be about 205,544 Swiss francs, including survey costs and legal fees.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Tucked away, cared for and durable are qualities associated with Our Lady of Mount Carmel Grotto, a stone-studded shrine on a dead-end street on Staten Island that volunteers have expanded, little by little, since the Great Depression.",
		"2" : "But those descriptions could also apply to its surrounding neighborhood, Rosebank, a low-key and largely Italian community that for generations seemed to stay remarkably intact.",
		"3" : "Cracks, however, are showing. Willy-nilly development has jammed clumps of townhouses on tiny lots, critics say, ruining blocks and worsening congestion, even if that development is perfectly legal. And projects that are much larger, with even greater potential to alter the landscape, are coming.",
		"4" : "“We really need a timeout on development,” said Michael DeCataldo, 69, a third-generation Rosebank resident and a retired sanitation worker. “We’re not like Brooklyn and Manhattan that have major thoroughfares going through.”",
		"5" : "Mr. DeCataldo inherited his rowhouse-style home from his father, who was also raised there, by Mr. DeCataldo’s grandfather, an Italian immigrant.",
		"6" : "And while the two-family property may have basically been free, it could probably fetch as much as $500,000, according to Mr. DeCataldo, who lives in the downstairs unit with his wife, Ellen DeCataldo, while their grandson, Vinnie DiSimone, 21, lives upstairs.",
		"7" : "If a developer came knocking, the temptation to sell could be great. But knowing that it might be bulldozed, “I could never sell,” Mr. DeCataldo said.",
		"8" : "Other changes seem inevitable. Since 2010, Rosebank’s two Roman Catholic schools have closed, and in 2015, so did St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church, a red-brick structure on a high-profile hill that developers may target next, according to residents.",
		"9" : "And major projects are planned, including a three-tower complex with up to 400 apartments on a waterfront site along industrial Edgewater Street.",
		"10" : "Staten Island’s Community Board 1, which approved the plan this past winter, nevertheless demanded that its towers be shorter than the 12 or 13 stories originally proposed, officials say. V Capital Management, the developer, did not return calls requesting comment on the project, which still requires zoning approval.",
		"11" : "Similarly, a dense 72-unit complex from Frank McErlean, a developer, is proposed for a grassy lot at the end of Scarboro Avenue. He also did not return calls for comment.",
		"12" : "“We’re on an uptick because of the wheel,” said John Guzzo, 58, a longtime resident and a community board official, referring to the supersized Ferris wheel and shopping district rising in nearby St. George.",
		"13" : "But new housing needs new sewers, streetlights and phone lines, which have so far been slow to materialize, said Mr. Guzzo. He is moving out of his current house, which is too large for his needs, but going just around the corner. “It is only over when you give up,” he said, “and we still have hope.”",
		"14" : "Three of Rosebank’s borders are not really in dispute: Interstate 278, the Staten Island Railway tracks and New York Bay. But while some residents say Rosebank, in northeastern Staten Island, should encompass parts of Shore Acres, a more affluent area to the south, the Staten Island Board of Realtors puts the cutoff at St. Johns Avenue.",
		"15" : "Most houses are three stories or shorter, and stand close to their neighbors even if they are detached. The houses, often in a flat-roofed Italianate style, also hug their sidewalks, which may explain why Rosebank feels so close-knit.",
		"16" : "In a place where extended families sometimes live under the same roof, including some in growing Asian and Hispanic populations, inventory is limited. Brokers say another factor is that builders snap up older properties the second they hit the market, to tear down and replace with townhouses.",
		"17" : "Scattered throughout are brick 1960s-era ranches and, of course, those townhouses, in stucco and beige-brick finishes. Condos are also rare, though 31 Hylan Boulevard, a high-rise from the 1980s with a heated outdoor pool, offers 14 floors of units.",
		"18" : "Values have mostly been improving. In the first quarter of 2015, 13 properties sold, mostly single-family houses, at an average price of $335,000, according to the Board of Realtors, while in the first quarter of 2016, 23 sold at an average of $358,000.",
		"19" : "But in the first quarter of 2017, the board said, just nine residences sold, and at an average of $305,000.",
		"20" : "One-bedroom rentals were available in late April for about $1,100 a month, according to HotPads, a listing service, while two-bedrooms were about $1,500.",
		"21" : "The annual party at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Grotto, which has taken place almost every year since 1903, kicks off its eight-day run on Amity Street on July 13. Musical entertainment at the grotto, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, will include an Elvis impersonator.",
		"22" : "An infusion of eclectic restaurants has brightened the somewhat ragged Bay Street corridor in recent years. They include Korzo Klub, with an Eastern European focus; the Phunky Elephant, a gastro pub; and Bin 5, considered one of Staten Island’s top places to eat.",
		"23" : "The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum, a gabled house where an Italian war hero, Giuseppe Garibaldi, lived in the 1850s, offers a 12-week Italian-language course. Nonmembers pay $175.",
		"24" : "Another glimpse of the distant past can be had at the gingerbread-trimmed house of the photographer Alice Austen, where Hylan Boulevard meets the sea. Today, it’s a city park ringed with a picket fence. Through fog on a recent morning, the only bit of Manhattan that was visible was 1 World Trade Center’s upper floors.",
		"25" : "Public School 13, at Hylan Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, offers prekindergarten to fifth-grade instruction to about 850 students. On state exams for the 2015-16 school year, 37 percent of students met state standards in English, compared with 39 percent citywide, while 43 percent met standards in math, versus 40 percent citywide.",
		"26" : "Intermediate School 49, also known as the Berta A. Dreyfus School, enrolls about 775 students in sixth through eighth grades. On the 2015-16 state exams, 20 percent of students met state standards in English, versus 37 percent citywide, and 10 percent met standards in math, compared with 32 percent citywide.",
		"27" : "Many students head to New Dorp High School, where in 2016, the average SAT scores were 448 in reading, 455 in math and 442 in writing, compared with 446, 466 and 440 citywide.",
		"28" : "Though the Staten Island Railway does not stop in Rosebank, the bus lines S51, S81 and S52 run to the ferry terminal in St. George, where boats leave for Lower Manhattan every 15 minutes during rush hour. Bus fares are a MetroCard swipe; ferries are free. Total travel time is about an hour.",
		"29" : "And many in Rosebank drive to other boroughs via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is close.",
		"30" : "During World War II, an area on the edge of Rosebank was a prisoner-of-war camp for Italian soldiers, according to “Discovering Staten Island: A 350th Anniversary Commemorative History” (History Press, 2011). Today, the site, which was also a filming location for the 1915 silent movie “The Birth of a Nation,” according to the book, is home to the 17-acre Eibs Pond Park, a wetland preserve."

An Oscar winner for a pair of Woody Allen films, “Hannah and Her Sisters” and “Bullets Over Broadway,” Ms. Wiest earned admiring reviews when she undertook the formidable Beckett role last spring in New Haven. “Another heavenly day,” the immobilized Winnie says as the play begins.

		"1" : "The day of a recent school shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the superintendent of the local school district offered parents guidance on how to talk with their children about the incident, in which a teacher, an 8-year-old student and the gunman all died.",
		"2" : "“Be willing to listen to their story and be willing to listen to their story multiple times,” the superintendent said. “Reassure them that the danger that they faced has passed.”",
		"3" : "It was kind and sensible advice, and if I hadn’t read it in a news story on my way home from seeing “Church & State,” an Off Broadway play that takes forceful exception to the pervasive gun violence in the United States, the words might not have struck me the way they did. As it was, I couldn’t help thinking that the broader danger had not at all passed, and that there’s no assuaging the generalized dread that courses through our culture with every fresh headline-grabbing slaughter, and in between.",
		"4" : "“I for one am tired of being afraid,” a Southern senator says in the play, reversing his stance on gun control after a massacre at his children’s school.",
		"5" : "On stage after stage lately, playwrights have been confronting such fears about gun violence, adding their works to a genre that has blossomed like a furious bruise in recent years.",
		"6" : "No single work encompasses the enormous scope of the issue. Yet together they tell a story that demands our willingness to listen, and to listen again.",
		"7" : "Cite the numbers, and the problem instantly becomes too vast to grasp: More than 33,000 people killed and upward of 78,000 wounded by firearms each year in the United States, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Most of those aren’t going to make the news, and unless they are especially heinous or close to home, aren’t we a little inured to the ones that do?",
		"8" : "This is where the stealthy power of theater has an advantage, at least theoretically. There are dramas involving shootings in schools (“Punk Rock,” “The Faculty Room,” “The Library”) and workplaces (“Gloria”); attacks spurred by politics (“The Events”), racism (“Mother Emanuel”) or mental illness (“Holden”).",
		"9" : "There are plays focused on bystanders for whom gun killings are an everyday trauma (“Pass Over”) or a surreal aberration (“When It’s You”). Other shows are some combination of the above (“On the Exhale,” “Church & State,” “The Assignment”).",
		"10" : "News reports arrive after the fact, but theater can meddle with time and dimension, showing us the before, the during, the yet to come — as in Nathan Yungerberg’s “Esai’s Table,” which trails three black teenagers just past the threshold of the afterlife, where we come to understand what their needless, unwilling absence from the world will mean.",
		"11" : "Plays can put us in the room or on the street corner to eavesdrop on unguarded moments, on music and laughter — as in Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj, Adam Mace and Christian Lee Branch’s “Mother Emanuel,” a gospel-music celebration of the people gunned down at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.",
		"12" : "There is intimacy to that, because there is no glowing screen to separate us from the grief and devastation. The experience is visceral and enveloping in a way that the news is not. We may even forget that we are safe.",
		"13" : "In Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s musical “Assassins” (1990), about murderers and would-be murderers of United States presidents, there is a famous moment when Charles Guiteau, the killer of President James A. Garfield, trains his gun on the audience.",
		"14" : "Mr. Sondheim wrote in his book “Look, I Made a Hat”: “In every production I’ve seen, as his affability froze and he slowly panned over the crowd, not missing a patron, there has been a hush more chilling than at any moment in ‘Sweeney Todd.’ Facing the barrel of a gun, even when it’s just in a musical, is the kind of shock that can exist only in live theater.”",
		"15" : "This is true, and it worked precisely as intended the night I saw “Assassins” this spring at Yale Repertory Theater. The show itself, which gets at the congenital nature of this nation’s gun love, has a contemporary resonance that has only grown with the years.",
		"16" : "But it catapulted me backward, too, in an unexpected way: A scent wafted from the stage that reminded me of the cap guns my childhood best friend and his brothers used to play with. One of them, in young adulthood, would be murdered by a stranger with a gun.",
		"17" : "I’ve known three people who have died at the barrel of a gun, two from suicide. That feels like a high number to me, but Antoinette Nwandu’s urgent, poetic “Pass Over” — which I saw a year ago in a Cherry Lane Theater Mentor Project showcase, and which Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago will stage in June — persuades me that this perception is relative. In her play, two young black men in a bullet-riddled neighborhood of an unidentified American city are listing the people they’ve known who’ve been killed.",
		"18" : "“Andre,” Kitch says, 15 names in.",
		"19" : "“Which Andre?” his friend Moses asks.",
		"20" : "“Both,” says Kitch, who has many more names to add.",
		"21" : "The play, which transports the audience to the block that Kitch and Moses are eager to leave for a better life, captures in a way I have never encountered elsewhere the paralyzing effect of constant violence. Fearful of being shot by the police (“You heard they picked off Ed, though, right?” Kitch asks), these tough and likable guys repeatedly flinch at the sound — or, sometimes, in anticipation of the sound — of gunfire.",
		"22" : "The most haunting such play that I’ve seen, “Pass Over” requires no prop guns or fake blood. It relies on suggestion, and it is terrifying: both the physical danger and the existential despair. The knot that will need untangling if anything is ever truly to change for Kitch and Moses is viciously snarled.",
		"23" : "Getting us to look at that and comprehend it, to take us outside our own experience and alter us somehow by the time we leave the theater: That’s part of the charge for an artist wrestling with an issue as momentous as this. Yet the genre is still waiting for its great works. Too often there is a sense of preaching, perhaps angrily, to the choir, unspooling dramas whose reliably infuriating outlines we already know from the news.",
		"24" : "The graphic representation of carnage — in plays like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s “Gloria” and Simon Stephens’s “Punk Rock,” both of which are less about a particular instance of violence than the events surrounding it — can be a way of startling us into awareness, making witnesses out of observers. Yet such special effects often threaten to overwhelm a play, becoming its gory centerpiece, the thing that everyone talks about (or, in the case of “Gloria,” is asked not to, so as not to ruin the surprise).",
		"25" : "There is a macabre fascination to seeing blood spilled onstage. But does it take us any further in our understanding than an article in the newspaper, or the bystanders’ videos that can show us, online at any moment of any day, some person we’ve never met being shot to death? Where theater excels is in activating our imaginations and our empathy — coaxing us into picturing vivid scenarios inside our own heads. We can’t avert our gaze from those.",
		"26" : "Sensationalism, self-righteousness, sentimentality — there are plenty of traps lying in wait for playwrights examining gun violence.",
		"27" : "Jason Odell Williams’s “Church & State” leads awkwardly with comedy, then begins to preach as its politician protagonist decides that action, not prayer, is the sensible response in the wake of horror. William Electric Black’s “The Faculty Room,” set in a high school and running through April 30 at Theater for the New City, is indeed didactic, instructing the audience about the nexus of the Second Amendment and urban ills.",
		"28" : "Camilo Almonacid’s “The Assignment,” staged by Houses on the Moon Theater Company through May 7 at A.R.T./New York Theaters, struggles to make a mother’s long-ago loss of her son to gun violence as sympathetic as the bumbling efforts of a sweet ex-con (memorably played by Erick Betancourt) to forge a new life nearly 20 years after he pulled the trigger on someone.",
		"29" : "Among the most harrowing stage moments involving a firearm that I’ve seen lately, in fact, wasn’t in a gun play. It was in Stephan Wolfert’s autobiographical military monologue “Cry Havoc!” for the theater company Bedlam, when he re-enacted a suicidal impulse, miming the sawed-off shotgun he jammed up against his jaw. Clearly he didn’t go through with it, but I couldn’t get the worry out of my head: Does he still own guns? After the show, because I know him as a reporter, I did the intrusive thing and asked. My whole body relaxed when he said no.",
		"30" : "Last Sunday night, I saw another Houses on the Moon production called “Gun Country,” which continues through May 3 at A.R.T./New York Theaters. Directed by Jenna Worsham, it is a program not of plays but of stories told by people whose lives have been touched by guns, sometimes in positive ways. One of the most potent tales is Ms. Worsham’s own, which begins with a warm recollection of her teenage Southern self getting the 12-gauge Beretta semiautomatic she’d longed for.",
		"31" : "Ms. Worsham is a Manhattanite now, and her views on gun control have evolved. But she understands people who regard regulation as “a dirty word,” as she puts it. She looks at the people she’s known all her life who hold views that she abhors, and she loves them anyway — an extraordinary ability in this riven culture of ours."

		"2" : "Mr. Bourdain has plenty of advice for travelers looking to avoid both frustration and food poisoning. “Don’t get angry; don’t be the person huffing and puffing and getting angry in the security line,” he said. “It doesn’t help. Like a recidivist convict, you should go limp. Nothing else. And dress for security. I don’t carry liquids or gels, I don’t wear a belt or any jewelry, I get my stuff out and in the tray very quickly and I’m through.”",
		"3" : "He usually doesn’t eat on planes, preferring airport food to airplane food. “I’m tragically familiar with the offerings at just about every airport in the world,” he said. “Probably Changi Airport in Singapore has the best food; it has a hawker center for the employees that’s open to the public. Tokyo has a sushi bar right near the gates serving flights to the States that’s extraordinarily good for an airport sushi place. And, as important, it has a Lawson convenience store that has these ethereal egg salad sandwiches that defy logic and science with their deliciousness and apparent freshness. They sit there at near room temperature for I don’t know how long on white bread wrapped in plastic, and I don’t know why but they’re ridiculously good.”",
		"4" : "He has strong feelings when it comes to the right attitude for travel. “Just be nice,” he said. “Getting angry and frustrated in much of the world doesn’t help at all. It’s incomprehensible, you lose face, it makes you look ridiculous. Have a willingness to try new stuff. Be grateful for any hospitality offered. And be flexible in your plans, because a rigid itinerary is lethal to a good time.”",
		"5" : "Here’s what he takes on every trip:",
		"6" : "Pillow substitute",
		"7" : "“I always carry a sweatshirt or a scrunchable lightweight down jacket, in case the plane is cold. But just as useful if I need a pillow in an airport, if I have to curl up on a floor or a bench. Actual neck pillows are too bulky and take up too much space.”",
		"8" : "Moleskine notebooks",

I bring a couple of [the uniforms called] gi, actually, because one has to give serious consideration, always, I have found, to laundry cycles in hotels. I’m very aware that you need to get it in by 9 or 10 if you want it back the same day and one can’t always do that. I’m a worst-case scenario planner, so chances are I’ll bring three gi just in case the laundry cycle is not what I would like.”",
		"12" : "Books",
		"13" : "“I bring at least one physical book, I find that comforting. Often a book set in the country that I’m headed towards. A work of fiction, preferably. The perfect book to read before you go to Vietnam is Graham Greene’s ‘The Quiet American.’ Fiction seems to capture the place in a way that’s more tangible. It just works for me better than a travel guide.”",

We were eating a buffet dinner and watching a talent show that combined sideshow stunts by performers — walking on nails and blowing flames into the sky — with gymnastics and G-rated jokes by guests, who included children and a few brave parents. When the crowd applauded, my 18-month-old daughter, Roxie, clapped excitedly with them. In the show’s final act, an otherwise dignified Canadian father with Justin Trudeau-like good looks thrust his pelvis across the makeshift stage as if possessed by the spirit of Elvis Presley.",
		"2" : "I had somehow stepped into a scene from “Dirty Dancing,” transported to a Catskills resort, circa 1963. It wouldn’t be the last time, during our five-day stay, that I’d feel this sense of generational disorientation — of being not so much in another country as in another era.",
		"3" : "Though my husband, Tim, Roxie and I had already been on the island for two days, we had not yet left the walled confines of our resort. Not only that: We had no plans to leave. Not even once.",
		"4" : "It wasn’t that we weren’t interested in seeing the island, birthplace of Rastafarianism, home of reggae and land of rum cake and jerk chicken. But as the parents of an increasingly energetic (and exhausting) toddler, our primary motivation for this trip — I’m embarrassed to admit — was not culture or music or even the lush expanse of the Blue Mountains.",
		"5" : "It was babysitting. Affordable, reliable child care and the possibility, at least, of a vacation that actually felt like a vacation.",
		"6" : "To that end, we had maxed out our modest travel budget on airfare ($430 per flight) and four all-inclusive nights ($340 per night) before we even arrived. If the trip went as planned, we wouldn’t spend another dollar — beyond tips, of course — after takeoff from New York’s Kennedy International Airport.",

Resort & Spa, a modest, charmingly dated property an hour’s drive from Montego Bay, a cruise ship port and the country’s fourth largest city. I had noticed that it was mentioned in Facebook moms’ groups and family travel forums, where I did a fair amount of anxious late-night lurking. F.D.R., as it’s known among its many fans, had devotees — families who returned year after year. And I wanted to know why.",

I couldn’t imagine it. A year and a half into parenthood, Tim and I had hired a babysitter only once. A nanny — a word I associate with British period dramas — seemed impossibly luxurious, as out of reach for two working writers as a personal chef or a private plane. But at F.D.R., Ms. Dixon’s time and expertise was included in the price of our stay.",
		"11" : "Having descended from a matrilineal line of women who were paid to care for other people’s children, I felt deeply conflicted about the “vacation nanny” concept before we arrived. I worried that it undervalued the work of women like my mother and grandmother. It seemed potentially exploitative.",
		"12" : "But the balance between cost and convenience is something with which every parent on a budget must grapple. Most of us make choices, at least occasionally, that we aren’t entirely comfortable with — that raise questions we don’t have easy answers to.",
		"13" : "I expected to feel uncomfortable in the hermetically sealed bubble of the resort, but the disorientation came as soon as we were on the airport shuttle bus. I felt uneasy at taking a vacation in another country with no intention of engaging with the people or culture, history or environment — or even just day-to-day life — of that place.",
		"14" : "There I was, watching Jamaica from a shuttle window. The driver, doing his best to engage his passengers’ interest in the country they were visiting, performed a perfunctory call and response, quizzing us on the colors of the national flag: “gold for the sunshine”; “green for vegetation, including the ganja”; and “black.” “What is black for? Black is for the people,” he said proudly. His audience of sun-seeking Canadian and American tourists seemed disinterested.",
		"15" : "After delivering passengers to three other resorts, we arrived at F.D.R., named for its owner, Franklyn, not the president. The place was compact and cheerfully bright. Unlike the towering white behemoths we’d passed, it was just three stories tall, with 78 rooms, cobalt blue shutters and turquoise and lemon yellow piers jutting into the ocean. Narrow walkways wound through gardens planted in Christmas palms, lantana and hibiscus. The beach was piled with kayaks and paddleboards. The staff seemed to outnumber the guests.",
		"16" : "Our very first night, tempted by the prospect of a dinner date, I broke my own rule and spent $18 to hire Ms. Dixon to return for a two-hour babysitting stint outside her normal 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift. Ms. Dixon had short cropped hair, an unaffected smile and a 14-year-old daughter of her own. She had worked at F.D.R. for 16 years. She was about my age, and it was clear she took her job seriously.",
		"17" : "The $9-an-hour splurge was worth it, not to be stuck in the room — a pleasant, but spare two-room suite with floral bed spreads and tropical prints on the walls — after Roxie’s usual 7 p.m. bedtime. Tim and I sat at a patio table above the beach, ate escovitch fish and eavesdropped on the neighboring table’s political conversation about the recent United States presidential election before joining in ourselves. The two families, from Montreal and the Washington, D.C., area, had both been coming to the resort for years and had become friends.",
		"18" : "The Canadian family had three children, while the other had four adopted special-needs children (F.D.R. gives a 50 percent discount for such families). Both families loved the place and knew it inside and out. I could see immediately how, for families with multiple children, the resort would have particular appeal. The older kids were free to take turns whooshing down Big Blue — the resort’s looping 100-foot water slide — snorkel at the small, sheltered beach or play video games in the teen club house, while the younger children were looked after by their nannies, who hover over them in lavender uniforms. (Though the resort declined to specify the hourly rate it pays nannies, an additional daytime nanny costs just $25 per day, which comes to a troubling $3 an hour in a country where a 10-pack of diapers costs $12.)",
		"19" : "Having worked with hundreds of children over the years, Ms. Dixon was almost certainly a more competent caregiver than I, a first-time parent, not yet two years in. Still, I had to force myself to step back, let Ms. Dixon do her job and not feel guilty about sitting at the open-air bar, sipping a rum and pineapple, watching Roxie on a beach cluttered with primary-colored play structures, content among the other children and their respective nannies.",
		"20" : "During our first two days on the island, the weather was moody. But having narrowly escaped a New York nor’easter, we were unbothered by the choppy surf and darkened skies that kept us from the ocean. Tim and I, slowly getting used to being freed from child care, did childish things. He joined a ragtag collection of guests and played beach volleyball for the first time in his life, bloodying his knees diving for the ball. I rediscovered my love of water slides, racing up the wooden stairs to Big Blue again and again.",
		"21" : "When the sun finally came out and the wind relented, we outfitted Roxie in the smallest life vest we could find and climbed aboard F.D.R.’s glass-bottomed boat — a shabby vessel with a picture frame bottom. After days of stormy weather, the water was cloudy, but Roxie was nonetheless enamored by her undersea view of the sandy bottom, occasional head of coral and hungry schools of shimmering fish, which jumped and churned for dinner rolls tossed overboard.",
		"22" : "Our tall, sinewy captain called himself Jack Sparrow and, in a running narration that veered into magical realism, referred to the fish as his “babies” and melded characters from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Finding Nemo” with local legends about sunken ships and crashed airplanes. This was a man who enjoyed his job.",
		"23" : "Before returning to F.D.R., Captain Jack did a Hollywood tour bus-style drive-by of Unity House, an 18th-century stone structure that resembles a Georgian mansion, but is actually a former banana warehouse where the cast of Monty Python stayed in 1982, while developing “The Life of Brian.”",
		"24" : "That night, our last at F.D.R., was Friday and dinner came with a show. Footsie, “the one-man band,” played techno remixes of wedding party classics like “Y.M.C.A.” on a synthesizer as blue, green and red lights pulsed overhead. The elaborately costumed “Bridgette” exhorted the audience for volunteers. The performer wore a bustle and heavy makeup that may have blended into a crowd raucously celebrating Caribbean Carnival festivities but felt cringingly out of context in front of our small, seated audience of clapping foreigners.",
		"25" : "Despite lifelong stage fright, I bowed to pressure when I was summoned to the center of the room. With dinner guests looking on, I followed Bridgette’s instructions, popping my hips forward and back on her one-two-one-two command. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Tim recording the mortifying moment on his cellphone — in case, presumably, he ever needed to blackmail me. My performance was clumsy and embarrassing, but also strangely exhilarating. It made me realize how long it had been since I was forced outside my comfort zone and how the resort bubble itself offered something valuable — it offered focused, undistracted time. Time alone, time together as a couple, and time as a family.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Traveling with children is many things. Relaxing is not typically among them. The exception is a trip that includes at least some help with child care — time when parents are free to luxuriate in that rarest of parental indulgences: time alone. But finding reliable, affordable child care can be enough of a challenge at home. Where does one even begin to get such help on the road? Here are five strategies for finding the right fit for your family.",
		"2" : "Child care is not cheap. And what’s affordable for one family is out of reach for another. Just as at home, vacation child care needs vary wildly. The first — and most important — step in securing help on the road is deceptively simple: Honestly assess your family’s wants versus needs, consider what kind of care you’ll be comfortable with and realistically calculate what you can afford. For a lazy, leisurely beach vacation to Hawaii, Mexico or the Caribbean, a resort that includes on-site child care in its price may be the answer. A long weekend in an exciting city? Hiring a background-checked, highly reviewed babysitter on sites like care.com or urbansitter.com for a few evening hours may do the trick. The contours of your trip — whether you’re traveling with one infant or three school-age children, for example — will determine what options are available to you. It may seem obvious, but it’s worth stepping back and really taking stock of your needs.",
		"3" : "Many self-described family resorts offer some form of complimentary child care, but the setup and limitations vary. For example, Club Med Resorts offer “kids clubs,” a day-care-like setting that typically excludes children under the age of 4. At three North American locations — Sandpiper Bay in Florida, Ixtapa in Mexico and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic — babysitting is available for babies and toddlers (four months and older) for an additional $79 (low season) to $95 (high season) per day. But if your child is under 5, it’s wise to check the specific requirements, such as whether a child is toilet trained. For infants and toddlers, babysitters are often available for one-on-one care for an additional fee. Kids’ clubs are usually broken into different age groups, with the youngest children separated from bigger kids and teenagers. A handful of resorts, including Franklyn D. Resort in Runaway Bay, Jamaica, and the three Caribbean locations of Sandals’ Beaches resorts, offer private “vacation nannies” — babysitters assigned to each family — at no additional cost.",
		"4" : "Having seen Jamaica’s Franklyn D. Resort described in online forums as affordable, I was initially taken aback by the $340-a-night price tag for the least expensive room. But then I took a mental tally of everything that was included: transportation to and from the airport, three restaurant meals a day for two adults and a child, entertainment, top-shelf liquor, sports equipment and — the ultimate perk — full-time individual child care. While $170 per adult was still a splurge for our family, the trip suddenly seemed like a bargain. Babysitting alone is $12 to $17 an hour for one child in many parts of the United States, according to Urbansitter.com’s annual child care rate survey.",
		"5" : "For parents who are uneasy about leaving their child with even a well-vetted stranger in an unfamiliar place, the best bet may be bringing along a family member, friend or trusted babysitter from home. Retired grandparents, who often have flexible schedules, seem to be a popular choice. But not all grandparents are up for the challenge, and, of course, not everyone considers a trip with their parents or in-laws a “vacation.” Other possibilities include a responsible niece or nephew — or another teenager in your life — who could benefit from travel themselves and help in exchange for the experience. When this works well, everybody wins. You get an extra set of diaper-changing hands, kid-wrangling skills and watchful eyes, and your travel companion-guest worker gets a free or nearly-free vacation. Clearly, this arrangement is the trickiest. It means not only finding the right person, but also agreeing on what help they will provide and what travel expenses you will cover. It important to make expectations, on both sides, clear.",
		"6" : "Consider traveling with another family and sharing the cost of a comfortable Airbnb or vacation rental. A two-family vacation doubles the number of adults on hand to look after the children. One set of parents can stay in during daytime naps or after the evening bedtime, while the other gets to enjoy some non-kid-friendly outings, like a strenuous hike or an evening of live music. By taking turns with babysitting duties, child care is free.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LOS ANGELES — Mark Bradford, one of America’s most acclaimed painters, could not figure out what to put in the grand rotunda.",
		"2" : "This artist, who is set to represent his country in May at the 2017 Venice Biennale, found an unusual way of working long-distance. In a warehouse in South Los Angeles, not far from where he grew up, he created a full-size model of the Biennale’s United States pavilion, a stately building with echoes of Monticello. Then he spent the last year testing out his ideas in it.",
		"3" : "“This a Jeffersonian-type space, something you see in state capitols,” he said, pointing to its central dome. “I wanted it to feel like a ruin, like we went into a governmental building and started shaking the rotunda and the plaster started falling off. Our rage made the plaster fall off the walls.”",
		"4" : "With a nod to its Palladian architecture, Mr. Bradford often calls his pavilion the White House. As in: “I wanted to bring the White House to me.”",
		"5" : "Sitting on a crate, his long legs extended, Mr. Bradford, 55, was confronting a pressing concern beyond exhibition plans: How can he represent the United States abroad at a time when — as a black, gay man and a self-proclaimed “liberal and progressive thinker” — he no longer feels represented by his own government.",
		"6" : "The broad social changes in America — from the police violence that ignited the Black Lives Matter movement to the messages of hate that he feels were unleashed by the November election — fueled a personal sense of crisis that permeates much of his forthcoming show in Venice, “Tomorrow Is Another Day.”",
		"7" : "He remembered being invited to the Obama White House with other artists two years ago and feeling that “our voices mattered — fast-forward, and now they’re talking about cutting the N.E.A.,” he said, shaking his head.",
		"8" : "And, aware of his own status as an international art star with million-dollar sales, he expressed concern for those more vulnerable.",
		"9" : "“I felt like a lot of the progress we’ve made to be inclusive, to make sure young little trans kids are safe, was gone in the blink of an eye,” he said. “Making this body of work became very, very emotional for me. I felt I was making it in a house that was burning.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Bradford’s replica, Doric columns and all, gave him a chance to try to bring something of the Giardini, the Venice park that hosts the national pavilions, to South Los Angeles and vice versa.",
		"11" : "In the rotunda, he first tried lining the walls with silver paper. Then he installed a colorful “waterfall” sculpture — a cascade of paper strips.",
		"12" : "Finally, nine or 10 versions in, he realized he needed to “keep it hot, keep it urgent.” He plastered the walls with what looks like a decaying mural: a gritty collage of fragmented images from cellphone ads scavenged from the neighborhood, which target the friends and family of prison inmates. “Receive calls on your cellphone from jail,” they say — in exchange for what turn out to be predatory rates.",
		"13" : "He calls the merchant posters “parasitic” for the way they profit from misfortune. And he sees his work as “a reminder: Don’t forget there are people in need.”",
		"14" : "Judging from the mock pavilion, the Venice show could be his most urgent exhibition to date. Inside, his roughly elegant abstract paintings have erupted into sculpture, and he is pushing the limit of how much personal and political weight an abstract canvas can actually carry.",
		"15" : "“Building the pavilion was great, because I was making this thing that’s all about power into a safe place where I could play, have angst, fall on the ground,” said Mr. Bradford, who, at 6-foot-8, was slouching to make himself more accessible. “It’s like taking a hairbrush and lip-syncing your favorite song in the mirror when nobody’s looking.”",
		"16" : "While pavilion funding comes primarily from a State Department grant of up to $250,000, it is not unusual for selected artists to bite the hand that feeds them.",
		"17" : "Several have questioned the Olympic-sport model of “representing” a country, and some have made their Biennale art a platform for challenging such nationalism. In 2011, the artist duo Allora & Calzadilla took on the American military complex by installing an upside-down tank outside the American pavilion, with a treadmill on top used by a runner. (Roberta Smith of The New York Times called it “angry, sophomoric Conceptualism that borders on the tyrannical.”)",
		"18" : "Mr. Bradford’s exhibition is not as explicitly political but shaped as a loose journey of self-discovery that can be read in mythological or biographical terms or, often, both at once.",
		"19" : "The mythological references first appear in a poem by Mr. Bradford hanging on the pavilion’s facade, written in the voice of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire, metalworking and sculpture. He encounters Medusa: “Mad as hell/I looked her dead in the eye/And he knew her.”",
		"20" : "Mr. Bradford drew from one version of the Hephaestus myth, in which the boy breaks his foot when cast out of Olympus for trying to protect his mother from a punishing Zeus. “Somehow that story just rang true,” Mr. Bradford said. “That’s the story I heard growing up.”",
		"21" : "His own life has a bit of an Olympian arc. His single mother raised him in a boardinghouse in South Central while building, at odd hours, her business as a hairstylist. After he was bullied for being, he said, “a sissy,” she moved them to Santa Monica — a more accepting, “Birkenstock-wearing, fruit-juicing” hippie enclave. Later, as a young gay man in his 20s, he wandered and traveled, feeling no reason to plan for a future when he saw so many men with H.I.V. dying. Finally he went back to school, studying art in community college before being accepted into the game-changing California Institute of the Arts.",
		"22" : "After earning his B.F.A. and M.F.A., he was in his late 30s and working in his mother’s salon when he created his breakthrough paintings: Agnes Martin-inspired abstractions made from the white endpapers used in perming hair. “I liked how they pointed to the world,” he said. “And I could get a whole box of endpapers for 50 cents. I would affix them to bedsheets, because I couldn’t afford canvas.”",
		"23" : "Soon that would change: The paintings caught the eye of the curator Thelma Golden, scouting at the time for her groundbreaking 2001 “post-black” survey, “Freestyle,” at the Studio Museum of Harlem, and the collector Eileen Harris Norton, now a close friend and one of the few to see the mock-pavilion in progress. (She called it a “powerful and complete experience — I like that Mark is telling a full story.”)",
		"24" : "His Biennale exhibition starts, and almost stops, with a bulbous red and black sculpture, “Spoiled Foot.” Bulging from the ceiling, it forces visitors to hug the room’s periphery. And its mottled, diseased-looking surface, made from canvas and paper, is as close as this artist has come to ugliness.",
		"25" : "This blistered skin is no accident. Mr. Bradford, who talks about feeling “pushed out” by his own country these days, says he first felt a profound sense of “expulsion” when the AIDS crisis hit hard with painful deaths, compounded by government indifference.",
		"26" : "The second gallery features another sculpture, “Medusa,” made of black paper rolls as thick as fire hoses that have been soaked, wrung and shaped into coils that recall the snakes of Medusa’s hair. Three new paintings, each named for a Siren, hang on the walls. They are his first endpaper paintings in 13 years and his darkest yet, the papers dyed to create a black-on-black palette. “I like the tension between the dark paintings, where everything is underneath, and the Medusa sculpture, this externalized rage,” he said.",
		"27" : "Christopher Bedford, who proposed Mr. Bradford to the State Department on behalf of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis (he now runs the Baltimore Museum of Art, which is co-presenting the U.S. Pavilion), sees this gallery, with its hair imagery, as an “homage to the black women who were the ballast of Mark’s life in the beauty salons before he could stand on his own two feet.”",
		"28" : "“Black is not ever a neutral color, especially in the hands of a black painter,” said Mr. Bedford, who curated the exhibition with Katy Siegel. “To go that deep into black is a very heavy and loaded action.”",
		"29" : "The dark tone of the exhibition changes after a passage through the rotunda, leading to new, large-scale paintings that evoke cellular or galactic forms — and a feeling of expansiveness. He makes these paintings without brushes or any kind of liquid or powdered paint, building up layers of colored paper on canvas and using a tool, like an automobile sander, to expose the various hues buried in the layers. Or, as Mr. Bedford put it, “He’s using the sander as a paintbrush.”",
		"30" : "The final gallery can be read as a celebration of the gay black body, featuring his video “Niagara” (2005). It follows a black man in orange shorts walking, with the flamboyant hip action of Marilyn Monroe, on the streets of South Central. The video touches on sexual and economic vulnerability but also exuberance. Perhaps Mr. Bradford, who has borrowed the exhibition’s title from the last line of the Civil War novel “Gone With the Wind,” is ending on an optimistic note?",
		"31" : "The rotunda, with its prison references, offers a link to the artist’s new project outside the pavilion walls: He has made a six-year commitment to help fund a prison cooperative in Venice that assists inmates in building job skills. The program, Rio Terà dei Pensieri, helps prisoners run a farmer’s market and manufacture goods like cosmetics to be sold. With his backing, Rio Terà is also opening a store in Venice this month.",
		"32" : "Closer to home, in Los Angeles, Mr. Bradford’s community work and philanthropy focus on foster youths in Leimert Park, the neighborhood where his mother had her salon Foxyé Hair. (She now lives in Atlanta.)",
		"33" : "Three years ago, he, Ms. Harris Norton and his life partner, Allan DiCastro, a former banker who had also been a neighborhood council leader, formed a nonprofit group, Art+Practice, to help offer services like housing and job preparation to local teenagers in foster care.",
		"34" : "Mr. Bradford used part of his $500,000 MacArthur “genius” grant for its start-up costs. The group is now funded mainly through his art sales. While other artists today position their activism as artworks (“social practice” is the buzzword), Mr. Bradford does not regard Art+Practice as his art project. He plays down his creative role, stressing the importance of working within the existing community fabric, even if it is torn and frayed.",
		"35" : "“You have to do a lot of listening for communities in need,” he said. In the process of researching Leimert Park, he learned that 40 percent of the district’s high school students were in foster care. He brought a similar approach to Rio Terà.",
		"36" : "“I had to ask myself when I got this pavilion, what do I want to do with this?” he said. “I knew I did not want to stand on the mountaintop as Mark Bradford but find a way to help build different relationships.”",
		"37" : "He is hoping they will last long after his large paintings have left the United States pavilion and the summer crowds empty out of the leafy Giardini."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LOS ANGELES — Before Mac DeMarco bought a lovely blue home with a pool on a quiet hill here in Silver Lake — the first real adult spoils of a surprising career built on seeming like an affable deadbeat — he gave out his exact address to fans, not exactly expecting them to show up in droves.",
		"2" : "“Stop on by — I’ll make you a cup of coffee,” Mr. DeMarco, a mischievous singer and songwriter, said on a whim at the end of “My House by the Water,” an instrumental track from 2015. His place, a four-bedroom on the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, was relatively secluded, directly across Jamaica Bay from Kennedy International Airport. But accessibility aside, people soon started showing up, and they didn’t really stop for the next six months.",
		"3" : "“We had thousands of kids, all through the day, all hours,” Mr. DeMarco recalled recently as he chain-smoked Marlboro Reds in his new backyard, surrounded by overflowing ashtrays and discarded cans of beer and seltzer. “It was crazy. I really liked it.”",
		"4" : "True to his word and reputation, he played amiable host to those making the Rockaway pilgrimage — his longtime girlfriend, Kiera McNally, “was a good sport for as long as she could be” — even as summer bloomed and space got tight. “Sometimes we’d have like 40 people sitting against the sea wall watching us rehearse,” Mr. DeMarco said, insisting that the impetuous stunt did not lead to any negative experiences and only brought him closer to his fan base.",
		"5" : "That’s the kind of easygoing intimacy and relatability that has turned Mr. DeMarco, who is originally from Edmonton, Alberta, into what has become a rare breed: a breakout indie-rock idol whose consistent musical output — mostly mellow guitar pop in the mold of ’60s and ’70s songwriters like Harry Nilsson, Neil Young and John Lennon — is only bolstered by a fervent cult of personality.",
		"6" : "As a kind of pied piper for the blog crowd, Mr. DeMarco, with his trademark gaptoothed smile and disarming baby blues, has tended to his flock not so much with the dubiously revealing gimmicks of social media, but on-the-ground, grass-roots outreach via nonstop touring and direct human connection.",
		"7" : "His new album, “This Old Dog,” out Friday, May 5, is his third full-length LP and fifth release in five years on the independent Brooklyn label Captured Tracks, with each enjoying exponential growth. (“Salad Days,” his previous album, sold more than 100,000 copies in the United States.) But instead of blowing out his sound for bigger festival stages and more crossover opportunities, Mr. DeMarco has knowingly pulled back with a collection of his softest, most personal songs, recorded at home in Los Angeles, mostly on acoustic guitar.",
		"8" : "“It’s funny, as things progress, I just want to keep making them smaller and smaller,” Mr. DeMarco said, his natural inclination toward a do-it-yourself punk ethos shining through. “I try to retain a certain amount of control. I’m not a freak, but I don’t want to do anything that I don’t want to do.”",
		"9" : "He also seemed to recognize how crucial a sense of connectedness has been to his success. Approachable, genuine and undeniably charismatic, Mr. DeMarco, who turns 27 on Sunday, April 30, is a recognizable archetype to anyone familiar with small-time local music scenes — a trendsetting merrymaker likely to get drunk and pull down his pants onstage, but who also happens to be a devoted songwriter.",
		"10" : "“I’m not the artiste — we’re just having a good time,” Mr. DeMarco said, recalling being drawn as a teenager to bands “that made me go, ‘Oh, I can do this, too!’” He added: “Kids tune in and they’re like, ‘Mac would drink a beer with me.’ And the answer is probably yes! These people are paying my mortgage, putting food on the table for me and my girlfriend. Thank you! And you like the music? That’s crazy.”",
		"11" : "But as grateful as he is for the support, Mr. DeMarco was realistic and self-aware in acknowledging that his irreverent rock ’n’ roll prankster vibe and sense of humor — onstage, in legend and in countless playful YouTube videos — has spawned a following almost apart from his solid yet unassuming songs.",
		"12" : "“I’m like a meme,” he said. “My music is one thing, and then there’s also this weird personality that people attach to it.” That comes with expectations. “Nowadays, it’s like, ‘Put the cigarette between your teeth, man!’ But I did that already.”",
		"13" : "Yet some bewilderment aside, Mr. DeMarco insisted that he harbors no existential anxiety about the jester role, mostly because it’s not a character. “I’ve always tried to keep public Mac and me Mac fairly in line with one another so it doesn’t become weird,” he said. It also provides a firewall for his art.",
		"14" : "Mike Sniper, the founder of Captured Tracks, who signed Mr. DeMarco solely on the strength of songs uploaded to Bandcamp, marveled at the multiple facets of the singer’s career. “He’s given himself total privacy in his own music to make whatever he wants,” Mr. Sniper said. “Who else is afforded to be that serious as a musician and that goofy in person? I can’t think of anyone who can pull that off as well as he has.”",
		"15" : "Mr. DeMarco toured and released music in Canadian obscurity, mostly under the name Makeout Videotape, for years before he signed to a label with any influence. When he did, releasing the more experimental, lo-fi “Rock and Roll Nightclub” in 2012 on Captured Tracks, the indie-rock stars were aligning.",
		"16" : "The label, which had success with groups like Dum Dum Girls, Wild Nothing and Beach Fossils, had become “Pitchfork’s darling,” Mr. Sniper said of the gatekeeping music website, which was once a peerless tastemaker in that world and began championing Mr. DeMarco. “Whatever cultural cachet we had, he really took advantage of it and went nuts from there,” Mr. Sniper said.",
		"17" : "Mr. DeMarco’s freewheeling, wide-scale debut also came on the heels of a more self-serious moment in the genre, which was dominated by headliners like Animal Collective, Arcade Fire and Dirty Projectors. “I played the internet game a lot in the first couple years,” Mr. DeMarco said. “A lot of videos, a lot of interviews, a lot of content.”",
		"18" : "He added, “A lot of bands don’t give it up like I do, I guess.”",
		"19" : "Even today, Mr. DeMarco’s every move is parsed online by obsessives. In addition to his rapper-esque 643,000 Instagram followers, the active r/macdemarco Reddit community includes speculation about not only his songwriting but also fluctuations in his weight (“Anybody else concerned with Mac’s recent decline in physical health?”), his finances and his relationship with Ms. McNally, who has become a co-star among the cast of characters in Mac World.",
		"20" : "Another is Agnes, Mr. DeMarco’s mother, who has leaned into her niche celebrity status and now runs her son’s official, tongue-in-cheek fan club. “Right off the hop, these kids wanted to be my Facebook friend,” Ms. DeMarco said in an interview.",
		"21" : "She described her son as a curious and enthusiastic child, who was “perhaps a bit of a rabble-rouser — very, very full of energy, much like he is now.” She added: “He draws people to him. Mac always traveled in a herd of kids, and even if they didn’t want to like him, they ended up liking him.”",
		"22" : "Mr. DeMarco’s immediate loved ones have long featured in his music as well as his career, though he favors what he called “vague, pretty common themes and not very specific lyrics — little pop song nuggets.” But on “This Old Dog,” which Mr. DeMarco started at the Rockaway house and returned to after his move to California, he got more thematically pointed than ever, calling the songs “diary-entry style.”",
		"23" : "The opening track, “My Old Man,” plainly addresses the father he grew up without and who struggled with addiction (“Uh-oh, looks like I’m seeing more of my old man in me”). The album was inspired in part by the two reconnecting under dire circumstances: a cancer diagnosis.",
		"24" : "“I’d say see you later, if I thought I’d see you later and I’d tell you that I loved you if I did,” Mr. DeMarco sings in “Moonlight on the River.” The album ends on the line: “And even though you barely know each other, it still hurts watching him fade away.”",
		"25" : "“It was my ‘See you later, partner,’” Mr. DeMarco said of the low-key LP, its sound stemming from the singer’s recent deep-dives into the careers of Paul Simon, James Taylor and Yellow Magic Orchestra. But in a twist, his father has since recovered to an extent, outlasting his diagnosis.",
		"26" : "“I didn’t think he would ever hear the songs,” Mr. DeMarco said. “Now he’s like, ‘I’m baaack,’ and I’m like, [expletive].”",
		"27" : "That this introspective moment coincides with Mr. DeMarco’s turning a corner into his late 20s and adjusting his lifestyle accordingly is probably not a coincidence. “I have retracted a little bit from just giving everything away,” he said of his public persona. But maturation is a funny thing for a singer whose generous high jinks are foundational to his popularity.",
		"28" : "At his home in Los Angeles, those contradictions were on display as domesticity coexisted with the Neverland aspects of playing rock for a living. Guitars and gear were strewn in almost every room, and band mates had colonized the extra space, all while Ms. McNally baked sourdough bread and cinnamon buns, reminding Mr. DeMarco to take his fiber supplement. (He ate a spoonful of frosting instead.)",
		"29" : "“I’ve lived in way too many crawlspace rooms,” Mr. DeMarco remarked, taking in his yard with astonishment and uttering a string of curse words for emphasis. “It’s such a fluke, so lucky and so amazing,” he said motioning over the pool, which at that point he had yet to swim in. “Look at this! See this! From playing guitar? It’s ridiculous.”"

		"1" : "Political figures loom large in our featured titles this week: Hillary Clinton, whose presidential campaign receives a painful autopsy in “Shattered”; Paul Ryan, whose Wisconsin hometown is the subject of “Janesville”; and George W. Bush, whose best-selling book of paintings of veterans, “Portraits of Courage,” occasions debate about the value of bearing witness to a war of your own making. Dominic Dromgoole’s “Hamlet Globe to Globe” takes readers around the world with a production of Shakespeare’s tragedy, and a debut novel, “My Cat Yugoslavia,” enchants with its depiction of the disorientation of exile.",
		"2" : "—Radhika JonesEditorial Director, Books",
		"3" : "SHATTERED: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. (Crown, $28.) This blow-by-blow account of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run for the White House includes observations by campaign and Democratic Party insiders. “The portrait of the Clinton campaign that emerges from these pages,” our critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, “is that of a Titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff.”",
		"4" : "THE NEW BOOK OF SNOBS: A Definitive Guide to Modern Snobbery, by D.J. Taylor. (Constable, About $21.) Taylor’s clever and timely taxonomy of snobbery argues that the world would be a poorer place without a bit of insolence and ostentation. Our critic Dwight Garner wrote that Taylor is “astute, supremely well read and frequently very funny. In its combination of impact with effervescence, his book puts me in mind of a Black Velvet, that curious cocktail made from Guinness stout and champagne.”",
		"5" : "JANESVILLE: An American Story, by Amy Goldstein. (Simon & Schuster, $27.) Goldstein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Washington Post, writes in “Janesville” about the impact on the small Wisconsin factory city of the title when General Motors closes a plant there. Janesville also happens to be the hometown of Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Our critic Jennifer Senior called the book “eye-opening, important, a diligent work of reportage.”",
		"6" : "HAMLET GLOBE TO GLOBE: Two Years, 190,000 Miles, 197 Countries, One Play, by Dominic Dromgoole. (Grove, $27.) To celebrate the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth, London’s Globe Theater performed “Hamlet” all around the world. Dromgoole’s witty account of the ambitious two-year tour — “a compulsively readable, intensely personal chronicle of performances in places as various as Djibouti and Gdansk, Taipei and Bogotá,” in the words of our reviewer, Stephen Greenblatt — offers insight about the play and its enduring appeal.",
		"7" : "ONE OF THE BOYS, by Daniel Magariel. (Scribner, $22.) After a brutal custody battle, two brothers watch their father drift into addiction in a gripping and heartfelt first novel that brims with wisdom about the self-destructive longing for paternal approval. For all the betrayal and resentment that binds them, Magariel’s characters feel neither typecast nor pitied.",
		"8" : "A RABBLE OF DEAD MONEY: The Great Crash and the Global Depression, 1929-1939, by Charles R. Morris. (PublicAffairs, $29.99.) This overview of the policy response to the Great Depression is a deft synthesis, blending colorful accounts of the past with the scholarly literature of the present and stretching beyond U.S. borders. Instead of focusing on Wall Street, Morris turns his attention to the other side of the Atlantic, arguing that “All of the tangled threads that twisted together to create the catastrophe of the Depression originated in Europe.”",
		"9" : "THE KNOWLEDGE ILLUSION: Why We Never Think Alone, by Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach. (Riverhead, $28.) Two cognitive scientists argue that not only rationality but the very idea of individual thinking is a myth, and that humans think in groups. That’s not necessarily bad news, writes Yuval Harari in our review: “Our reliance on groupthink has made us masters of the world.… From an evolutionary perspective, trusting in the knowledge of others has worked extremely well for humans.”",
		"10" : "MY CAT YUGOSLAVIA, by Pajtim Statovci. Translated by David Hackston. (Pantheon, $25.95.) Statovci’s strange, haunting and utterly original exploration of displacement and desire interweaves the stories of a Kosovan woman and her son roiled by the aftershocks of exile. A singing, dancing cat encountered in a gay bar plays a role. In our review, Téa Obreht writes that the book is “a marvel, a remarkable achievement and a world apart from anything you are likely to read this year.”",
		"11" : "PORTRAITS OF COURAGE: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors, by George W. Bush. (Crown, $35.) The former president began painting three years after leaving the White House, inspired by Winston Churchill. Now Bush’s portraits of 98 veterans, accompanied by their harrowing stories of injury and recovery, reveal a surprisingly adept artist doing penance for a great disaster of American history.",
		"12" : "SIGNS FOR LOST CHILDREN, by Sarah Moss. (Europa, paper, $19.) This fine exploration of a marriage between a doctor in Victorian England and her architect husband feels contemporary in its attention to the competing pulls of work and love, highlighted by distance. Tom’s employer sends him to Japan; Ally works in insane asylum in Cornwall; and the novel juxtaposes their individual quests and the effect on their nascent relationship."

		"1" : "MARGARET THATCHER A Life and Legacy By David Cannadine 162 pp. Oxford University, $14.95.",
		"2" : "So much has been said about Margaret Thatcher that the only thing left to do is to say less. Cannadine’s life of the strident and indomitable prime minister is quick as a sprint and a joy to read. Initially prepared as an entry for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Cannadine’s Thatcher appears here in a stand-alone volume of 162 lively pages. In them the author, a prolific biographer and historian, synthesizes decades of scholarship on the most significant figure in British politics since Winston Churchill.",
		"3" : "“Margaret Thatcher: A Life and Legacy” necessarily forgoes detailed chronology for broad strokes. There was the middlebrow upbringing in a provincial English town; the unlikely rise to prime minister (“As in Grantham, Margaret was again living over the shop”); war with the cabinet and the trade unions; solidarity with the United States; conservatism; femininity; glamour; strength; and a brusque and commanding style that put Britain’s patriarchy in its place. Thatcher’s hectoring manner also meant an idle retirement: “There was no possibility of another high-level job, because she had offended too many people and was rightly regarded as an impossible colleague.”",
		"4" : "Cannadine persuasively concludes that Thatcher rivaled Churchill in stature but not achievement. Her convictions and force of personality gave rise to their own movement (Thatcherism), yet her signal foreign policy success was an anachronistic colonial adventure in the Falklands. She helped win the Cold War but was “emphatically on the wrong side of history” in favoring apartheid South Africa and opposing German reunification. Domestically, Thatcher presided over years of unemployment and economic policies that coddled the rich. Yet, like Ronald Reagan, she fundamentally reoriented her country’s politics. Ferocious and bold, Thatcher is a case study as much in willpower as sharpness of tooth.",
		"5" : "PILLARS OF JUSTICE Lawyers and the Liberal Tradition By Owen Fiss 209 pp. Harvard University, $27.95",
		"6" : "In “Pillars of Justice,” Fiss, an eminent constitutional scholar, offers a warm and generous reflection on the men and women who shaped his life in the law. The book collects brief essays on 13 judges, attorneys and law professors who provided inspiration and friendship. The common theme is a reverence for legal liberalism in its various forms: Yale Law School, where Fiss taught for many years; the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, where he began his career after clerking for Justice William Brennan; the “halcyon days of the Warren court”; and Brown v. Board of Education, which Fiss views as the Supreme Court’s key triumph and promise.",
		"7" : "The book contains as much autobiography as portraiture, and it begins with an arresting anecdote. Traveling to Washington, D.C., as a high school student, Fiss visited the court to observe his first oral argument. Who should he see at the lectern but Thurgood Marshall himself, arguing Brown. Marshall is one of three judges profiled here, along with Brennan and the Israeli jurist Aharon Barak. John Doar and Burke Marshall represent the practical idealism of the 1960s Justice Department. In 1963, Doar gained fame by helping to quell a brewing riot in Mississippi after the assassination of Medgar Evers. A photo of that tense moment appears on the book’s cover.",
		"8" : "Fiss’s entries on his fellow scholars, by contrast, can unfortunately veer into small-stakes law school politics, or worse, arcane theories and stale hypotheticals that have little application outside Yale’s lofty walls. Much is made of the clever titles of law review articles. And somewhere between Fiss’s account of “fundamentality without fundamentalism” and the well-worn “ticking time-bomb” scenario to discuss torture, many readers will find their attention wandering. The early chapters of this book are best.",
		"9" : "GEORGE WASHINGTON The Wonder of the Age By John Rhodehamel 353 pp. Yale University, $32.50.",
		"10" : "This biography of the nation’s first president stands out for its rich prose. Rhodehamel writes of Washington’s “legendary courage and his splendid person,” and explains that he possessed “that rare and inexplicable power to make others trust and obey him. Many discovered that they actually loved him.” Rhodehamel’s jaunty writing makes for a highly entertaining book. Here he is on the Continental Army’s surprise attack at the Battle of Trenton: “The Americans charged aggressively, emerging out of the swirling snow. Washington led from the center.” The general’s instinct to find the middle of the action worried his men. It also inspired them.",
		"11" : "Washington’s story benefits from a vigorous telling. The powdered wig, the silly pants, the poker face staring out from crumpled dollar bills: All serve to separate us from our founding father. Rhodehamel’s urgency of prose restores the connection. He also showcases his experience as the former archivist of Mount Vernon by bringing manuscript sources directly to the reader. A fine detail is Washington’s distinctive penmanship. “He learned to write in an imposing hand that is still lovely to see. His lines lay perfectly straight across the paper. He liked elegant capital letters.”",
		"12" : "Rhodehamel contends that a tension between ambition and reluctance to serve produced Washington’s greatness. He eagerly sought out commands early in his career, but he hesitated to assume the presidency and could not wait to be free of it. In office, he used his tremendous prestige to consolidate American nationhood at an uncertain moment. Washington was not perfect: He freed his slaves in his will but had been a lifelong slaveholder; and while he decried partisanship, he himself became a fierce Federalist. Yet even flawed, Washington was both the projection and embodiment of the citizenry’s deepest aspirations."

		"2" : "What books are currently on your night stand?",
		"3" : "My night stand is more like a geological structure: a bunch of books piled on the floor with its own strata. At the top layer are the newly accumulated books. Among the most recent additions are T. C. Boyle’s “The Terranauts,” Zadie Smith’s “Swing Time” and Tana French’s “The Trespasser.” Then comes the layer of books further down, which, for a long time, I’ve been planning to read but have not yet had a chance — though I vow to! These include Renata Adler’s “Speedboat,” Marlon James’s “A Brief History of Seven Killings” and Norman Mailer’s “Harlot’s Ghost.” Finally, there are the books scattered about that I’m continually excavating to look at again for inspiration, such as James Baldwin’s “Collected Essays”; Saul Bellow’s “Seize the Day”; Willa Cather’s “My Ántonia”; Flannery O’Connor’s “The Complete Stories”; George Orwell’s “Homage to Catalonia”; and St. Clair McKelway’s “Reporting at Wit’s End.” The pile is constantly shifting and resettling and, on occasion, toppling.",
		"4" : "What’s the last great book you read?",
		"5" : "Without question “The North Water,” by Ian McGuire. It’s like some weird channeling of Joseph Conrad and Cormac McCarthy, and yet remains its own original work. Even though I’m a slow reader, I read it in two days.",
		"6" : "What’s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time?",
		"7" : "I have lots of gaps in my education, and so I’m often picking up classic books that most people read years ago. I recently read Thomas Pynchon’s “The Crying of Lot 49” for the first time. In truth, I was assigned the book in high school but didn’t understand a word of it. So I picked it up again and was shocked by how accessible and funny it is, and how devilishly it subverts my favorite genre of fiction, the detective novel. Not long ago I also read “Victory,” by Joseph Conrad, after discovering that it was one of Joan Didion’s favorite books. The novel — which is about a man who has spent his life trying to isolate himself from the complications of the world, only to be drawn into its evil — is not without imperfections, but it’s one of the best depictions I’ve read of how humans succumb to a fatal mix of illusions and deceptions.",
		"8" : "What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?",
		"9" : "I’m not well enough read to have a book that no one else has heard of. But an author who deserves wider recognition is John Joseph Mathews, the prose-poet of the Osage Indians, who died in 1979. His books, including his 1934 semi-autobiographical novel, “Sundown,” capture what life was like on the Oklahoma prairie and the traumatic clash between white settlers and Native Americans. He is an exquisite stylist. Everyone should read him.",
		"10" : "Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most?",
		"11" : "Too many to list, but here’s a start: T. C. Boyle, Robert Caro, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Don DeLillo, Joan Didion, Louise Erdrich, Denis Johnson, Jon Krakauer, Erik Larson, Janet Malcolm, Steven Millhauser, Candice Millard, Cynthia Ozick, Ann Patchett, Richard Price, Ron Rosenbaum, Philip Roth (even if he’s no longer writing), Hampton Sides and Colson Whitehead. I’ve also been fortunate to be able to work at The New Yorker, where I admire so many of my colleagues. And I have enormous admiration for newspaper reporters like David A. Fahrenthold and Maggie Haberman who are doing a public service by holding our government officials accountable.",
		"12" : "What’s the last book to make you laugh?",
		"13" : "The author who consistently makes me laugh is Elmore Leonard, who had a perfect ear for American vernacular and who believed, as he put it, “the bad guys are the fun guys.” The book that most recently made me laugh, though, was Junot Díaz’s “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.” The book had been buried in my night stand pile for ages, until last year I finally pulled it out and read it. Not only are the scenes funny; the play of words in each sentence made me laugh. And like the best comic novels, it is really a tragedy.",
		"14" : "The last to make you cry?",
		"15" : "I don’t cry too often reading books, but I did reading Francisco Goldman’s autobiographical novel, “Say Her Name.” Like the author, the protagonist in the book loses his wife during a freakish accident while body surfing in Mexico. Though many books wrestle with guilt and grief and memory, Goldman explores these themes with unflinching honesty and emotional truth.",
		"16" : "The last book that made you furious?",
		"17" : "David Wyman’s “The Abandonment of the Jews,” which meticulously describes how the United States and other countries failed to pursue policies, including more open immigration, that could have saved countless people from extermination during the Holocaust.",
		"18" : "Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?",
		"19" : "Because I read so much nonfiction for work, I enjoy fiction most, especially detective novels and mysteries that keep me awake at night. I’ll read anything by Megan Abbott, Eric Ambler, Kate Atkinson, Michael Connelly, John Grisham and Dashiell Hammett. I don’t instinctively pick up science fiction, but if it’s well written I can easily be swept away.",
		"20" : "How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?",
		"21" : "My mom was a publisher, and I grew up in a house full of hardcover books that still had the smell of freshly printed paper, and to this day I love to collect first editions by authors I admire. Yet I now have rather poor eyesight, and reading electronically — and being able to triple the font size — has been a modern wonder. As for my reading habits, they’re rather strange and inexplicable. I won’t read two novels at the same time, or two nonfiction books at the same time. It feels like a betrayal. However, I will often read one nonfiction book and one novel during the same period — though I usually read the former during the day and the latter during the night.",
		"22" : "How do you organize your books?",
		"23" : "Disastrously. And as my house has filled with children and pets and their accouterments I’ve had to start storing books in boxes in my basement, and sometimes even in the garage, where they have acquired a rather foul odor.",
		"24" : "What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?",
		"25" : "The only really surprising stuff comes from my research: books on the hunt for the giant squid, or hangings in the Old West, or what it’s like to be eaten by maggots in the jungle.",
		"26" : "What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift?",
		"27" : "“The Eitingons: A Twentieth-Century Story,” by Mary-Kay Wilmers, which my mother gave me. Wilmers, who is the editor of The London Review of Books, is a distant relative and delved deeply into the gothic history of our family, which included a member of Sigmund Freud’s inner circle and apparently a notorious K.G.B. assassin.",
		"28" : "Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?",
		"29" : "My favorite fictional hero is Dr. Watson, because unlike Sherlock Holmes, he bumbles through life like the rest of us; my favorite villain is the pig Napoleon in “Animal Farm,” who embodies the evil of absolute political power.",
		"30" : "What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?",
		"31" : "I didn’t become much of a reader until junior high, when I discovered the novels by S. E. Hinton. I raced through them, then stumbled upon Robert Cormier’s “I Am the Cheese,” which has a twist at the end that still haunts me. Many of the books that were assigned in class — “A Separate Peace,” “The Catcher in the Rye,” “Go Tell It on the Mountain,” “Their Eyes Were Watching God” — all still stick with me, perhaps because I was more impressionable then or perhaps because my memory was still firing on all cylinders.",
		"32" : "If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?",
		"33" : "Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.” It gives a sense of the fragility of the world. Plus, each sentence is very short — about the length of a tweet.",
		"34" : "You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?",
		"35" : "I’ll go with Thomas Pynchon, because I can dine on that for the rest of my life; Ambrose Bierce, because I can then solve the riddle of his death; and Margot Livesey, who is a wonderful novelist and the best writing teacher I ever had.",
		"36" : "Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?",
		"37" : "There was a time in my life when, if I started a book, I was determined to finish it. I still remember my misery getting to the end of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged.” In recent years, I’ve become more coldhearted and will often quickly ditch a book I don’t like — yet I’m not so coldhearted to name names.",
		"38" : "Whom would you want to write your bio?",
		"39" : "Janet Malcolm once compared the biographer to a “professional burglar, breaking into a house, rifling through certain drawers that he has good reason to think contain the jewelry and money, and triumphantly bearing his loot away.” So I’m going to lock the doors and keep away anyone who wants to write my life story.",
		"40" : "What do you plan to read next?",
		"41" : "Well, I was planning on finally tackling Mailer’s tome “Harlot’s Ghost,” but thankfully my 10-year-old daughter, Ella, gave me a reprieve and picked my next book: “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which we plan to read together."

		"1" : "MERCIES IN DISGUISE A Story of Hope, a Family’s Genetic Destiny, and the Science That Rescued Them By Gina Kolata 262 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $25.99.",
		"2" : "THE FAMILY GENE A Mission to Turn My Deadly Inheritance Into a Hopeful Future By Joselin Linder 261 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $28.99.",
		"3" : "If life can be a Hobbesian trial — “nasty, brutish and short” — then for adults with rare genetic diseases, life can sometimes be nasty, brutish and long. Take the ordinary difficulties of getting through the day and add, for example, loss of motor function, a deteriorating memory or a blocked vein in the liver and a body so swollen with lymphatic fluid that clothes and shoes no longer fit. Now throw in lack of a diagnosis and dwindling financial resources.",
		"4" : "While the precipitous drop in the cost of DNA sequencing has helped many rare-disease patients and their families find answers they could not have only a few years ago, many more continue to embark on protracted “diagnostic odysseys” involving expensive visits with one flummoxed specialist after another. The unexplained disease brings shame, denial and sometimes blame. Along the way patients ask: Why me? It is both an existential question and a basic human desire to know oneself — to understand what is happening to one’s body. Such knowledge might lead to a treatment for, or at least, better management of the condition.",
		"5" : "The narratives of families suffering from such diseases traffic in these questions and a roiling stew of emotions: confusion, anger, determination, resilience, love, and moments of profound despair and hope. The seeming scarcity of the last asset — hope — can make books like Gina Kolata’s “Mercies in Disguise” and Joselin Linder’s “The Family Gene” hard to read: We know at the outset that many of the characters and some of their loved ones either carry or are at risk of carrying glitches in their DNA that will cause them anguish and most likely fell them before their time.",
		"6" : "In these two books we hear again and again about people who have — or fear they have — “the gene for” a devastating disease. I confess that my inner geneticist chafes at this language — by and large, we all have the same 22,000 or so genes. Some of us have differing versions of those genes — a particular DNA mutation or variant in a gene that causes disease, for example — but not a distinct “gene for.” Without the descriptor “mutated” in front of the word gene or “variant” after it, it’s a bit like saying “I have an engine for a faulty timing belt.” That said, I recognize that the usage battle is probably lost; moreover, after reading these books, one can hardly blame the authors for such language, given how little modern medicine has had to offer the families they write about — “gene for” connotes an inevitability that, sadly, remains far too apt. Despite this, and as the subtitles suggest, both books contain a welcome measure of hope — they are not merely medical procedurals that end with diagnoses and death, but family stories fraught with difficult choices and palpable compassion.",
		"7" : "In “Mercies in Disguise,” Kolata, a veteran science writer for The Times, tells the story of the Baxleys, longstanding pillars of Hartsville, S.C. Bill, the pater familias and a chemical engineer, is increasingly bewildered by simple tasks like opening a package of crackers. “Something is wrong with Dad,” his son Mike says. We eventually learn that the something is Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disorder whose mechanism baffled scientists for decades. G.S.S. belongs to a family of diseases that includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the human version of “mad cow” disease) and fatal familial insomnia (described in heartbreaking detail by D. T. Max in 2006’s “The Family That Couldn’t Sleep”). Kolata takes a couple of detours into the history of the competitive quest to understand how these adult-onset diseases are caused by infectious proteins that start with a mutated gene and how they leave patients’ brains riddled with microscopic holes. These excursions are a useful reminder of both the ego-driven ambitions that so often propel scientific discovery (in this case, the payoff was two Nobel Prizes) and how remote such discoveries usually are from the development of effective treatments.",
		"8" : "Bill Baxley’s four sons — two of whom are physicians — struggle to understand what happened to their father and to come to terms with their own inherited risk. As Kolata frames it: Would you want to know if you carried a fatal gene mutation? Not everyone does. The second half of “Mercies in Disguise” brings this abstraction to life through the eyes of the Baxley granddaughter Amanda and her sister Holly, whose father, Buddy, succumbed to G.S.S. like his father, Bill, before him. The deeply religious Holly rejects genetic testing for G.S.S. and declares that, in this case, hope and knowledge are mutually exclusive. “While I don’t know, I have hope.” For Amanda, on the other hand, knowledge is power, even if this particular bit of knowledge is incomplete and frightening and the power it confers is uncertain at best.",
		"9" : "“Mercies in Disguise” is at its strongest when it wrestles with the stark realities of rare disease. Amanda’s story presents an unflinching look at the financial hardships (likely to be exacerbated by any repeal or weakening of the Affordable Care Act’s exemption of pre-existing conditions), indifferent medical institutions, abortion politics and the way delicate family dynamics are complicated by the prospect of a debilitating condition that strikes otherwise vigorous healthy people.",
		"10" : "In “The Family Gene,” Joselin Linder describes her father’s mysterious illness beginning with nonspecific symptoms — puffy ankles, a heart murmur— through an accelerated decline culminating in the accumulation of massive amounts of a milky-looking, fatty lymph fluid in his abdomen that has left his organs “practically fused together.” As far as anyone knows, this collection of features has never been seen outside of her family. The narrative thus becomes a mix of family history, medical detective story and memoir.",
		"11" : "Her father, a physician, is both a diligent observer of his own failing health and a cantankerous patient who is infuriated by it. His last words to his daughter are an expletive; Joselin doesn’t take it personally. In addition to bestowing unconditional love on her dying father, she is busy negotiating her own health along with adulthood and all of its accouterments: feckless and sometimes tragic boyfriends, punk bands, dead-end jobs, and an ample supply of booze and cigarettes. It is this lack of sentiment that, in part, makes “The Family Gene” both congenial and engaging, despite the long shadow of a broken gene.",
		"12" : "Early on Linder finds someone willing to make an abiding commitment to figuring out her family’s wonky lymphatic system and strange constellation of complaints. The Harvard cardiologist and geneticist Christine (Dr. Kricket) Seidman periodically brings the Linders to her laboratory to take family histories, run tests, look for mutations and, perhaps most important, dispense a bit of bedside manner; after Linder undergoes a surgical procedure to unblock her hepatic vein, Seidman sends her flowers. Dr. Kricket is an empathetic embodiment of the blurry reality for rare-disease patients like Joselin Linder: Research and clinical care can be hard to distinguish from one another — maybe sometimes we shouldn’t bother trying.",
		"13" : "“The Family Gene” is occasionally beset by incorrect explanations of the science. BRCA1, for example, is not a gene variant as Linder describes it, but rather a gene that can harbor any one of hundreds of rare variants, or DNA spelling errors, that dramatically raise a woman’s risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. For its part, “Mercies in Disguise” sometimes suffers from a general humorlessness and heavy-handed prose (“Now he felt for the first time the wallop of tragedy”). But did I cry anyway? Yes — twice. In the end, these stories are less about didactic scientific explanations or transcendent language and more about how human beings respond to immensely challenging ailments that we don’t understand very well if at all.",
		"14" : "Yes, there is hope here, but it is hard-won. The overarching lesson that came from the completion of the Human Genome Project was that DNA is not destiny. But too often, for those living with untreatable inherited conditions, it can still feel that way."

		"2" : "SPAIN IN OUR HEARTS: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939, by Adam Hochschild. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.99.) Hochschild, the author of “King Leopold’s Ghost,” structures this account of the conflict as a collective biography of Americans who fought for the Republican side. He investigates the romantic appeal of the cause and the reasons for its failure.",
		"3" : "HYSTOPIA, by David Means. (Picador, $18.) In this novel within a novel — framed as a manuscript by a fictional Vietnam veteran, Eugene Allen, written shortly before he committed suicide — John F. Kennedy is entering his third term as president and has founded a program, the Psych Corps, to treat traumatized soldiers. Allen’s story centers on two corps agents who have fallen in love and set off to recover a young woman who has been abducted.",
		"4" : "LOUISA: The Extraordinary Life of Mrs. Adams, by Louisa Thomas. (Penguin, $18.) Born in London, the woman who married John Quincy Adams lived across Europe with her family, then her diplomat husband, before coming to the United States. These experiences helped set her apart, as did the trove of writing she left behind. Thomas draws on Louisa’s memoirs, travelogues and extensive correspondence to offer a rich interior portrait.",
		"5" : "FOR A LITTLE WHILE: New and Selected Stories, by Rick Bass. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $18.99.) In this collection of tales, humans act on their animal natures, and the natural world is suffused with the holy; in one story, an ice storm and powerful arctic front leads a dog trainer and her client to an encounter with the sublime. As our reviewer, Smith Henderson, put it, Bass, “a master of the short form,” writes not only “to save our wild places, but to save what’s wild and humane and best within us.”",
		"6" : "YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice, by Tom Vanderbilt. (Vintage, $16.95.) Vanderbilt, a journalist, has written a guide to the invisible forces shaping personal preferences — and the companies trying desperately to understand, and profit from, taste. Taste is both contextual and categorical, he argues, leading to a baffling capriciousness in what people like and why.",
		"7" : "ELIGIBLE, by Curtis Sittenfeld. (Random House, $17.) A retelling of “Pride and Prejudice” unfolds in the Cincinnati suburbs: Liz, a magazine writer in New York, comes home to find her family in disarray, and meets Darcy, now in the guise of a neurosurgeon from San Francisco who is profoundly underwhelmed by the Midwest. Sittenfeld’s version seamlessly transplants Jane Austen’s story to a modern American setting."

		"1" : "The path that led Michael Ruhlman to Ann Hood began in 1988 at the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference in Vermont.",
		"2" : "“I saw Ann, who had already established herself as a great writer, walking down a path, arm-in-arm, with two other novelists,” Mr. Ruhlman recalled. “At the time, I was an aspiring writer trying to ingratiate myself with as many novel and fiction writers as I could.”",
		"3" : "So he decided to call out her name and tell her just that.",
		"4" : "“I just sort of yelled ‘Ann Hood’ in her direction,” Mr. Ruhlman said. “I don’t know why I did it, I just did.”",
		"5" : "Ms. Hood, who a year earlier had written her first novel, the best-selling “Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine,” turned toward Mr. Ruhlman with a puzzled look.",
		"6" : "“Well, what do you want to do?” she asked after their brief and awkward introduction.",
		"7" : "“I want to write fiction,” he replied.",
		"8" : "She stared at him for a moment, and the pieces of her puzzled face began forming a bright smile. Then came a two-word prophecy.",
		"9" : "“You will,” she told him before moving on.",
		"10" : "They would return to their own paths that would not cross again for 20 years, though Mr. Ruhlman, now 53, continued to maintain what he called “a literary crush” on Ms. Hood, now 60.",
		"11" : "“I didn’t know her to actually love her, but over the years, I fell in love with everything about her writing,” he said. “In the back of my mind, I always remembered how she inspired me on that path in Vermont.”",
		"12" : "Two decades later, Ms. Hood and Mr. Ruhlman met again in Cleveland, at a 2008 weekend writers’ conference where both were scheduled to speak.",
		"13" : "By then, Ms. Hood was married with two children and had written other best-selling books, as well as numerous short stories and magazine articles. She was also teaching creative writing courses while splitting time between homes in Providence, R.I., and Manhattan.",
		"14" : "Mr. Ruhlman, a Duke graduate, had established himself as a nonfiction writer who collaborated with chefs to produce books like “The Making of a Chef” (1997) and “The Reach of a Chef” (2006).",
		"15" : "As she waited for her turn to speak, Ms. Hood noticed what she described as “a very, very good-looking man” walking into the room.",
		"16" : "“I said to my friend: ‘Who is that guy? He’s really cute,’” Ms. Hood recalled.",
		"17" : "Ms. Hood, who did not recall meeting Mr. Ruhlman 20 years earlier, will never forget what happened next.",
		"18" : "“The same cute guy I was asking about gets up in this crowded room filled with influential writers, and says, ‘I’m a little nervous today because Ann Hood is in the audience, and I’ve been in love with her since 1988.’”",
		"19" : "Later, Mr. Ruhlman was signing one of his books when he looked up at the next person in line and saw Ms. Hood standing there.",
		"20" : "“He kind of jumped up when he saw me,” she said. “I joked with him a bit, saying that, typically, I would usually know if someone had a crush on me for 20 years.”",
		"21" : "Before their paths diverged once more, Mr. Ruhlman said to Ms. Hood, “The next time you’re in Cleveland, give me a call and I’ll cook dinner for you.”",
		"22" : "Ms. Hood laughed.",
		"23" : "“I knew I would never be in Cleveland again,” she said. “So we exchanged books and email addresses and said our goodbyes.”",
		"24" : "But they managed to stay in touch, chatting on occasion via email and text, each learning a little bit more about the other with every press of a send button.",
		"25" : "Ms. Hood, born in West Warwick, R.I., grew up with a passion for telling her own stories.",
		"26" : "“When I was a kid, 12, 13 and 14 years old, living in my little tiny town in Rhode Island and dreaming of being a writer, I used to sit on my bed and listen to Simon and Garfunkel,” she said. “They had a song called ‘The Dangling Conversation’; it’s actually a very depressing song, but there’s a line in it that goes, ‘You read your Emily Dickinson and I my Robert Frost,’ and I used to think that someday I’m going to meet a guy who loves poetry like I do, and we are going to talk about Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson.”",
		"27" : "Along the way to reaching her goals, Ms. Hood made a few detours. After graduating from the University of Rhode Island, she worked as a T.W.A. flight attendant from 1978 to 1986, living in Boston, St. Louis and New York.",
		"28" : "“I went from asking people if they wanted beef or chicken for dinner to writing best-selling novels and attending the most incredible book parties ever,” said Ms. Hood, who was still at T.W.A. when she earned a master’s degree in American literature at New York University.",
		"29" : "But her own story was not without tragedy. In 2002, her 5-year-old daughter, Grace, died from a virulent form of strep, driving Ms. Hood into a depression so dark that she could not write a sentence for a year.",
		"30" : "She began coping with the pain through long knitting sessions and expressed her grief the best way she knew how — through her powerful prose.",
		"31" : "In 2006, Ms. Hood wrote about her daughter’s death in a Modern Love column for The New York Times.",
		"32" : "Mr. Ruhlman recalled breaking down in tears when he read the column. “I cannot imagine losing a child and the pain and suffering that goes along with that,” said Mr. Ruhlman, a native of Cleveland who raised a daughter and a son there with his wife.",
		"33" : "In fall 2014, another of Ms. Hood’s books, “An Italian Wife,” had just been published. In an attempt to help promote it, Ms. Hood’s publicist asked her if she knew of any food writer who might be willing to take Ms. Hood out to an Italian restaurant to interview her about her Italian roots and her grandmother’s cooking.",
		"34" : "She asked Mr. Ruhlman, who gladly accepted.",
		"35" : "She was living in Providence at that time — three years after Grace’s death, Ms. Hood and her husband had adopted a daughter, Annabelle — and he was still in Cleveland. But they discovered they had studio apartments in Manhattan that were a block apart.",
		"36" : "They met at a West Village restaurant, where the interview did not go exactly as hoped — in fact, it was better.",
		"37" : "“The food was terrible and the place was noisy, but the company was delightful,” Ms. Hood said. “We knew that we were kindred spirits that first night.”",
		"38" : "Indeed, when Ms. Hood asked Mr. Ruhlman if he could recite any poem verbatim, he chose “Fire and Ice” by Frost.",
		"39" : "“It was literally a dream come true,” said Ms. Hood, her voice beginning to crack. “A feeling just rushed over me, like I was hit by a tsunami.”",
		"40" : "Later that week, Ms. Hood was giving a reading at the Italian American Museum in Little Italy, and Mr. Ruhlman returned to take her out to another restaurant for a do-over of the interview.",
		"41" : "The morning after, Ms. Hood left a phone message for Mr. Ruhlman in which she recited Dickinson’s “There’s a Certain Slant of Light.”",
		"42" : "That served “to sort of fulfill the prophecy,” Mr. Ruhlman said. “I began to feel as if I had known her my whole life.”",
		"43" : "The next week, Mr. Ruhlman had his first work of fiction — a collection of novellas called “In Short Measures,” sold to a publisher, bringing to fruition Ms. Hood’s prophecy.",
		"44" : "And now he was living out yet another dream: being friends with his longtime literary crush.",
		"45" : "By spring 2016, both Ms. Hood and Mr. Ruhlman were divorced. On Dec. 9, Ms. Hood’s birthday, Mr. Ruhlman asked her to marry him, “sooner, rather than later,” he said.",
		"46" : "“We knew what we had from the start, so why wait?” he said. “We have both lost close friends, some of them in their 50s, so we know that life can be too short — we shouldn’t allow ourselves to believe that it is still early morning, when’s it’s actually late in the afternoon.”",
		"47" : "They were married on April 20 on an overcast day at Abingdon Square in Manhattan, with a few relatives and friends on hand.",
		"48" : "Laura Lippman, the crime-writing novelist and a longtime friend of Ms. Hood, became a Universal Life minister to officiate. She told those assembled, “This is an occasion born of a particular postponement, of years lived and miles spanned, only to circle back to that path in Vermont where a man called a woman’s name and she turned and responded to his greeting.”",
		"49" : "Ms. Hood read “Master Speed” by Frost.",
		"50" : "Two such as you with such a master speed Cannot be parted nor be swept away.",
		"51" : "Her daughter, Annabelle, read Dickinson’s “Hope Is the Thing With Feathers.”",
		"52" : "That perches in the soul —",
		"53" : "And sings the tune without the words —",
		"54" : "And never stops —",
		"55" : "at all",
		"56" : "After the ceremony, Mr. Ruhlman took Ms. Hood by the hand and they traveled their first path together as husband and wife, making their way through the city streets, past construction workers and honking horns on their way to the reception at Barbuto, a restaurant several blocks away.",
		"57" : "Following behind were their guests, including Ms. Hood’s mother, Gloria Hood; her son, Sam; and Annabelle. Mr. Ruhlman was trailed by his mother, Carole Ruhlman; and son, James.",
		"58" : "Mr. Ruhlman said of Ms. Hood: “I get the sense that from the moment I was born, I started knowing her. There is the platonic notion of love in which Plato postulated that one soul is separated from the other at birth and they each spend the rest of their lives searching for the other half.",
		"59" : "“Well, if that’s true,” he said, “then I’ve finally found the soul I’ve been searching for.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "When I was 12, shortly after I joined a youth-basketball team, my father summoned me to the living room. He was holding a set of VHS tapes called “Pistol Pete’s Homework Basketball,” which he thought might help me get ready for the coming season. Naturally, I was dubious. In what sense could basketball be considered homework? And who was Pistol Pete Maravich anyway? With the solemnity that other fathers adopt when passing down heirloom rifles, Dad handed me the tapes and said, “Just watch.”",
		"2" : "I popped the first one into the VCR, but Maravich’s appearance did little to curb my skepticism. Gawky and bird-thin, he wore a Chicago-cop mustache and spoke in the gentle exhortations of a youth pastor. “Practice, practice, practice,” he said, shaking a finger at the camera. “Remember: Don’t forget to do your homework.” What I didn’t know at the time was that Maravich was a legend; he set the scoring record in the N.C.A.A. and made five trips to the N.B.A. All-Star Game throughout the 1970s. But he was most famous for his on-court wizardry, for his nimble behind-the-back passes and persuasive head-fakes that made even the most adroit defenders look ornamental and weak.",
		"3" : "“Homework Basketball,” which was released in 1987, started with lessons on the fundamentals, like shooting and dribbling. But as the videos went on, Maravich began to initiate his young viewers into a more esoteric set of skills. “I’m also going to teach you today how to do the creative — the more advanced — type of pass, the artistic type of pass.” The video then furnished a bevy of drills whose names sounded like dance moves that you would execute only at a wedding: “Different Strokes,” “Scrambled Eggs,” “The Laid-Back.” Alone in the penumbral glow of the gym, Maravich pirouetted across the hardwood, schooling invisible foes with breakneck sleights of hand. Again and again, I rewound the trick-shot sequence, watching as Maravich leapt into the air and looped the ball between his legs before completing a reverse layup.",
		"4" : "Throughout that basketball season, I rose before dawn to begin my regimen. In the gloom of the driveway, I followed the Pistol’s workout, lassoing the ball between my legs (sometimes wearing a blindfold). Then I rehearsed behind-the-back passes, first with my right arm, then with my left, aiming for a bull’s-eye I had painted on the wall of our garage. My efforts were downright monastic — asceticism in the service of its opposite.",
		"5" : "Yet whenever I applied Maravich’s instructions to actual games, my coaches grimaced at the theatrics. Occasionally it would work out: I still recall faking a behind-the-back pass and juking my opponent, only to retract the ball and flip it against the backboard for an uncontested layup. But just as often my glitzy passes veered into the hands of waiting defenders. So enamored was I with the aesthetic possibilities of the sport, I overlooked the simple urgency of competition. Eventually, my flashiness earned me a spot on the bench and, once I got to high school, a berth on the J.V. squad.",
		"6" : "Now in my early 30s, I rarely play basketball anymore, fearful as I am of shredding an ankle or mangling a knee. These days, if Pistol Pete’s videos remain “instructional” for me, it’s because they insist that glimmers of artistry can live, however briefly, in activities we might otherwise regard as brute and mechanistic. A friend of mine claims that he cannot watch sports because their simplistic teleology — putting a ball in a basket, lobbing a puck into a goal — distills “the futility of the whole human experience.” Sports, for him, expose the extent to which all of us are obsessively zeroed in on the next mark, the next burst of glory, all of which will be swiftly and inexorably forgotten. But it’s not the primal exigencies of winning that compel my attention. Rather, it’s those moments when something unexpected, something artful, flashes out of the roil of bodies in space.",
		"7" : "On certain days, I’ll jog past a public park where scrums of 20-somethings hotfoot across the concrete and will feel an odd twinge in the gut. One recent afternoon, I actually summoned the courage to join them. On a fast-break, something miraculous happened. I caught an outlet pass and, blazing across center court, I was momentarily overcome by the ghost of that boy — the kid toiling in his driveway — at which point I dished a no-look pass through a defender’s legs and hit my teammate midstride, who finished things off with a balletic dunk. Heads turned. Teammates said, O.K., O.K.!",
		"8" : "This is what will be remembered, I thought, when the ground takes us back. The score will be forgotten, but what will endure are those rare moments when the plodding human body escaped its mortal form and entered, if only for a second, the realm of grace.",
		"9" : "At 40, not long after he released the videos, Pistol Pete Maravich died during a game of pickup basketball. Unknown to anyone, Maravich included, he was born with a rare heart defect that left him without a left coronary artery. Cardiologists who reviewed his autopsy were flummoxed that he managed to play basketball for so long. In light of this knowledge, I find it tempting to read retroactively into his career a kind of gorgeous desperation, to wonder whether, on some level, he felt the burden of his truncated fate, a questing urge to linger in the spotlight while it was still his."

		"1" : "Jessica B. Harris stepped out of her pink cottage in New Orleans and into the sun. She took the stairs carefully, in gold boat shoes, her shoulders draped in flowing fabric, a Zuni necklace of tiny multicolored animals swaying around her neck.",
		"2" : "“Being a little old lady is less than advertised,” she said. But Harris, who is 69, is not really a little old lady. She’s a professor of English at Queens College who spring-breaks in New Orleans; a culinary historian and a witty, in-demand lecturer; and the author of a dozen cookbooks on the foods of the African diaspora. For years, her work has shaped my understanding of American cuisine, and I was so nervous to meet her that I practiced introducing myself just before I pulled up to her home. Good morning, Dr. Harris? Oh-my-God-hi!",
		"3" : "Harris’s new book, “My Soul Looks Back,” out next month, is her first memoir. Its focus is New York in the 1970s and early ’80s, when Harris lived in the West Village and her social circle included some of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century — James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Paule Marshall and Toni Morrison. Harris was a successful teacher and journalist, a rising star, but in her early days, among so much glamour, she felt like an outsider. For two days in Abidjan, on the Ivory Coast, she found herself both frenemy and fixer to Nina Simone. In Saint Paul-de-Vence, in the South of France, Harris spent a week at Baldwin’s home, where he read to her, out loud, from start to finish, an early draft of his novel “If Beale Street Could Talk.”",
		"4" : "That week, Harris ate lamb and baked tomatoes, ratatouille and boeuf en daube. Outside, by the cypress trees in Baldwin’s garden, under clear blue skies, she ate soupe au pistou. The Provençal soup was simple: vegetables cut bite-size, simmered in broth, cheered up with plenty of garlicky pesto, dropped directly into each bowl.",
		"5" : "“You should know, I’m pretty much incapable of following a recipe, including my own,” Harris said as we leaned over her recipe for her book. She wrote the recipe for the memoir using a mix of research and memory, but she’d cook it the way she liked to cook, in the moment, following her own senses, not a list.",
		"6" : "Soupe au pistou is well suited to Harris’s spontaneous, unfussy approach to cooking. It’s country food, adjusted endlessly to make use of whatever’s around, easily doubled to feed a crowd. Traditionally it was a summer dish. You made it when the basil came up. Now basil is everywhere, all the time. Make soupe au pistou in the spring, go on through the summer and week to week your pot can still show you how time passes, from fresh favas and summer squash to corn and green beans.",
		"7" : "At the Crescent City Farmers Market, Harris took her time, looping the stalls before settling on what to buy, then reaching for pretty much everything that looked good. This included fat white turnips (which she referred to all day as “the turnips that devoured Cleveland”), snap peas, yellow summer squash and tiny, thin-skinned red potatoes. She picked up a few pints of local blueberries to have for dessert with whipped cream sweetened with cane syrup, and a loaf of bread for the platter of cheese she planned to put out before dessert. “I never met a stinky, runny cheese I didn’t love,” she said.",
		"8" : "Back in Harris’s kitchen, which gleamed with vintage copper, I was on chopping duty, peeling and slicing vegetables on a dollhouse cutting board the size of my hand. Harris put Cesária Évora on the speakers in the next room and opened a bottle of her favorite rosé. “You good?” she asked, if she noticed me hesitate. “Phooey,” she said, if something wasn’t right. Harris sweated carrots and leeks in a tall copper pot. The sweet white turnips went in, along with their greens, and Harris got to work setting a table in her living room. “I’m a social cook,” she said, moving books out of the way to make room for a pink tablecloth and antique glasses. At the market, earlier, she reached for her phone, in its Tweety Bird case, and called some friends over. “I know it’s last minute, but I’ve got a wonderful surprise,” she told them. “I’m making a soupe au pistou.”",
		"9" : "By 7, friends were at her door, with gifts of homemade lemon curd and cold wine and a handful of gardenias. Harris added pasta and squash to the pot and let it bubble while she caught up with them. Off the heat, she stirred in a big spoonful of pesto, and the broth turned a beautiful bright green. Harris took a seat at the head of the table, surrounded by friends, and raised a glass.",

		"1" : "Do you know Anne Shirley? You would like her. Everybody does. A lively and optimistic survivor with a feverish imagination and unchecked enthusiasms, she is a redheaded outsider who becomes an insider without forsaking her peculiarities or her intelligence. An inadvertent feminist, an unrepentant romantic, a hot-tempered sprite, she’s impulsive, she’s dramatic, she’s smart, she’s funny, she insists on spelling her name with an E at the end because it “looks so much nicer.” She speaks in exclamation marks and italics even when in the “depths of despair,” which, as an abused child, she knows a thing or two about. She is perpetually seeking “kindred spirits.” She loves trees and stories and nut-brown hair and will burn whatever is in the oven while dreaming about trees and stories and nut-brown hair. She can heal an infant with the croup, but she “cannot tie [herself] down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing” at “thrilling” moments or be asked to eat anything “so unromantic [as boiled pork and beans] when one is in affliction.” She is small and freckled and indefatigable. She is nearly 110 years old.",
		"2" : "Anne Shirley is the heroine of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s beloved 1908 novel, “Anne of Green Gables,” the chronicle of a spirited but previously unloved orphan taken into the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, by the unmarried, middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over a period of years and a nearly endless series of scrapes — falling off roofs, dyeing her hair green, accidentally intoxicating her best friend — Anne transforms the hearts of everyone around her while making a home for herself. The book has sold over 50 million copies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Polish resistance fighters took “Green Gables” with them to the front; the novel became a part of the Japanese school curriculum in the orphan-filled postwar 1950s; a television show based on the series aired in Sri Lanka; and the book occupies a pre-eminent place in Canada, where “Green Gables” is taught in school and featured on postage stamps — a cultural export matched only by hockey and the Mounties. While contemporaneous tales of motherless girls, like “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” “Pollyanna” and “A Little Princess” have faded from popular memory, Anne has thrived, continuing to connect with audiences as she did with Mark Twain, who once described her as “the dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice.”",
		"3" : "Anne is also, to use the blunt jargon of the entertainment business, a strong female character with a pre-existing fan base who recently entered the public domain: an adaptation waiting to happen — again. The novel and its seven Montgomery-penned sequels have already spawned a silent movie, a talkie and more than half a dozen TV shows, including the particularly adored 1985 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series starring Megan Follows as Anne and a recently aired PBS version staring Martin Sheen as Matthew. There is also a Japanese anime; a Canadian cartoon; multiple musicals, including Canada’s longest-running one; an authorized prequel novel; and the entire bustling branch of the Canadian tourism industry that is the Anne-obsessed summer season in P.E.I. Starting next month, Netflix, in collaboration with the CBC, will air “Anne With an E,” the latest reimagining of “Anne of Green Gables” — this time as an ambitious TV drama.",
		"4" : "“Anne With an E” is being overseen, written and co-produced by Moira Walley-Beckett, a “Breaking Bad” writer from Canada who also created “Flesh and Bone,” a 2015 Starz series about the physically and mentally brutal field of ballet. Walley-Beckett won an Emmy for writing “Ozymandias,” the watch-through-your-fingers episode of “Breaking Bad” in which the heroic cop Hank Schrader is slaughtered in the New Mexican desert because of his brother-in-law, the meth lord Walter White. This may seem like a counterintuitive credit for someone updating “Anne of Green Gables,” but it is a signal of the project’s aspirations. Walley-Beckett wants to bring the long-term psychological explorations, story arcs and heady themes of virtuosic TV, as well as its production values, to bear on the lighthearted, primarily episodic novel.",
		"5" : "What this means in practice is that the cheerful novel has, in Walley-Beckett’s hands, become much darker. Extrapolating from asides in the text, Walley-Beckett has fleshed out minor characters; given major ones back stories; drawn out themes of gender parity, prejudice, isolation and bullying; and emphasized the trauma of Anne’s childhood. On Anne’s first journey to Green Gables in the new TV show, she is still, as in the book, so overcome by the beauty of a drive thick with apple trees in bloom that she renames it “the White Way of Delight.” But in an invention of the show, she is also overcome by memories of being beaten by her former employer. The resulting seven-episode season, the first of a hoped-for five, all based on the first novel, is an amalgam of that which is expected from Anne Shirley (her buoyancy) and that which makes for prestigious television today (her depths).",
		"6" : "If you begin to ask why Anne has remained popular for as long as she has, you will get multiple explanations and a bounty of adjectives: She’s curious. She’s hopeful. She’s optimistic. She’s timeless. She’s ahead of her time. She’s imperfect, but perfectly so. She is easy to love. Everything about Anne — her disposition, her gender, her age, her provenance — is a rarity for acclaimed television. Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Hannah Horvath and the rest of the antihero litany are infamously challenging to love, while Anne’s appeal is as plain as the freckles on her face. When I mentioned to Walley-Beckett that Anne is a straightforwardly winning character, her initial reaction was to defend her as if from an undermining charge. “Oh, she has got some antihero stuff, which is fun,” Walley-Beckett said. “She’s not classically beautiful, and she has a bad temper, and she can be heedless.” But then she agreed that yes, “she is a highly lovable and yummy pleasure to sit down with at night.”",
		"7" : "When Walley-Beckett says that Anne has some antiheroic traits, she is not denigrating Anne’s charms. She is making a claim for Anne’s importance in the terms of our television moment, when antiheroes are seen as self-evidently fascinating but a resilient teenage girl who has been adored for over a century might be dismissed as kid’s stuff. Walley-Beckett is, needless to say, hoping that “Anne With an E” will be meaningful to children, and especially young women, but she is very explicit about refusing to pander to them. “My bottom line is: Go deep and make the show worthy of watching,” she says. “There are other versions of ‘Anne’ out there for 5-year-olds.”",
		"8" : "With her TV series, Walley-Beckett is trying to solve a riddle: If everything about “Anne of Green Gables” is what prestige TV usually avoids, how do you adapt it in a way that is both sufficiently sophisticated and yet not a betrayal of the source material? Can Anne Shirley, the yummy pleasure who has flourished by cheerfully gliding above her trauma, be transformed into an almost-antiheroine who, in the fashion of contemporary television, has to grapple with her awful past directly? And can she do so while remaining quintessentially Anne?",
		"9" : "In late November, on the outskirts of Toronto, inside an exacting historical recreation of an 1890s P.E.I. farmhouse — itself within an old gum factory — strings of apples, cut carefully into rings, appeared to be drying above a cast-iron stove. Oatmeal-colored laundry rested on a rack beside it. Canned fruits, dilly beans, baskets of parsnips, brussels sprouts and russet potatoes were among the fare in a fully stocked pantry. Dark wood desks were filled with letters ready to be mailed, addressed using quill and ink. Outside the green front door, after a small porch gave way to a yard but before that yard gave way to the poured-concrete floor of the factory, the earth was red. Crushed bricks had been rolled out like a rusty red carpet, the color of the iron-rich sandstone soil of Prince Edward Island.",
		"10" : "“Anne With an E” was filmed briefly on P.E.I. but spent the majority of its six-month shoot at two locations in Ontario: the gum factory for interiors and a farmstead outside the small city of Pickering for exteriors. At the farmstead, the crew painted and stripped the barn; turned its main floor into a hayloft; sank its electric wires underground; fenced in the paddock; added a porch, a roof and an attic onto the farmhouse; and planted a tall tree — now dead but stapled with a smattering of autumnal leaves — just outside, so Anne would have the cherry tree mentioned in the novel to stare at reverently from her bedroom window.",
		"11" : "Walley-Beckett, who has lived in Los Angeles for the last two decades but was born and raised in and around Vancouver, is meticulous in the way of many accomplished creative people, whose imaginations are matched only by a fanatical patience for detail work. She is so devoted to giving Anne what she called a “documentary feel” that she assured me the potatoes in Marilla’s pantry were period accurate. (They were smaller than supermarket behemoths but otherwise unremarkable.) She insisted on making room in the budget for a 10-foot-long burbling creek, built behind a schoolhouse also constructed from scratch, because the novel mentions that Anne and her fellow students put their milk bottles in a brook to “keep it cool and sweet until the dinner hour,” an evocative detail Walley-Beckett said she “couldn’t do without.”",
		"12" : "Yet, on this November morning, Walley-Beckett was settled into a director’s chair inside Matthew Cuthbert’s bedroom, full of the period, right-angled wood furniture that hurts your back just to look at it, watching as Amybeth McNulty, the 15-year-old Irish actress who plays Anne, filmed a scene that cannot be found anywhere in the novel. Walley-Beckett did not use a writer’s room for “Anne,” writing all seven scripts herself, and told me with no little pride that she was “almost completely off book.” To flesh out what she hopes will be an at-least-35-hour series, she filmed new histories for Matthew and Marilla that explain how they wound up emotionally remote and unmarried; reimagined one of the novel’s many spinsters as one-half of a long Boston marriage; conjured an entire character, the Cuthberts’ young farmhand, Jerry, from a few of Montgomery’s sentences; sent Marilla to a progressive parenting group in which “feminism” is complimentarily defined; aged Anne from 11 to 13; and accentuated Anne’s abusive upbringing while taking countless other liberties with the plot.",
		"13" : "Walley-Beckett has long white-blond hair and a dancer’s comportment that give her the air of a romantic disguised in bluejeans. She looked on as, in the scene, Anne both lets loose her imagination and is brought up painfully by her past. Perched on a tabletop, Anne stares into a pewter plate as if it were a mirror, imagining herself to be a Princess Cordelia, talking to her servant Griselda about a new ball gown. “I do so appreciate your attentions, Griselda,” she says to her imaginary maid, but increasingly to herself. “I think it’s important to give credit where credit is due. How awful it would be to be in service to people who neglect you and treat you unkindly. I imagine it would make you feel quite small and hopeless and occasionally despairing and sometimes lacking in confidence. I wonder if those feelings ever go away.”",
		"14" : "Early in the novel, Anne laments: “You would cry, too, if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didn’t want you because you weren’t a boy. Oh, this is the most tragical thing that ever happened to me!” Her hysteria is so charming that it masks the bleakness of her circumstance, but the circumstances are bleak indeed. Orphaned at 3 months, Anne spends years of her life working — first for the Thomases, looking after their four young children and avoiding the drunken Mr. Thomas, and then for the Hammonds, who have eight children, including three sets of twins. When Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent back to an orphanage. Anne develops her much-heralded imagination visualizing a playmate in a bookcase’s only surviving plate-glass front, so lonely she can find a friend only in her own dim reflection.",
		"15" : "All these details appear in the book, but Montgomery treats them with such a light touch that they often come to adult rereaders as a surprise, an unexpectedly painful subtext they may not have noticed as children. Walley-Beckett makes it manifest. In “Anne With an E,” Anne is constantly remembering her abuse, filmed in jerky, tightly framed, intentionally disorienting flashbacks of, for example, Mr. Hammond’s dying of a heart attack while beating her with his belt. Crying babies cause her to recall Mrs. Hammond sneeringly describe her as a “miserable piece of trash.”",
		"16" : "When she realizes that the Cuthberts do not intend to keep her, instead of exclaiming, “Tragical!” as she does in the book, Anne falls to her knees and enters a momentary fugue state. Anne’s imagination and bottomless energy are clearly presented in the TV series as coping mechanisms, a frantic and resourceful means of keeping upsetting memories at bay. “I like imagining better than remembering,” Anne says, always choosing between one and the other.",
		"17" : "It is Walley-Beckett’s interest in trauma that attracted her to both “Breaking Bad” and “Anne of Green Gables.” “I am drawn to the psychology of wounded people,” she says, linking Walter White to Anne Shirley like a vulture to a moth: It’s true, they both fly. (To get a further sense of Walley-Beckett’s typical interests: She worked on “Anne With an E” while on location for “The Grizzlies,” a movie she wrote about teenage suicide in Nunavut territory in the Canadian Arctic.) “I was extremely drawn to what it meant to be an orphan in that time,” Walley-Beckett says, “what it meant to not belong, what it meant to be derided and abused and maintain the forthright, determined optimism and point of view that Anne has.” If, in “Anne of Green Gables,” hints of Anne’s suffering occasionally waft by, like feathers that escaped from a down pillow, in “Anne” the feathers hang as heavy as if there had just been a pillow fight.",
		"18" : "Viewers familiar with the books and previous adaptations may feel when watching “Anne With an E” that the emphasis is on the wrong syllable, while also finding something provoking and substantive in the new pronunciation. Walley-Beckett’s series is recognizably “Anne of Green Gables,” but with a grimmer feel. Anne still, for example, smashes a slate over the head of her future husband, Gilbert Blythe, when he has the temerity to call her “Carrots,” but this is no longer foreplay; it’s the culmination of many weeks of bullying, including by an older boy who calls her a “talking dog” because she is an orphan. Even the show’s handsome look, which Walley-Beckett developed with the director Niki Caro (“Whale Rider”), is naturalistic and washed-out, evoking sepia despite being in color.",
		"19" : "Anne’s transformations are easy to see as part of a trend in TV and film, one in which suffering has become indistinguishable from gravitas and even the most cheerful superheroes come complete with psychological baggage. In a world where Superman no longer smiles, Archie Andrews is an ennui-filled singer-songwriter and Belle’s mother in “Beauty and the Beast” tragically dies of the plague, of course Anne has PTSD. But this new interpretation of Anne also treats a young, female character with the attention and focus often reserved for difficult men and the perversions of their machismo. In emphasizing Anne’s past, Walley-Beckett may be roughing up a sunny tale, but she is also insisting that a plucky 13-year-old girl is as worthy a subject as anyone. “I don’t see the point in doing ‘Anne’ in a way that’s been done, that’s very charming, teacups and doilies and ‘Oh, Anne’s in another scrape,’ ” Walley-Beckett told me. “What’s the most realistic way to show the way a girl like this, from a strange place, with enormous prejudices against her, would move through the world?”",
		"20" : "If you know only one thing about Anne Shirley, it is most likely that she has red hair. Maybe you can even picture it, braided into pigtails, sticking out from underneath an unfortunate straw hat, as when Matthew first sets eyes on her. In the 1890s, red hair was a symbol of witchiness, ugliness, passion. Anne’s hair immediately establishes her as an outsider, even as it intimates a kinship between her and Avonlea, with its startling red roads. Anne wants nothing so much as to be rid of it. “I can’t be perfectly happy,” she tells Matthew with characteristic drama on their first ride to Green Gables. “Nobody could who has red hair. ... It will be my lifelong sorrow.”",
		"21" : "Anne longs to be beautiful. Not only does she wish for her hair to turn a more dignified auburn, she also tells her best friend, Diana Barry, “I’d rather be pretty than clever.” Praying at Marilla’s behest, she asks God to let her stay at Green Gables and to “please let me be good-looking when I grow up.” She loves pretty things, because she has had none, and swoons over cherry blossoms, an amethyst brooch and the possibility of one day having a stylish dress with puffed sleeves, which sensible Marilla refuses to make for her.",
		"22" : "If “Anne of Green Gables” were written today, it is easy to imagine that over the course of the book, Anne would come to learn that none of these externalities matter: not the color of her hair, not the sleeves of her dress. Instead, in the novel, her hair mellows to the coveted auburn, and Matthew, in a moment of tremendous fatherly kindness, gives her a dress with puffed sleeves. Rather than dispense the message that it’s only what’s on the inside that counts, “Anne of Green Gables” conveys something more nuanced, that beauty can be a pleasure, that costumes can provide succor, that the right dress can improve your life — all things that adults know to be true, sometimes, but that we try to simplify for our children.",
		"23" : "“Green Gables” is rife with complications like these; it’s an artifact from a different time that, instead of being outdated, speaks to ours in an uncanned, unpredictable voice. Anne has survived for so long because she is more sophisticated than she initially seems.",
		"24" : "The book, in a manner that is rare for young-adult novels even now, is a celebration of Anne’s intelligence, which is ultimately cherished by her adoptive parents, her community and her future partner, Gilbert — who is also her closest academic rival and who instead of being threatened by Anne’s brain admires her for it. And yet at the end of “Anne of Green Gables,” Anne quits college and returns to the farm to care for an ailing Marilla, never becoming the writer she wanted to be as a child. This is, perhaps, a disappointing ending (and one that presages a string of follow-up novels in which Anne eventually becomes muted by family life), but it is an honest one: We still live in a world where a woman’s intellect does not preclude her from accruing vast domestic responsibilities.",
		"25" : "“Anne of Green Gables” is also a romance, but a slow-burning one. Anne can’t stand Gilbert until the final pages of the first novel, her attentions turned less to love than her friendship with Diana. In the middle of the third novel in the series, “Anne of the Island,” Anne is still putting Gilbert off, rejecting his proposal of marriage. It is not until the beginning of the fifth book, “Anne’s House of Dreams,” by which point Anne has had other suitors and other proposals, that the two are finally married, going on to have seven children. For all her curiosity, imagination and education, Anne eventually arrives at the traditional ending: a husband, a family and all the attendant duties, the nonconforming woman who conforms. But the novels do not present this as either a great tragedy or a great victory. Instead, these choices look a lot like the fraught and difficult compromises of adulthood, in which you might put aside personal desires to care for your mother or modify your career goals to accommodate children. We would flatter ourselves to think that there is anything particularly old-fashioned about Anne’s trajectory. She is a thoroughly modern girl.",
		"26" : "A few hours after shooting the scene with Princess Cordelia, Walley-Beckett was sitting in her sparsely furnished office, saying hello to her dog, Tiger, a rescue she found on the set of “Breaking Bad.” Her show’s costume designer, Anne Dixon, walked in to show her a swatch of muted jacquard covered in embroidered flowers — very couchlike. It was a candidate for the material that would be used for Anne’s dream dress, the aforementioned surprise gift from Matthew. Walley-Beckett wanted “something more best,” perhaps in Anne’s favorite colors, “willow green and azure blue,” which she knew off the top of her head. “But satin would be too much?” Dixon inquired, before referring to the analogous dress in the 1985 CBC mini-series. “When Megan Follows comes out, it’s so ... big.”",
		"27" : "“Eighties polyester?” Walley-Beckett countered, as if polyester were a bad taste in her mouth.",
		"28" : "This may sound innocuous enough, but to a certain subset of “Green Gables” fans, those are fighting words. Walley-Beckett’s series is contending with memories not only of the novel, but also of the 1985 mini-series, which is so beloved among a certain group of “Green Gables” admirers — probably women, of impressionable age in the ’80s, perhaps from Canada, where it was one of the highest-rated programs that had ever aired — that it has surpassed the books as the canonical text. (“Can ‘Anne of Green Gables’ overcome 30 years of nostalgia?” an article published in The Guardian recently wondered, as if the 1985 series, not the book, were the original.) The mini-series ensorcelled a generation of “Green Gables” lovers with its own interpretation of Montgomery’s novel, one that was faithful to the tone of the book but emphasized the romance between Anne and Gilbert. If you think of “Anne of Green Gables” as a love story and swoon at the name Gilbert Blythe, chances are you watched the mini-series. The director, Kevin Sullivan, accentuated the blooming (and admittedly captivating) romance between Gilbert and Anne to the extent that the scholar Susan Drain argued that the novel’s “careful character-building had been sacrificed to the television love story” in a 1987 academic article titled “Too Much Lovemaking: ‘Anne of Green Gables’ on Television.”",
		"29" : "But just as evidence of Anne and Gilbert’s love story exists in the text of the first novel, and was drawn out by Sullivan, so does the trauma that Walley-Beckett stresses. The last book Montgomery wrote in the Anne series, “The Blythes Are Quoted,” is a structurally experimental and grim volume of poetry and short stories, concerning the death of one of Anne’s children, World War I, adultery and murder. It is so wholly a departure from what came before that it was not published in its entirety until 2009, despite purportedly having arrived on Montgomery’s publisher’s doorstep the day she died in 1942.",
		"30" : "A bleaker interpretation of “Green Gables” is further supported by the life of L.M. Montgomery herself. Montgomery’s mother died when she was an infant, and her father left her to be raised by her cold grandparents in Cavendish, P.E.I., the future model for Anne’s Avonlea. A high-spirited young woman, at odds with her caregivers, she nonetheless spent years caring for her aging grandmother, eventually marrying a depressive preacher while contending with her own mood disorder. “Montgomery was a woman who wrote about expansive, sunny worlds,” says the professor Mavis Reimer, an Anne scholar who holds the Chair in Young People’s Texts and Cultures at the University of Winnipeg, “but she lived in a dark little room.” She may have committed suicide. Her official cause of death was coronary thrombosis, but a note was found by her bed that read, in part: “My position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best in spite of many mistakes.”",
		"31" : "But as Margaret Atwood wrote in an essay on the occasion of the “Anne of Green Gables” centenary, “The presiding genius of ‘Anne’ is not the gritty gray Angel of Realism, but the rainbow-​colored, dove-winged Godlet of the Heart’s Desire.” Montgomery’s life may have been hard, but her writing, purposefully, was not. In another of her novels, “Emily’s Quest,” Emily’s teacher offers his pupil a bit of advice: “Don’t be led away by those howls about realism. Remember — pine woods are just as real as pigsties and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.” It is not an accident that young readers finish “Anne of Green Gables” feeling as comforted as the odd child who has found a kindred spirit: They are meant to.",
		"32" : "You can concede that shaking things up is the creatively fulfilling spirit in which to undertake an adaptation (Say something new!) while also recognizing that adaptations of beloved stories, particularly those worshiped by those sticklers for repetition known as children, will always be subject to reactionary desires (Say something familiar!). We want dear tales to be as we recall them, even as we rely on memories formed when we understood less but could wonder more. It doesn’t matter how accomplished, how polished, how heady and period-perfect “Anne With an E” may be: We want Anne to be as we remember her — even if we don’t remember her that well.",
		"33" : "For all the changes that Walley-Beckett has made in adapting “Anne of Green Gables,” she understands this sentiment. “I take nothing away from Anne,” Walley-Beckett insists. “She is buoyant, she’s optimistic, she’s bright, she’s fiery, she’s sunny, she’s imaginative, she’s curious. I just add in the reality of her history.”",
		"34" : "And so in addition to drawing out the darkness embedded within the text, Walley-Beckett has also included lovely and entirely concocted moments that match the sweetness of the novel, like when Matthew and Marilla ask Anne to sign her name in the Cuthbert family Bible and make herself, officially, one of them. “Shouldn’t we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever, or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?” Anne wonders, by way of asking for a grand ceremony to mark the occasion, before settling instead for a celebratory glass of raspberry cordial and a signature. “With this pen,” Anne says, her hands shaking, “I take you, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, to be my family forever, to call you mine and to be yours, for always.” Then she writes down her name."

		"1" : "The stretcher carrying the 19-year-old woman was hurried into the emergency department of Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz. Her breath moved in and out erratically. Her jaw was clenched shut, and she held her arms stiffly at her side.",
		"2" : "The night before, the girl called her mother and told her she was vomiting and had a terrible pain in her stomach. Her mother, who lived in Texas, asked if she needed to go to the emergency room. The girl thought not, so the mother offered to make a doctor’s appointment for her the next day. But when her mother called her in the morning, to let her know the time of the appointment, she got no answer. Worried, she called her older daughter, also a student at Banner, and asked her to check on the younger. The sister found her in her dorm bathroom, unconscious and covered in vomit. The water was still running in the sink, and an electric toothbrush buzzed nearby, suggesting a sudden, unexpected collapse.",
		"3" : "The young woman had no medical problems, her sister told the emergency team. But she had gone to the E.R. three months earlier — taken by friends who noticed that she seemed confused. At that visit, she had an M.R.I. of her brain and some blood tests. The tests were unremarkable except for a minor abnormality in the test of her liver function. (She saw a doctor for that a few weeks later who didn’t pursue it when her levels normalized.) She got better with time and some IV fluids and was sent home later that night. Though testing showed no alcohol or drugs in her system, some of the doctors wondered if she’d taken something — synthetic marijuana or LSD, perhaps — that wouldn’t show up.",
		"4" : "In the E.R., the comatose young woman reacted to pain, but nothing else. She remained rigid, from her jaw to her feet, which suggested a terrible brain injury. But a CT scan of her brain looked normal. The blood tests were likewise unremarkable, save for the same minor abnormality in her liver-function test. Her heart was racing, and her breathing was ragged and irregular enough that the E.R. doctors put her on a ventilator, a machine that breathed for her, to make sure she got enough oxygen. She was sent to the intensive-care unit and given broad-spectrum antibiotics and an antiviral, in case whatever she had was caused by an infection.",
		"5" : "These are perhaps the toughest cases that doctors face: A patient comes in critically ill — dying, really — with few clues as to what is going on. The I.C.U. doctors examined the young woman as soon as she arrived but had no better understanding of what was causing her coma. They asked for help from neurology, cardiology and infectious diseases. Those doctors were baffled as well. An M.R.I. revealed that the girl’s brain had swollen and was now pushing up against the unyielding limits of the skull. If the cause of the swelling was not found and reversed, she would certainly die.",
		"6" : "An EEG (electroencephalogram) suggested that the patient’s rigid posture might be a result of an ongoing seizure. The patient was started on anti-seizure medicines. Although the seizures stopped, the patient didn’t wake up. Indeed, it was clear that she was getting worse. Her eyes, initially reactive to light, became fixed and dilated. And when icy water was squirted into her ear — a stimulation that would normally cause a strong involuntary reaction — nothing happened, indicating that her brain was not working, even at the most basic level.",
		"7" : "The team stopped all potentially sedating medications to see if they were contributing to the problem. There was no improvement. And so, after a thorough work-up and thoughtful care, eight days after this young woman was brought to the hospital, she was taken off the breathing machine. Without its assistance, she breathed no more, so the team pronounced her brain-dead.",
		"8" : "Why did this happen? The family asked over and over, but the doctors who had cared for the young woman couldn’t tell them. Her brain had swollen, and that swelling killed her, but beyond these basic facts they simply didn’t have an explanation.",
		"9" : "The family, though grieving, decided to donate the young woman’s organs. Her heart, liver and kidneys found grateful recipients. Then the family took their child’s ashes home and made plans to scatter them in a beloved place.",
		"10" : "A few weeks after the young woman’s death, her father got a call from the Donor Network of Arizona. The recipient of his daughter’s liver had died, too, just days after the transplant surgery. Shocked, the transplant team immediately went to work to find out what happened. The answer was a surprise. The liver donor had been born with a genetic defect. She was missing the genes that made a chemical called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) — a vital enzyme whose job is to help the liver break down proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of muscles, and something as simple as eating meat, or stressing the body through, say, fasting or surgery, can release additional proteins into the system. When something goes wrong with the process that breaks down protein, toxic levels of ammonia can build up, which in turn attacks the nervous system and the brain.",
		"11" : "Hyperammonemia, the medical word for high levels of ammonia, is usually caused by a liver so damaged by alcohol or disease that it can’t perform even its most basic jobs — including the breakdown of proteins. Doctors routinely test ammonia levels in patients who have liver failure, often from cirrhosis or hepatitis. But patients with OTC deficiency usually don’t have a bad liver; theirs simply fails to do this one job. And because the organ is working fine in all other ways, doctors don’t suspect hyperammonemia as a cause of coma or brain swelling. If this young woman’s ammonia level had been checked, it would have been high — maybe 10 times the normal level.",
		"12" : "OTC deficiency is not the only unusual cause of elevated ammonia. There are other diseases — some inherited, like OTC deficiency; others acquired, like herpes and certain cancers — that can do it as well. Medications, including iron and anti-seizure drugs, can also cause elevated ammonia levels. A simple blood test, performed when no other cause of coma is found, may save a life. And in the case of this young woman, possibly two.",
		"13" : "The gene for OTC is on the X chromosome, and so boys, who have only one X chromosome, are more likely to have symptoms from their OTC deficiency. Because girls have two X chromosomes, if one is defective, the other can sometimes make up for it. But for reasons that are not well understood, in the right setting, maybe after a protein-rich meal or with significant stress, like an illness, the condition can manifest in girls too, prompting their ammonia levels to spike upward. That’s probably what happened to this patient when she got sick and confused three months earlier. And that is what killed her and her liver’s recipient.",
		"14" : "As the parents read up on OTC, they recognized several symptoms in their daughter. Like many with OTC deficiency, she had always had a bad stomach — feeling nauseated or vomiting for reasons they never understood. And she rarely ate meat — she’d never liked it.",
		"15" : "The rest of the family was tested for OTC deficiency, and the girl’s father found that he, too, had the defective gene. This discovery explained so much to him — why, for example, there were times when he literally felt too tired to move or even speak. That lethargy, he now believes, is a response to a high ammonia level. These days he takes a supplement that provides the chemicals his enzyme can’t produce. And he avoids the foods that can raise his ammonia.",
		"16" : "All this information came too late to help their daughter. But perhaps others will find it useful. That, at least, is her parents’ prayer."

		"4" : "Valid though these complaints may be, they are surprising to hear from Mr. Gunn, the director of “Guardians of the Galaxy,” the Marvel space adventure film about a group of misfit heroes that, with a sarcastic, self-aware sense of humor (and a cast led by Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana), became one of the biggest films of 2014, grossing more than $770 million worldwide.",
		"5" : "Now, of course, that movie has spawned its own franchise, with a sequel, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” opening Friday, May 5, that is expected to prove even more astronomically lucrative than its predecessor.",
		"6" : "So it says a lot about Mr. Gunn, 46, who came to Hollywood by way of small-town Manchester, Mo., and a career in B-movies, that he believes he can resist the worst impulses of the studio system even while he works within it.",
		"7" : "To his mind, the “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies are still fulfilling his urge to tell stories about characters with complex, interconnected needs — even if one of those characters happens to be a talking raccoon — and to maintain the innovative traditions of his moviemaking forebears, at price tags upward of $170 million.",
		"8" : "Thinking back to the moment when he was offered the first “Guardians,” Mr. Gunn said recently in a phone interview from his home in Malibu, “I saw it as an opportunity. I could truly fill a hole of what was missing.”",
		"9" : "Mr. Pratt, who was elevated from a TV sitcom star to an A-list film actor with help from the first “Guardians,” said that project allowed “James to earn Marvel’s trust, so that he could really make the movie that he’s always wanted to make.",
		"10" : "“They provide the capital for this kind of a movie, and he does everything else.”",
		"11" : "Mr. Gunn, a former disciple of Lloyd Kaufman, the schlock-movie impresario and Troma Entertainment co-founder, wrote that company’s outrageous Shakespeare sendup “Tromeo and Juliet” with Mr. Kaufman, then graduated to studio projects like “Dawn of the Dead” and the live-action “Scooby-Doo” movies.",
		"12" : "After writing and directing the sci-fi horror pastiche “Slither” in 2006 and the violent superhero comedy “Super” in 2010, Mr. Gunn said he knew he was on Marvel’s list of directors for “Guardians,” though not high on it.",
		"13" : "Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, said that Mr. Gunn “was a name amongst many,” but added that “the secret of our list is, they’re not listed in order of preference.”",
		"14" : "“It really is based on the vibe of the meetings and discussions we have,” Mr. Feige said, “that we come to our decision of who we want to collaborate and live with for many years to come.”",
		"15" : "Given that “Guardians of the Galaxy” was based on a Marvel comic that was not especially popular at the time, filled with low-level characters who you wouldn’t even ask to cater an Avengers staff party, perhaps Mr. Gunn was ideally suited for the material.",
		"16" : "After one preliminary meeting with Marvel producers, Mr. Gunn could not quite get over the character of Rocket Raccoon, a bad-tempered, gun-toting anthropomorphic animal with the voice of Bradley Cooper.",
		"17" : "“I was like, ‘O.K., a talking raccoon – that’s a stupid idea,’” Mr. Gunn recalled. “But let’s say there was a talking raccoon. How would he exist?”",
		"18" : "Once he connected to the “extraordinary sadness” of the character’s Frankenstein-like origins, Mr. Gunn said, “it drove the whole thing for me, and I found it tonally interesting because of that.”",
		"19" : "To him, the first “Guardians” presented a chance to reinvigorate the drab, dreary space-opera genre with the buoyancy of favorite films like “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and the gaudy colors of “Flash Gordon.”",
		"20" : "The assignment came with many conditions, including a cast of characters who had to be established within the first 20 minutes, like Peter Quill (Mr. Pratt), a would-be outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord; and Gamora (Ms. Saldana), a green-skinned alien assassin. There was an existing script by Nicole Perlman and a preset release date, leaving Mr. Gunn little time to make changes. (He and Ms. Perlman shared screenplay credit on the film.)",
		"21" : "Mr. Feige said he knew he’d made the right choice when he saw what was on the cover of Mr. Gunn’s revised script treatment: A color photo of a vintage Walkman, a personal artifact treasured by Peter Quill, who uses it to play his favorite classic-rock songs.",
		"22" : "“Before I even turned the page,” Mr. Feige said, “I thought, ‘This is perfect.’”",
		"23" : "Ms. Saldana describes herself as “a sucker for sci-fi” (she also plays Uhura in the current “Star Trek” franchise), but said she often finds such screenplays challenging to read. “First of all, I think in Spanish,” she explained, “and I’m dyslexic.”",
		"24" : "But in early conversations with Mr. Gunn, she said, “I felt in his tone, his confidence, that he knew exactly what he was going to do.”",
		"25" : "Mr. Gunn, she said, represented “what is great about being a geek,” adding, “It just means that you’re curious, you’re confident, and once you make a discovery, you show it off with pride.”",
		"26" : "Mr. Gunn found making movies on a megabudget Marvel scale invigorating — “On my last movie, I did 54 setups a day with one camera, so this is easy,” he said — but also intimidating.",
		"27" : "“I would wake up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. thinking I might be making ‘Pluto Nash 2,’” he said, referring to Eddie Murphy’s costly outer-space flop from 2002. “There were moments where I was consoling myself with the thought that I could go teach.”",
		"28" : "That said, the success of the movie — which was a hit not only with audiences but with critics, and enjoys a 91 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes — bought a lot of leeway for Mr. Gunn, who started writing a second “Guardians” film as soon as the first one was released.",
		"29" : "“I got to start from scratch with the story,” he said. “The emotional and action plots were completely intertwined, and all organic and one thing.”",
		"30" : "Asked if Marvel dictated any plot elements this time, Mr. Gunn said: “None. Zero.” (Mr. Feige said, “The notion that we require things or crowbar things into one movie so it serves another” was “overblown.”)",
		"31" : "“The only restrictions this time are things that we set up in the last movie,” he added. “Other than that, it can go anywhere we want it to.”",
		"32" : "Mr. Pratt said that when they met to talk about “Vol. 2,” soon after the first “Guardians” opened, Mr. Gunn was deeply concerned about repeating himself.",
		"33" : "On the original film, Mr. Pratt said, “we benefited from people’s lowered expectations. We could sneak in and be this movie that they didn’t see coming. Now they’re waiting in line for this.",
		"34" : "“So how do you surprise somebody who’s lying in wait? He did that by just throwing away the formula of the first movie.”",
		"35" : "For “Vol. 2,” Mr. Gunn immersed himself in sources as disparate as the artwork of Jim Steranko, a comic-book illustrator known for his surrealism, psychedelia and sensuality; and the visually sumptuous movies of Wong Kar-wai.",
		"36" : "He came away inspired to add characters like Ego, a living planet who is revealed to be Quill’s father and who, in his humanoid form, is played by Kurt Russell.",
		"37" : "What connects Ego to the established “Guardians” ensemble, Mr. Gunn said, are themes of isolation and yearning to belong. “At the center of this was a lonely being who had been floating out there for eons,” he said, “dreaming if other life exists out there somewhere.”",
		"38" : "Mr. Gunn’s name also appeared earlier this year on “The Belko Experiment,” a gruesome thriller about an office complex in Colombia whose employees are forced to murder each other.",
		"39" : "Mr. Gunn wrote the screenplay and had been preparing to direct it many years ago, but withdrew when he and the actress Jenna Fischer were divorcing in 2008.",
		"40" : "“Suddenly, I was like, ‘You know what? I don’t want to make a movie about people who are killing each other,’” Mr. Gunn recalled.",
		"41" : "When MGM and Orion Pictures revived “The Belko Experiment,” Mr. Gunn stayed on as a producer. “For me it was mostly an excuse to take time off and hang with all my actor friends who I put in the movie,” he said.",
		"42" : "He explained, “There’s a bit of an edgy, violence thing in me, that maybe I need to scratch, whether that’s healthy or not.”",
		"43" : "But since he started working on the “Guardians” movies, Mr. Gunn said, “I feel like I’ve changed a lot in what stories I want to tell, through this process.",
		"44" : "“It’s very easy for me to go to the cheap shock. In some ways, it’s an emotional cover-up, as opposed to feeling sadness or dealing with the more vulnerable side of my nature.”",
		"45" : "Mr. Gunn has already announced he plans to write and direct a third “Guardians of the Galaxy” film, and said that working on any other established franchise would probably feel too constrictive.",
		"46" : "When Marvel first sought him out, he said, “I kind of did want to make a ‘Hulk’ movie, but at this point, that isn’t what I would want to do. Working in that ‘Avengers’ thing, you have to work within a pre-existing system. It’s more exciting to me to create something new.”",
		"47" : "He added: “I have a story of a raccoon I need to tell right now. Nothing else really appeals to me. I love the raccoon as much as I love my family members.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The summer blockbuster movie season kicks off when “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” hits multiplexes across America on Friday, May 5 — and it’s a good time to take a look at the rest of the year’s slate of big-screen superhero adventures.",
		"2" : "At this point, audiences have become familiar with the bright costumes, the computer-generated effects and the in-jokes for comic fans. And, in an added challenge for trailers, the summer films “Wonder Woman” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming” don’t represent their title characters’ debuts on the silver screen — a trait shared by “Justice League,” which is slated for November.",
		"3" : "Here’s how these three movies are trying to attract viewers to slightly familiar characters without feeling too formulaic.",
		"4" : "Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, popped up last year in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” where she helped that film’s heroes save the day and arguably stole the show from them. But the Amazon warrior received comparatively little screen time, and while her back story was alluded to, it was never fully realized.",
		"5" : "The new movie, due in June and directed by Patty Jenkins, looks like it will fill in the gaps. The first official trailer opened with a shot of Diana Prince, Wonder Woman’s alter ego, looking at an old black-and-white photograph and reflecting on her past. The most recent preview, released in March, ditches the framing device and dives into her history even further, explicitly positioning the film as a conventional superhero origin story.",
		"6" : "The signal starts immediately, presenting a young Diana with a challenge she has to conquer. It’s a classic biopic technique to make the chronological scope clear. Diana’s mother tells her she’s not fierce enough to wield a sword from the gods. Over the next two minutes, she proves otherwise.",
		"7" : "Challenge after challenge unfolds, and Diana rises to meet them, discovering her inner superhero one battle at a time. Piece by piece, the trailer rolls out the classic Wonder Woman symbols: First the indestructible bracelets, then the sword and the shield and, of course, the lasso of truth. By the end of the trailer, Diana strides into battle in full red-and-blue regalia, and her journey is complete.",
		"8" : "Still, the trailer makes sure to highlight what sets the movie apart from comic-book cinema: its gender dynamics. It has been more than a decade since a female-led superhero movie hit the big screen (remember “Elektra”?), and while women like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have had important roles in big franchises, Diana stands alone. The trailer wisely highlights that, showing her sparring mostly with female partners and making the one male character, the military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), into an outsider.",
		"9" : "In a crucial moment, Steve steps in front of Diana to protect her from a gunfight. But with the flick of a wrist, she is the one who saves him. The scene makes it instantly clear that Diana is not the typical damsel in distress of past comic-book adaptations. Steve looks suitably impressed; audiences probably will be, too.",
		"10" : "Let’s get it out of the way: Peter Parker was bitten by a spider that gave him superpowers. We know this because we’ve seen it twice onscreen in the last 15 years: in “Spider-Man” (2002) and again 10 years later in “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Now comes Tom Holland in the “spider suit” in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” due in July. As with “Wonder Woman,” the new film isn’t this particular Spider-Man’s debut; he popped up last year in “Captain America: Civil War.”",
		"11" : "That may be why the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” which arrived in March, doesn’t waste time on introductions. In 15 seconds, it establishes that Peter Parker has a high-tech suit and some powers, and that he knows how to use them. Then it skips to establishing a major setback in his heroic journey instead of explaining how he became a web-slinging crime fighter.",
		"12" : "As a result, the preview feels as if it’s heralding a Spider-Man sequel rather than the first installment of a reboot. When Peter’s in the back of a car with Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), we don’t get any details of their shared history. (Tony is the one who gave Peter the suit.) The trailer doesn’t give much insight into the film’s villain or elaborate on its occasional references to Avengers movies past.",
		"13" : "Instead, it sets up a mentor-mentee dynamic for Peter and Tony, one that frays as Peter finds himself in a situation that he can’t handle. Suddenly, the confidence he shows in the trailer’s well-chosen first sequence is destroyed. That, in turn, is what raises the stakes and suspense in the subsequent action footage, which shows Spider-Man trying to restore his former glory and return to the status quo the trailer established so quickly. Unlike with Wonder Woman, whose future has already been glimpsed onscreen, it’s not quite as clear whether Peter Parker will succeed.",
		"14" : "If introducing or reintroducing a hero who is suddenly headlining his own movie is a challenge, the trailer for “Justice League” has to highlight five of them. The film is both a sequel to “Batman v Superman” and the origin story of the crime-fighting team that lends the new movie its title. Its muddled preview tries to split the difference.",
		"15" : "Like the trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the preview for “Justice League” jumps into the familiar, using as a framing device a conversation between Wonder Woman and Batman (that’s Ben Affleck this time, not Christian Bale). They allude to a vague threat, giving the trailer its only real sense of intrigue, before getting right to the point: the other heroes who are joining their superhuman team.",
		"16" : "One by one, shots of Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and the Flash (Ezra Miller) pop up, accompanied by snippets of bios in voice-overs. These three had cameos in “Batman v Superman,” but audiences were told even less about them than they learned about Wonder Woman. In this case, the trailer for “Justice League” offers glimpses that are a preamble to a group shot of the new team.",
		"17" : "There’s not much more on display here; what follows are big, sweeping action sequences that take the audience’s familiarity with these characters as a given. All five heroes get to shine in fight scenes as a cover of the Beatles’ “Come Together” blares. But the characters hardly do; shot after shot shows them fighting in isolation, exhibiting their powers and helping what appears to be the movie’s sixth star: C.G.I."

		"1" : "On a recent afternoon, in a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, three dozen people assembled behind a strip of tape fixed like a starting line to the concrete floor. Some had burlap sacks tied around their waists to free up their arms; others wore gloves.",
		"2" : "A manager placed his hands on his hips, and with all the energy of an exhausted school principal, he addressed the line: “No running, no pushing, no fighting, understand?” He shot pointed looks at a few people. “No throwing clothes on the floor.” He repeated the message in Spanish, and stood aside.",
		"3" : "The group race-walked past him, toward a few dozen bins covered by sheets and blankets, and as they threw off the covers and descended on the clothes inside, their cries echoed through the space.",
		"4" : "“This one’s got nothing.”",
		"5" : "“Ay, Dios mío!”",
		"6" : "This is a regular routine — it takes place several times a day, when a new batch of merchandise is wheeled out — at the Goodwill Outlet, a warehouse with a 9,000-square-foot sales floor where items donated to Goodwill end up if they fail to sell at New York City’s 14 Goodwill stores.",
		"7" : "The clothing here is cheaper than at the stores and sold in bulk — $1.69 per pound for the first 20 pounds, with prices dropping from there. Much of it is also of high quality, reflecting the city’s prosperity and its fickleness. And since the Goodwill Outlet opened, in 2009, it has become a destination for fashion bloggers, buyers from vintage stores, thrifty families — and, outnumbering every other group, dozens of immigrants who buy and resell the clothes in their communities, and in their home countries.",
		"8" : "“Converse, Banana, Express,” said Araceli Infante, a 40-year-old mother of two, listing the brand names she often finds. “Nice clothes, dresses, sometimes with tags.”",
		"9" : "Ms. Infante, like many regular shoppers at the outlet, comes from the Dominican Republic. For decades, Dominican immigrants have supplied sellers in their native country with pre-owned clothing bought in the United States, which is then sold from people’s homes, or from stalls outside their homes.",
		"10" : "She said she had helped support her family for the past three years by shipping boxes of clothes purchased at the Goodwill Outlet to people in Santo Domingo. She sold boxes containing 200 articles of clothing for about $450 each. The name-brand items were then sold piece by piece. “Everything sells” as long as it is unused, she said in Spanish, adding, “From a panty to a sock.”",
		"11" : "In 2016, according to Goodwill Industries, the New York and New Jersey operation diverted 128 million pounds of items from landfills, up from 117 million pounds the year before.",
		"12" : "Merchandise arrives at the outlet from the Goodwill stores via truck three or four times a day. Its shelf-life is brief. In the stores, items, which go for about $5 to $40, have a week or two to find a home. In the outlet, they have a day. What does not sell in one day at the outlet is baled and sold by the ton to textile recyclers. (Nonclothing items are sold to salvage.)",
		"13" : "Some shoppers come a long way to buy clothes. Kenia Almanzar, 63, said she traveled to the United States from the Dominican Republic once a month to shop at the outlet and at similar ones in New Jersey and Connecticut. Ms. Almanzar said that she used to sell new clothes, but that after struggling with taxes imposed on small businesses she closed her shop and began reselling Americans’ discarded clothing.",
		"14" : "Next to the outlet is an Indoor Extreme Sports center, where people play paintball and zombie laser tag. What happens at the outlet can sometimes resemble an indoor extreme sport. “When the covers come off, let’s just say it’s every man for themselves,” said Jonathan Love, 29, who came to the outlet looking for vintage clothes he would sell on Instagram. “People go in and they dig and they just throw. I’ve had a shoe fly past my head. I’ve learned to just stand back and let the crazy happen.”",
		"15" : "Higinio Flores, 80, the father of one of the Dominican women, sat waiting while his daughter shopped. “They get into it,” he said. “They fight, but they don’t get physical.”",
		"16" : "The fights, according to regulars, arise from dueling factions.",
		"17" : "“There’s a group that dominates us,” Ms. Infante said. She pointed out a cluster of Dominican women whom she identified as the old-timers at the outlet. She said that last year, after the management let customers use sacks and plastic bags instead of just draping the clothes over their arms, the women started hoarding. They would grab clothes by the armful and would later gather in a corner to cherry-pick the best items.",
		"18" : "“Sometimes they’re very pushy,” Ms. Infante said. “They come ready to fight. The weaker of us can’t get in and get anything.” She added, “I used to get 50 or 60 pounds, now I’m getting 20 or 15.” she said.",
		"19" : "Women in the faction she pointed out declined to be interviewed.",
		"20" : "Asked about fighting, the manager, Sal Ciniglio, shook his head, a smile playing on his lips, and said, “No comment.” He added, “We run a safe store.”",
		"21" : "In response to the competition, Ms. Infante said, “we joined forces.” She gestured to a woman folding a jade-colored Moschino top. The two Dominican women, who had met at the outlet, often left together, wheeling their bulging suitcases to the subway.",
		"22" : "Immigrants from several other countries frequent the warehouse, too. Claudia Romero, from Puebla, Mexico, held up a brand-new workout tank-top that said, “I Love Sweat,” and gave a thumbs-up. Two middle-aged women from Morocco wearing head scarves looked with curiosity at a pair of red suede platforms with a five-inch heel.",
		"23" : "One woman, from Ecuador, declined to be interviewed at the Goodwill outlet but spoke later by telephone. She said a small number of Ecuadorean and Mexican immigrants were among the regulars, but the Dominicans were the unofficial rulers of the outlet.",
		"24" : "The woman said she sold clothes to friends, but her main customers were the Dominican women themselves, to whom she sold items for a small profit.",
		"25" : "Despite the cliques, the regulars called each other by name and went to the management to resolve disputes. On a typical day, the biggest complaints were someone plucking an item from someone else’s cart or finding a beautiful shoe forever parted from its mate.",
		"26" : "But there were moments of drama. Recently, one of the Dominican women’s purses disappeared, distracted as she was, looking through the bins. Inside it were her Social Security card and residency documents. She stood between bins crying.",
		"27" : "Another afternoon, a young man arrived at the outlet hoping to find two containers of his ex-girlfriend’s things. He said he had reacted badly when he found out she was involved with somebody new. So he said he went around his apartment looking for things that reminded him of his old love. People do rash things in crisis. He donated them to Goodwill.",
		"28" : "When he told her, offhandedly, she was furious. He rushed back to his local Goodwill store. An employee said that the containers had either been sold or taken to the outlet. When he arrived at the gigantic warehouse in Queens, his heart sank. There were several bins for pillows alone.",
		"29" : "Mr. Ciniglio checked in back, and came back with a scowl on his face. “It’s hard,” he said, trying to find a comforting word.",
		"30" : "After the last batch of the day was wheeled out, once the initial frenzy died down, the customers settled into searching through the remainders — pulling a sweater from a heap, throwing it back, untangling slacks.",
		"31" : "A song came over the speakers, and quietly, then more loudly, many of the shoppers began singing — the immigrant women, the vintage store owners, three recent college grads in all-thrift outfits.",
		"32" : "“Never mind, I’ll find someone like you,” they sang, speaking the universal language of Adele.",
		"33" : "“I wish nothing but the best for you too.”"

		"1" : "On a recent overcast afternoon, the line to enter Made Nice, a new 31-seat fast-casual restaurant, snaked onto the sidewalk and down West 28th Street. After all, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, of the lauded restaurants Eleven Madison Park and  NoMad, were attached. Inside the space, with its high ceilings, a Shepard Fairey mural and an open kitchen, some customers excitedly pored over paper menus and trawled for tables, while those lucky enough to be seated were tucking into their quinoa tabbouleh with falafel and pickled beets or khao salad with steak, crispy rice and roasted broccoli. The upbeat background music — a mix of hip-hop, ’90s hits and current tunes — added to the festive vibe. SHIVANI VORA",
		"2" : "IN THE SEATS Ehtesham Malik, 27, who lives in Harlem; Yuchen Lu, 24, and Chunli Liang, 25, who live in Jersey City; and Julia Park, 20, who lives on the West Side. All are actuary interns for a major insurance company.",
		"3" : "ON THE PLATES  Mr. Malik chose the salmon rösti, which is a frisée salad with smoked salmon, a soft-boiled egg, dill-caper relish, potato croutons, cucumbers, radishes and pickled onions dressed in a buttermilk vinaigrette ($15). To drink, he ordered the Dr. Greens, a house-made soda with apples, mint and celery ($3.50). Ms. Park and Ms. Liang both ate the chicken rice, a combination of braised chicken thighs, basmati rice, Parmesan, tomatoes, scallions, rosemary and lemon ($14). Ms. Lu went with the curried cauliflower, which also had tofu, couscous, coconut, lemongrass, almonds and grapes ($11). For dessert, she ordered the milk and honey soft-serve ice cream with honey brittle, oat shortbread and buckwheat honey ($6).",
		"4" : "WHY THEY CAME The meal had become a tradition. The foursome instantly bonded when they met in January at the start of their internships, and they have had lunch together once a week ever since. But this occasion was special because Ms. Park, Ms. Liang and Ms. Lu were finishing their internships (Mr. Malik will continue through the summer), and they were unsure when they would have the chance to dine together again. “This is sort of our goodbye lunch,” Ms. Lu said. They went to Made Nice because she had read about the opening and thought the restaurant sounded interesting and affordable.",
		"5" : "WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Mr. Malik started off by telling the three women about a new office building he had heard about in the Flatiron neighborhood where the employees are plied with free food all day. He said the building also had a game room and a spiffy gym with classes. The four discussed their workweek and the projects they were in the middle of and wrapping up. “The hours are manageable so it’s not like we’re working all the time,” Mr. Malik said.",
		"6" : "After getting shoptalk out of the way, they discussed the jazz performance Ms. Lu and Ms. Liang had caught the night before at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola at Lincoln Center. “The show was good but not as good as other jazz shows I’ve seen,” Ms. Lu said. Ms. Liang then told the group that she had plans to see “Wicked” that evening, a Broadway show long on her wish list. “I love culture and try to see as many performances, shows and concerts as I can, which is easy to do in New York,” she said.",
		"7" : "The conversation eventually turned to their plans for the coming months. Ms. Liang and Ms. Park would be heading back to Canada, where they both go to school. Ms. Lu was also wrapping up her internship and was set to travel to California to study for the actuary exam in June. “I’ll look for a job after I take the exam,” she said.",
		"8" : "Ms. Malik’s internship will run through mid-August, and he, too, plans to study for the actuary exam and hunt for a job. “We’re all focused on our futures,” he said."

		"1" : "Q. Why are there so many cemeteries near the border of Brooklyn and Queens? And what happens when they’re all filled up?",
		"2" : "A. There are more than a dozen cemeteries near the line separating the two boroughs, in an area sometimes called the Cemetery Belt. More than five million people are buried in Queens alone, outnumbering those living there by more than two to one.",
		"3" : "The reason for the concentration is simple: As the population of New York — then just the island of Manhattan — soared in the early 19th century, the city had trouble finding space for its dead. Churchyards and backyard family plots, long the burial locations of choice, were hemmed in by buildings and could not expand; instead, bodies were sometimes piled into shallow mass graves.",
		"4" : "As a result, by 1822, unbearable odors were emanating from some cemeteries. To try to speed decomposition, one official had the yard at Trinity Church slaked with lime; he later wrote to a colleague, “The stench was so offensive as to cause several of my laborers to cascade freely.” (Yes, “cascade” means exactly what you think it does.) Burials were banned south of Canal Street the next year.",
		"5" : "The state government addressed the issue in 1847, when it passed the Rural Cemetery Act. Inspired by the example of cemeteries like Père Lachaise in Paris, Mount Auburn outside of Boston and Green-Wood in Brooklyn, the law allowed religious institutions and other entities to buy tax-exempt property for grave sites in undeveloped areas.",
		"6" : "In stark contrast to the slums of Lower Manhattan, which were crowded with tenements, the area around the border between Kings and Queens Counties was barren and, thus, an ideal location for numerous human remains.",
		"7" : "“It’s land that is bumpy and rocky and difficult to farm on,” said Jack Eichenbaum, the Queens borough historian. “The cemeteries developed a part of Queens that was not developable for anything else.”",
		"8" : "A land rush followed the act’s passage, as religious institutions and other organizations, not to mention enterprising speculators, raced to buy pastoral property.",
		"9" : "“The ideal location had rolling topography, views of the harbor and very short vistas,” said Jeff Richman, the historian of Green-Wood Cemetery. “This was land that was not really good for farming or for constructing a pond but perfect for a picturesque cemetery.”",
		"10" : "Cemeteries were popular leisure destinations; during the 1860s, Green-Wood rivaled Niagara Falls as the nation’s top tourist site.",
		"11" : "In Manhattan, burials were banned south of 86th Street in 1852, because of the supposed role of human corpses in spreading outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever.",
		"12" : "Over the next few decades, rising property values led most of Manhattan’s graveyards to evict their residents. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were exhumed and taken by cart and boat to new final resting places, sometimes in the dead of night, to limit the number of onlookers. Because of mass burials and disintegrated coffins, many of the remains had scattered.",
		"13" : "Today, even the other boroughs are running out of burial spots. Calvary Cemetery in Queens, where three million Catholics are buried, and Washington Cemetery, a Jewish graveyard in Brooklyn, are among sites that have been completely developed. Both have taken pains in recent years to find additional space for ground burials.",
		"14" : "There are no current plans for the establishment of new cemeteries in New York City, according to the New York State Department of State. Any new cemeteries would require the City Council’s approval."

		"1" : "Dr. John Zhang, a well-known specialist in reproductive medicine who runs the New Hope Fertility Center out of a vast and science-fiction-looking office on Columbus Circle, believes he has played a singular role in the fiscal health of New York City. Patients come to him from around the world, from the Middle East, from Kenya, from Nigeria, Spain and China. Perhaps especially from China.",
		"2" : "Dr. Zhang is a native of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang Province, “a city that produces smart people,” he explained on a recent afternoon from behind a desk with a view of Central Park and the Time Warner Center, where he lives. Jack Ma, the business magnate and founder of the Alibaba Group, is also from Hangzhou. “People say, ‘Who are the two most famous people from Hangzhou?’ They say, ‘Dr. Zhang and Jack Ma!’” Dr. Zhang’s speaking style rarely omits enthusiastic punctuation.",
		"3" : "Infertility treatments can take a long time and often require daily blood tests, so his patients stay in hotels — expensive ones, like the Mandarin Oriental around the block — and go to restaurants, he pointed out. In many cases, they bring along their mothers and friends, generally supplementing the city’s tax base with a kind of endocrinological tourism. Come for the Clomid, stay for Per Se.",
		"4" : "Some of Dr. Zhang’s patients, envisioning further babies and more in vitro fertilization procedures and births in New York, wind up buying pieds-à-terre on West 57th Street, he told me. “It goes both ways,” he remarked, meaning that he often receives patient referrals from real estate agents.",
		"5" : "Not long ago, Dr. Zhang was contacted by a local television news channel to talk about National Infertility Awareness Week. He realized that he didn’t know anything about the campaign, and neither, he believed, did many of his colleagues. What possible significance could it have if some of the top practitioners in the field were doing nothing substantial in regard to it? Dr. Zhang decided he wanted to make the effort mean something, that it should be, as he put it, like Restaurant Week, when New York diners are offered reduced prices, in part to attract those who might not otherwise be able to afford the experience.",
		"6" : "As impetuously as one might choose to have chicken shawarma for lunch rather than a patty melt, Dr. Zhang decided he would hold a lottery to give away 30 in vitro fertilization cycles at no cost, amounting to roughly $1 million worth of treatment. Women age 43 and under would be eligible, and although drugs, which can be thousands of dollars a cycle, would not be included in the windfall, it was possible, after all, that a pharmaceutical company, in all of its largess, might want to participate with an offer of free medication. Couples would merely have to submit some basic information to New Hope via  email by May 1.",
		"7" : "One applicant quickly wrote in that she would love to win Dr. Zhang’s lottery because she and her husband had been trying to conceive for eight years, and were now “desperate.” Lotteries prey on the desperate, of course, and for this reason a similar scheme proposed in Britain several years ago was greeted with a certain horror by ethicists. More recently, some fertility clinics in the United States have employed another sort of gambling model, asking couples to pay more than usual for treatment up front, with the promise that if they did not bear a child, their money would be returned.",
		"8" : "In the case of Dr. Zhang’s lottery, winners must agree to forfeit their anonymity, because their good fortune is to be announced next week via Facebook Live, as if they had won a chance for free makeovers at Sephora.",
		"9" : "What of the couples already haunted by infertility, the men and women who might have depleted their finances after two or three failed cycles of treatment, whose hearts are now soaring with new hope? What happens when they lose? Dr. Zhang’s position remains that his gambit will ultimately lead to more discussion of infertility generally and reveal how vast the community of couples struggling with the issue really is. In a sense, what he is doing merely caricatures the Las Vegas-style medical culture we already live with, especially in New York, where often the best doctors don’t take insurance — they need not bother — making themselves, in effect, available only to the well-off.",
		"10" : "Advances in infertility treatment, specifically the procedure pioneered by Dr. Zhang using nuclear transfer, known as egg rejuvenation, would only further favor the wealthy if it ever came into use. In this situation, the DNA of an older mother would infuse the healthy casing of a donor egg, from which the young donor’s own DNA had been removed — “The Handmaid’s Tale” in a new, if more benign, version."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "One Friday night at a bar in San Francisco, I took a look at the menu and found myself face to face once again with the curious modern-day ubiquity of the Asian salad. The “Asian Emperor Salad,” with its “31 ingredients representing the tastes, textures and flavors of Asia,” stirred something other than hunger in me.",
		"2" : "I tried to identify exactly what that was. I made a halfhearted joke to my husband about just which Asian emperor this salad was honoring. I thought about its grand imprecision, which irritated me as a Chinese-American. And I wondered, who cooked up this thing?",
		"3" : "I was reasonably sure it wasn’t anyone Asian, but I did some investigating to find out.",
		"4" : "In many American restaurants, the Asian salad is right up there next to the Greek salad and the Caesar salad. You might think this is progress — cultural inclusion on a menu. And yet the Asian salad is often the one that comes with a winky, jokey name: Oriental Chop Chop. Mr. Mao’s. Secret Asian Man. Asian Emperor. China Island. Chicken Asian Chop Chop. Chinese-y Chicken.",
		"5" : "In the weird cultural geography of the casual-restaurant menu, half-century-old jokes about Asians and long-discarded terminology jostle up against chicken tenders and nacho plates.",
		"6" : "The persistence of these names — let’s at least call them “questionable” — on the American restaurant menu underscores how non-Asian-Americans have been making up their own version of Asianness for a long time now. While the Greek salad has some integrity — by this I mean that in Greece you will actually find a salad that looks like this — and the Caesar is a creation attributed to the 1920s-era restaurateur Caesar Cardini, the Asian salad stands apart as a strange kind of fiction.",
		"7" : "As early as 1906, top New York restaurants were serving something called “Oriental salad” for 80 cents a pop, but it wasn’t clear what distinguished it. As this newspaper observed that same year: “You could save on the salad. Oriental, Russian and mixed salads are nearly all the same thing.” Recipes for “Chinese chicken salad” started appearing in American newspapers in the ’30s, but their components ranged far and wide, from mayonnaise and gelatin to pineapple chunks and celery and, in one case, French dressing.",
		"8" : "At the time, it seemed that “Chinese” was merely a synonym for “new” or “different.” The tie to Chinese cuisine was already weak, since people in China did not generally eat uncooked vegetables; more common were cold chicken dishes with the vegetables blanched or stir-fried. In 1960s America, with the lifting of the cap on immigration from Asia, dressings using actual ingredients from Chinese cooking — sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger — entered the rotation. Chinese chicken salad grew popular. Pretty soon there were competing claims of origin.",
		"9" : "By the ’80s, “Asian fusion” was the name applied to what high-minded chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Roy Yamaguchi and Jean-Georges Vongerichten were doing with the marriage of traditional Asian and French ingredients. Mr. Puck’s restaurant Chinois on Main, in Santa Monica, Calif., was credited with pioneering fusion cuisine in the United States. One of his most popular dishes is the Chinois chicken salad: it features a sesame-soy-mustard vinaigrette, Napa cabbage, romaine lettuce and shredded roast chicken.",
		"10" : "Mr. Puck himself resisted reductive terms for his cooking — “It’s not as simple as adding ginger and soy sauce — and voilà, Asian fusion,” he told The Huffington Post — but that is, in fact, what happened. When the Asian salad fad exploded, something that was cooked up by non-Asians became, well, “Asian” in the popular imagination. A single Cheesecake Factory, Rainforest Cafe or Applebee’s could sell 500 Asian salads a week. Each chain punched up the name to seem foreign yet familiar.",
		"11" : "So what’s my problem with Asian salad? It’s not the salad itself, though it’s not my favorite. It’s the words — which, I think, matter. In many ways, the broad, generic terminology used to refer to an entire continent is the heart of it. Applebee’s menu features an “Oriental chicken salad” with the following description: “fresh Asian greens tossed in a tasty Oriental vinaigrette.” The “Asian greens” and “Oriental vinaigrette” are so laughably vague as to have no meaning at all. When I asked Applebee’s for more specifics on what made its Asian greens Asian and its Oriental vinaigrette Oriental, a spokesman told me the company was unable to “provide a thorough response.” No kidding.",
		"12" : "Am I taking this too seriously? The casual racism of the Asian salad stems from the idea of the exotic — who is and isn’t American is caught up wholesale in its creation. This use of “Oriental” and “Asian” is rooted in the wide-ranging, “all look same” stereotypes of Asian culture that most people don’t really perceive as being racist. It creates a kind of blind spot.",
		"13" : "And what I’ve come to understand is that the salad names are where that blind spot reveals itself. Even as the actual cuisines of Asia influence and sometimes appear to dominate American food culture — David Chang’s Momofuku restaurants, Roy Choi’s Kogi barbecue-fueled empire, ramen joints and izakaya and Mission Chinese Food by Danny Bowien — these stereotypes persist and control a lot of what’s on the menu in Middle America.",
		"14" : "In the ecosystem of the American restaurant menu, the dish checks a box for geographic and flavor diversity outside what company marketers understand to be the norm for their customers. To a white audience, it reads as diverse. To actual Asian-Americans, it reads as ridiculous. The blindness to this reality, I emphasize, is not restricted to the Asian salad (see Applebee’s “Fiesta lime chicken,” served with “Mexi-ranch” dressing).",
		"15" : "When I see an Oriental Chop Chop or a Secret Asian Man, I feel … weary. Because the language of the Asian salad is revealing of the dangers of bland, disembodied generalization: When you fail to see countries and cultures as discrete entities, what kind of consideration could you be expected to give to individual people?",
		"16" : "As for the dish itself — whether it’s called Asian, Chinese or Oriental — well, it’s acquired a life of its own, apart from actual Asians. The other day I tried a version of a “Chinese chicken salad” made by Wise Sons, a Jewish deli in San Francisco. The owners, Evan Bloom, Leo Beckerman and Mr. Bloom’s brother Ari, are three guys from Southern California who grew up eating Chinese chicken salad just about everywhere. Mr. Bloom’s early exposure to it? Wolfgang Puck.",
		"17" : "The salad has become a nostalgia trip for a whole generation of Jewish deli-goers. Mr. Bloom says that the recipe came from nowhere in particular. Sesame oil, soy sauce, mayo, sugar, sesame seeds; Napa cabbage, red cabbage, frisée, red onions, shredded carrots, thin sliced celery, chopped sushi ginger, orange segments, fried wonton skins, a little cilantro. It’s a riff on an idea, what Mr. Bloom himself tells me is “that sweet Asiany flavor that is a familiar taste to a lot of people, from Benihana or a Chinese restaurant — it’s been around for 30 years.”",
		"18" : "I find something bittersweet in this nostalgia for a fake fusion cuisine. Something created in the name of Asians by non-Asians has become a touchstone for non-Asians. I understand that it’s possible to feel fondness for a dish that is deeply inauthentic and I don’t resent that one bit. It has become its own thing. Just don’t call it Mr. Mao’s Chicken Surprise."

He has cavalierly reversed past positions and campaign promises to accommodate his message of the moment.",

Anything short of a robust critique of Mr. Trump by Mr. Obama would be seen as not caring about the millions of people who have benefited from Mr. Obama’s policies and executive actions.

There, a $700,000 house was on the low end of the market — “and that was a knock-down, start-from-scratch kind of place,” he said. His budget was up to $400,000. Norwalk was a realistic choice.",
		"4" : "Mr. Rhodes, 32, a University of Connecticut graduate who is now a financial products salesman in Shelton, Conn., studied listings for a few years. Early last fall, having saved diligently, he visited a three-bedroom house new to the market, not far from Norwalk Harbor.",

A friend suggested that the actor start selling Tupperware himself; another friend dared him to do it in drag. Mr. Andersson accepted the challenge, borrowed a wig and boots and began his transformation into the raunchy and energetic traveling Tupperware saleswoman Dixie.",
		"5" : "“It was a completely horrible, haphazard look,” he recalled, comparing the hairstyle to roadkill. “I refined her over time.”",
		"6" : "Tupperware sales skyrocketed, and a friend of Mr. Andersson’s, the director Tomas Caruso, suggested he adapt the party into a stage show, which eventually had its premiere at the 2004 New York International Fringe Festival. He then spent a few years selling Tupperware — establishing himself, he said, as the No. 1 sales representative in both the United States and Canada — while developing the show.",
		"7" : "In 2007 he took up residence for three months at Ars Nova, an incubator for young talent that has gone on to help jump-start Bridget Everett, Billy Eichner and the current Broadway musical “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.”",
		"8" : "Dixie’s Ars Nova engagement was directed by Alex Timbers, who later oversaw the innovative productions “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” and “Peter and the Starcatcher,” both of which transferred to Broadway after smaller-scale runs.",
		"9" : "Mr. Andersson took Dixie on tour in 2008, and with the help of booking and press agents, landed gigs for the next two years. He recalled: ”When the booking company said, ‘It’s looking like we’re not going to book that much more,’ I said, ‘Great. I’m going to take a shot at it.’”",
		"10" : "“I thought, ‘This can’t be that hard,’” he added. “Somebody’s a tour booker, a manager, an agent. They’re not born with it. They go to school, they learn. If someone else can do it, I can do it.”",
		"11" : "Multitasking is nothing new to Mr. Andersson. In fact, it’s reminiscent of his childhood: He worked his first paper route when he was 8 and consistently held part-time jobs through his adolescence.",
		"12" : "Now, at 47, he is co-owner and co-producer of a production company called Down South, which he describes as “the umbrella of all things Dixie.”",
		"13" : "What that means is hard work. For nine years, he has cold-called arts centers and performing arts spaces to get bookings. Some cities have been so welcoming that a sequel was called for in 2014: “Dixie’s Never Wear a Tube Top While Riding a Mechanical Bull (And 16 Other Things I Learned While I Was Drinking Last Thursday)”  does away with the Tupperware sales and dives into the character’s personal life and philosophies.",
		"14" : "“You’d think, 10 years in, that people know the show, it’s easy to get in any market, and it’s not,” he said. “Unless you’re one of the big, big shows, you’re still constantly knocking on doors.”",
		"15" : "Drag performances have inched closer to the mainstream since Mr. Andersson introduced Dixie, which cuts both ways. A one-man show with a set that can be packed into a Tupperware bin, “Dixie’s Tupperware Party” isn’t costly to produce, and Mr. Andersson has worked determinedly to establish its name recognition. He knocked on doors in Nashville for four years until “Dixie” was booked there.",
		"16" : "But despite a national presence, investors were reluctant to back Mr. Andersson for an Off Broadway run of “Dixie’s Tupperware Party” last September. He had hoped to bring the show, which has been updated since Ars Nova, back to New York. “They just weren’t interested,” he said.",
		"17" : "To expand his audience, Mr. Andersson recently signed with the Gersh Agency, where the agent Matt Charkow will help book “Dixie’s Tupperware Party” into new spaces.",
		"18" : "“We’ve been able to place the show outside of the standard theatrical model that Kris has been accustomed to,” Mr. Charkow said. The coming tour includes one-night bookings along with lengthier runs at theaters, casinos and festivals.",
		"19" : "It cost $40,000 to produce “Dixie’s Tupperware Party” at Ars Nova for the three-month run, Mr. Andersson estimated, a total he “couldn’t even imagine” then. His touring advances at first totaled $25,000, but have grown over the years as high as $150,000 in a market. (His show runs about 90 minutes, and audiences can be as large as 1,500.)",
		"20" : "Now that he’s signed with Gersh, Mr. Andersson is relieved to have some more time on his hands. In the past he would spend several weeks in one city cultivating his fan base; now the stops are shorter with more cities on the itinerary, a cross between theater and stand-up comedy gigs.",
		"21" : "Determined to stay relevant, Mr. Andersson interacts with fans through grass-roots marketing and social media. “It’s one thing for an agent to be out selling a show,” Mr. Charkow said. “It’s another to actually be the character, and be in the trenches, so to speak.”",
		"22" : "It’s the force of that character — who won’t easily take no for an answer — that makes Mr. Charkow’s job a little easier. “She’s going to find her way to where she needs to go,” he said, “one way or another.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "My surfing instructor, Johnny Linares, was sizing up my form as one might look at an underwhelming used car on the dealer lot. “O.K.,” he said. “It’s not bad. But you have to push up faster and get on your feet. Get on your feet, my friend!”",
		"2" : "I was in a slick wet suit, facedown on an old stone bench near the Playa Makaha, a rocky beach close to the Parque del Amor in the Miraflores district of Peru’s capital, Lima. Mr. Linares, who has been surfing for 27 of his 40 years, had succeeded in wearing me out before we had even entered the water. Push up with the arms, he barked. Right foot on the board! Now stand all the way up! “Well,” he said, seeming less than encouraged, “I think we’ll just see how it goes in the water.”",
		"3" : "My lesson was not only an education, but also a respite from the intense urbanism of Lima, a city of 8.7 million people — one of the largest in the Americas. This ciudad de los reyes, or city of kings, as it’s sometimes called, traces its history to long before Pizarro arrived to conquer the Incas. Today, it’s truly an international city, with a wealth of sights, tastes and activities that connect the present with its ancient past (all on a relatively inexpensive budget, of course). I also met people like Mr. Linares, who, while perhaps unable to mold me into the next Duke Kahanamoku, did his best, demonstrating both a kindness and a doggedness of spirit that I repeatedly encountered elsewhere in the city.",
		"4" : "My transfer from the Lima international airport, which I arranged with my hotel, went smoothly. Pumas Casa, which I booked through Booking.com for $35 per night, or about 115 Peruvian soles, offered a pickup service for $17. (As with all of its reservations, the site acted as a facilitator. Expect to pay in dollars or local currency when you arrive.) I was landing close to midnight and didn’t want to worry about transport, and I’m glad I had arranged the pickup — the onslaught of taxi drivers pushing their services can be overwhelming.",
		"5" : "My driver, Jorge, was a pensive man who had one thing on his mind: the recent coastal El Niño and the havoc it wrought in towns north of Lima. Many had died, he said. Unusually warm waters had triggered rains in areas that hadn’t seen such precipitation in decades. The Rimac River, a vital source of potable water for Lima, he said, was in bad shape because of the storms and huaycos — flash floods — and resulting runoff.",
		"6" : "It had an effect on parts of the city as well. My hostess at Pumas Casa (which seems to have changed its name since I stayed there, and is now called Khallma Casa Boutique), Claudia Alatrista, put her hands together. “There is no water right now,” she said. Because of the huaycos, a large swath of the city had been without running water for the last two days. Some other hotels might have water reserves, she said, but she did not.",
		"7" : "“If you want to go somewhere else, it’s O.K.,” she said. I told her I would stay. “I’m so glad!” she said, and clapped. She went into the kitchen and poured me a glass of bottled water. She set it in front of me almost ceremonially and watched as I drank it, as if to say: “This is precious. It’s everywhere and it’s nowhere.”",
		"8" : "My accommodation at Pumas Casa, a small double room with a shared bathroom down the hall, needed better ventilation but was acceptable for the price. I also stayed in lodgings that fell on the pricier end of the frugal spectrum, an $80-per-night room at the Atrium Miraflores, a boutique hotel near the Parque Central. The Atrium Miraflores was more comfortable than Pumas Casa but less homey. For example, I was scolded by the front desk at Atrium Miraflores for bringing a friend, a woman named Pam, up to my room.",
		"9" : "“Excuse me,” came a voice through the phone, no less than 90 seconds after we had arrived in my room with some sandwiches from La Lucha Sanguchería Criolla on the other side of the park. (The La Lucha sandwich, made with Edam cheese, onions and juicy, thinly pounded sirloin for 18.90 soles, was quite satisfying.) “But if your friend is going to stay here, she’s going to have to register with her passport.” I assured the voice that my friend was just visiting.",
		"10" : "Pam was working at Panadería El Pan de la Chola, a bakery on Mariscal La Mar Avenue. She said washing dishes with a trickle of bottled water was challenging, to say the least. Nevertheless, the croissants were miraculously flaky considering the heat and humidity, and buttery with a chewy sourdough tang — well worth the 6 soles.",
		"11" : "What Peru is best known for is its seafood, particularly its ceviches. At Barra Chalaca, a cute place with outdoor seating on Camino Real Avenue, an excellent, powerfully tart and fruity ceviche with lisa (mullet), a fistful of fried calamari, sweet potato and choclo (giant Peruvian corn) set me back 29 soles (less than $9). Also interesting: the chaufa tapado, a nod to Chifa cuisine, a combination of Chinese and Peruvian traditions commonly found in Lima. A huge portion of savory fried rice topped with a shrimp omelet cost 32 soles.",
		"12" : "The best seafood of the trip, though, was at Al Toke Pez, a hole in the wall that Pam introduced me to. This cramped, single-counter restaurant had all the hallmarks of a local must-visit place: stuffy, entirely too hot and uncomfortable, and packed with people. We slid into the corner and watched the chef, Tomas Matsufuji, do his thing. He worked quietly and deliberately, eyes closed as he shook a sauté pan on the stove, flames dancing perilously near his face.",
		"13" : "A small leche de tigre for 4 soles was a perfect aperitif — fishy and almost too tangy. A ceviche mixto (15 soles) with mullet, cuttlefish and prawn was fresh and fruity, and preceded the outstanding main course: an entire collar of róbalo, or bass. The tender, flaky meat was cooked perfectly, and the outside fried golden brown in a bath of butter and garlic. It was easily the best thing I ate on the trip, and for the money (40 soles), one of the best plates of seafood I’ve ever had.",
		"14" : "Also good, but not nearly so frugal, is the more upscale El Mercado restaurant. “Upscale” is a relative term: You can still gorge yourself on outstanding seafood for about $30 per person. I recommend the conchas del griego, savory scallops with the creamy roe sacks still attached, for 48 soles.",
		"15" : "A reality check lay ahead, in Lima’s main plaza. I headed to Jirón de la Unión, a shopping street and pedestrian mall, and found myself in the beautiful Plaza Mayor, flanked by ornate and impressive buildings on all sides: the Palacio del Gobierno (the president’s residence), the Palacio Municipal (city hall) and the huge Cathedral of Lima, completed in 1622. And just around the corner from the plaza was a government truck.",
		"16" : "“Cola! Cola!” people at the back of the line were yelling to would-be cutters; “cola” means “line.” Dozens of men, women and children were carrying buckets, pails, plastic basins and even barrels, waiting for water from a tanker truck on the side of the road. Nerves and patience wore thin. At a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts, an employee named Geraldine said that her neighborhood, San Juan de Lurigancho, still had running water, and that she felt bad for the people who had been without it for the past several days. “El río anda sucia,” she said — the river is dirty — and shrugged as if to say, what can you do?",
		"17" : "Pam and I met Tito Miranda, a lifelong Lima resident, at Juanito de Barranco, a cozy bar in the Barranco neighborhood. He noted the city’s water predicament, but his spirits were high, as were ours: We had just had a savory ham sandwich for 10 soles and a big draft beer for 7.50.",
		"18" : "Outside and across the street, Barranco’s own Plaza de Armas (different than central Lima’s main square) was a hub of activity, with musicians, street vendors selling anticuchos (beef heart skewers) and people singing and dancing. Nearby is the Puente Suspiros, or Bridge of Sighs, under which you can pass and head down a path toward the coast to take in a stunning sunset.",
		"19" : "History and culture run deep in Lima — about as deep as you’re willing to venture. At Huaca Pucllana (admission, 12 soles), an archaeological site right in the heart of the city, I learned about Lima’s pre-Hispanic culture and saw an adobe pyramid roughly 1,500 years old.",
		"20" : "The catacombs museum of the Convent of San Francisco is another fascinating slice of history, and I explored a maze of Franciscan crypts dating to the 1600s, seeing skulls and femurs along the way. Admission is only 10 soles, but prepare for a long visit: You’re required to have a guide, and the process can last a couple of hours. I got a bit impatient at having to go on a lengthy church tour before getting to see the fun stuff.",
		"21" : "Mr. Linares, my surf instructor, on the other hand, seemed to have nothing but patience. (My lesson, which included brief training on dry land and 90 minutes in the water, cost 50 soles.) I was worn out from paddling my surfboard, but he pushed himself and me along, deeper into the Pacific. I hadn’t been able to stand up on the board yet, and was getting discouraged.",
		"22" : "“Here comes a good one,” he said. “Are you ready?” I wasn’t. “Paddle! Paddle!” he shouted. I paddled as hard as my dead trapezius muscles would let me, put my right foot on the board, then my left. I was, somehow, standing. The salty air kissed my face, the sun shone warmly on my black wet suit, and I was doing it: I was surfing.",
		"23" : "For exactly four seconds. I planted face first into the water, and a successive wave added insult to injury, knocking my board into my head. I was defeated. But Johnny didn’t think so. “You did it,” he said. “That was amazing, my friend! You were really surfing!” He said it so convincingly and enthusiastically that I began to believe him."

		"1" : "A flamboyant herd of concrete goats seem to strut their stuff across Socrates Sculpture Park on the waterfront in Long Island City, Queens. Part of the exhibition “Nari Ward: G.O.A.T., again,” each goat has a shaft of rebar shooting up from its back that’s embellished with materials. Some are adorned with dazzling gold leaf or an extravagant pompadour of hairy black palm. The one Mr. Ward calls “the social media goat” sprouts a tangle of electric cords and has a body tinted red, white and blue. Another, tarred and feathered, stands alone.",
		"2" : "The goat can be a loaded symbol, according to Mr. Ward, 53, who was born in Jamaica and now lives in Harlem with his wife and two children. He likes to elicit association, memory, history and politics through installations and large-scale sculptures laden with commonplace and often-discarded objects that he collects from the streets. At his studio and home in a former fire station, he described how the goat can be perceived as a sacrificial animal as well as an image of debauchery, as humble or arrogant, an insult or a boast. Musicians and athletes often use G.O.A.T. as an acronym for Greatest of All Time.",
		"3" : "After Donald J. Trump won the election, Mr. Ward thought the goat seemed like the suitable form for populating the public park. “Audacity was in the air, with this ego running rampant,” said Mr. Ward, a natural storyteller with an easy sense of humor. He had intended to do something “absurdist and ridiculous” with chickens after being offered the Socrates commission last summer but scrapped that plan in November.",
		"4" : "“I didn’t feel playful anymore,” he said, emphasizing that the idea is bigger than the new president. “There was something urgent that I needed to talk about. The title ‘G.O.A.T., again’ is referencing the small-minded concept of history that you’re the Greatest of All Time.”",
		"5" : "“What’s universal,” he said, “is the notion of a savior, the notion of a charlatan, the abuse of power and manipulation.”",
		"6" : "Splayed across the center of the park is a 40-foot-long hobbyhorse with a colossal faux-stone goat’s head. Titled “Scapegoat,” a term that goes back to the Bible, the sculpture is like a caricature of a political monument or the abandoned plaything of a deity. Mr. Ward imagines the outsize animal as part of a play “where the main character is killed.” Whether “Scapegoat” is meant to be worshiped, ostracized or mourned is left ambiguous. “It’s up the viewer to figure out their role in that,” said Mr. Ward, who likes to keep his imagery open-ended enough to invite multiple readings.",
		"7" : "“The goats become the ambassadors for the conversation,” he added.",
		"8" : "Indeed, Mr. Ward seems to be courting public opinion in the park with a giant glowing sign that spells “Apollo,” like the Harlem theater. But in Mr. Ward’s version, the first and last letters blink to flip the message to “poll,” a word linked to the 2016 election. “It’s the linchpin of the show,” said Mr. Ward, connecting the theater’s Amateur Night, where the crowd cheers contestants or boos them off the stage, with the protests, rallies and social media eruptions across the American landscape.",
		"9" : "“G.O.A.T., again” marks the first time a single artist has taken on the entire five-acre park. The executive director of Socrates Sculpture Park, John Hatfield, felt Mr. Ward was the right artist for the challenge. “It’s a rarity to have an artist immersively occupy an outdoor space with works that can amplify one another,” Mr. Hatfield said. “Nari often combines two aspects masterfully — a darkness that leads you into a critique of the social strata with the joyousness of a toy or celebratory aspect of scale — and then lets people create their own stories.”",
		"10" : "For Mr. Ward, who just had a midcareer traveling museum survey open at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, working outside the white cube of the gallery is a return to how he started.",
		"11" : "In 1993, during a residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem after receiving his master of fine arts degree at Brooklyn College, he began collecting abandoned baby strollers from the streets. They were a poignant symbol to him of disrupted lives. Staging his own exhibition in a rented fire station (where he moved in 1999), he clustered 365 strollers and carved out an ellipse-shaped pathway lined with fire hose. The installation suggested both a vulva and a ship’s hull. Titled “Amazing Grace” — a song that permeated the space in a haunting loop — it evoked journeys both painful and transcendent and helped develop Mr. Ward’s approach to assembling found objects rich with past lives and stories.",
		"12" : "Cecilia Alemani, who commissioned Mr. Ward’s “Smart Tree” for the High Line last year, called Mr. Ward “a poet of urban transformation.”",
		"13" : "“Nari’s able to chronicle the life of the city and the people who live in the cities through the objects that they use and leave behind,” she said. He stopped traffic on the High Line with his sculpture of a car propped on cinder blocks and covered with a patchwork of cut tires that became a giant vase for an apple tree. It was based on a childhood memory of his father buying a broken car that he intended to fix but left sitting so long in his yard in Jamaica that it sprouted a tree.",
		"14" : "“There was quite an element of hope,” Ms. Alemani said.",
		"15" : "This year Mr. Ward won the $100,000 Vilcek Prize, awarded annually to an immigrant artist who has contributed significantly to American culture. He came from Jamaica at 12 with his family, first to Brooklyn and then Parsippany, N.J. There, his mother worked as a housekeeper for Fred Schwartz — famous locally for his “Fred the Furrier” TV ads in the 1970s — and the family lived with Mr. Schwartz’s mentally handicapped brother-in-law. “It became my job to take care of Howie,” Mr. Ward said. “I felt this weird sense of protection for him. It was my tour of duty.”",
		"16" : "The works in Mr. Ward’s museum survey, which opened in 2015 at the Pérez Art Museum Miami and also traveled to the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, explore clichés of Caribbean culture, the simultaneous visibility and invisibility of black men on city streets, and ideas of migration, struggle and ascension. Ruth Erickson, associate curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, who coordinated the presentation there, said she “could not have imagined how newly timely Nari’s survey would be in our current political moment.”",
		"17" : "“Naturalization Drawing Table” from 2004 shows the procrastinatory doodles Mr. Ward made on an Immigration and Naturalization Service form the first time he set out to become a citizen. “The work I was making was questioning what it means to be an American, in response to post 9/11 fervor and distancing ourselves from other people,” Mr. Ward said. “I thought I needed to get my citizenship if I wanted to critique this country that I love.”",
		"18" : "He finally completed the process in 2012 after multiple starts and stops.",
		"19" : "His drawing table will be activated on May 4, when visitors to the show can receive an edition set of Mr. Ward’s elaborate doodles in return for filling out the I.N.S. form and having a passport photo taken on-site. The notarized applications will then be hung on the wall of the museum and become a permanent part of the piece.",
		"20" : "Participation is also weaved into a billboard-size installation in which thousands of shoelaces spell the first words of the Constitution, “We the People,” originally conceived in 2011 using hand-dyed laces. Mr. Ward was persuaded by the philanthropist Diana DiMenna to make a new version this year as a permanent acquisition for the New-York Historical Society after landing on the idea of collecting used shoelaces from among the 200,000 schoolchildren who visit the society annually. “We wanted people, and especially children, to be able to put themselves literally into the narrative of what it means to be ‘we the people’,” Ms. DiMenna said. On view in the lobby, “We the People” has been integrated into the society’s curriculum on constitutional history and is a pit stop for visiting school groups.",
		"21" : "This month a frequent visitor to Socrates Sculpture Park watched Mr. Ward installing “Bipartition Bell,” a bulbous organic shape made of hammered copper dangling from a steel frame and reminiscent of the Liberty Bell. The man called out to Mr. Ward, asking him if it was testicles “you have hanging up there.” The artist pretended not to hear, but then told the man it was an “upside-down heart.” Finally he sheepishly admitted it was indeed modeled on a goat scrotum.",
		"22" : "“It’s this massive organ that’s about virility and potentiality,” said Mr. Ward, who will also have a gallery exhibition at Lehmann Maupin in June. While his sculpture seems to promise a resounding gong, viewers who duck their heads inside the bell will find only the tiniest billy goat chime that they can ring. Mr. Ward said he’s playing with the idea of “unfulfilled expectations,” something he feels many Americans are currently experiencing. For black Americans, he said, it has long been “the norm.”",
		"23" : "“When what you want to happen doesn’t happen, how do you then deal with the shortcomings?” he asked. “I think artists are good at shedding light on emotional spaces that are buried because they’re painful to revisit.”",
		"24" : "Yet he never wants to leave viewers without a silver lining. In Mr. Ward’s goat-land, where testicles can be read as a heart, the little bell inside may be a letdown, or a seed of hope."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "When the star soprano Diana Damrau joined the Virgin Classics label in 2006, she met its president, Alain Lanceron, after a performance. He asked what she’d like to record. A Mozart and Salieri collection, she answered — and an album of the once-celebrated, now-neglected 19th-century German opera composer Giacomo Meyerbeer.",
		"2" : "More than a decade later, “Grand Opera,” whose title pays tribute to the genre of which Meyerbeer was the master, will be released on Friday, May 5. It’s a departure for Ms. Damrau, a singer who mostly hews to the standards. But in a tough environment for selling records, esoteric is in.",
		"3" : "“These days you have to find new ideas for recordings,” Mr. Lanceron said by phone recently. “Not just the same old arias.”",
		"4" : "Few things could be further from the same old arias than Meyerbeer (1791-1864). Hardly a corner of the repertory has grown mustier, a puzzling development given the composer’s prominence during his lifetime. In his heyday, Meyerbeer was a uniquely powerful hitmaker, as well as an innovator who brought opera to new levels of orchestral color, dramatic scale, choral mass, historical richness and theatrical dazzle.",
		"5" : "In a series of works for the Paris Opera, beginning with “Robert le Diable” (1831), Meyerbeer systematically deepened the art form and how it was created. Writing a libretto, formerly a text dashed off in a few weeks, became a full collaboration between a composer and a librettist that could take years. Dramaturges and stage directors had roles of new significance. Meyerbeer helped invent the idea of tailoring dramatic and musical structures to each work, giving a courtly French tinge to “Les Huguenots” (1836); rougher, darker Teutonic tones to “Le Prophète” (1849); and perfumed lyricism to evoke the Portuguese and Indian settings of “L’Africaine” (1865).",
		"6" : "“Without him, Wagner is unthinkable, and much of Verdi,” Leon Botstein, who conducted a revival of “Les Huguenots” at Bard College in 2009, said in an interview. “He and Rossini invent 19th-century opera.”",
		"7" : "But in the decades after his death, Meyerbeer began to disappear from opera houses, one of the most important and influential composers ever to be so completely marginalized. He became better known as the object of Wagner’s vicious, anti-Semitic disdain than for his music. With their seemingly old-fashioned artificiality, his works grew dogged by a reputation for unbearable length and vacuous spectacle. By the turn of the 20th century, George Bernard Shaw could write: “Nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer’s influence seriously.”",
		"8" : "The Metropolitan Opera last performed a Meyerbeer opera in 1979: “Le Prophète,” mounted for Marilyn Horne. “L’Africaine”? Not since 1934. “Les Huguenots” was possibly the most successful opera of the 19th century, the first to reach 1,000 performances at the Paris Opera. But performances trailed off over the past century. The Met last put it on in 1915. “Why the Met doesn’t do it is astonishing,” Mr. Botstein said of “Les Huguenots.” “And it’s completely relevant because it’s about religious fanaticism. This is about people killing each other over religious belief.”",
		"9" : "But while the Met has not yet shown signs of budging, a critical re-evaluation has been accompanied by recent glimmers of a renaissance. The Deutsche Oper in Berlin is in the midst of a cycle of Meyerbeer classics, with “Le Prophète” to come in November; when the company did “Les Huguenots” in the fall, Opera News observed that the staging was one of three productions of the piece in Germany this season. Laurent Pelly’s 2012 staging of “Robert le Diable” returned that work to the Royal Opera House in London for the first time since 1890. A 1988 San Francisco production of “L’Africaine” with Plácido Domingo has just been rereleased on DVD.",
		"10" : "Ms. Damrau’s invaluable “Grand Opera,” with Emmanuel Villaume conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Lyon Opera, doesn’t just include arias and scenes from the better-known (that is to say, known-at-all) pieces. The disc also exposes true rarities like “Alimelek” and “Emma di Resburgo,” products of Meyerbeer’s early forays into Italy and Germany, before his triumphant maturity in France.",
		"11" : "And this won’t be the extent of Ms. Damrau’s commitment to the composer: She is scheduled to star a few years from now in what will be a hotly anticipated new production of “Les Huguenots” at the Paris Opera with the tenor Bryan Hymel, who sang the title role in that recent London “Robert le Diable” and in 2015 released “Héroïque,” a French grand opera album.",
		"12" : "Born Jacob Liebmann Beer, Meyerbeer — as a young man he combined his maternal and paternal family names — was a child of the Prussian Jewish elite; both his parents were influential at the royal court.",
		"13" : "He was a virtuoso pianist before he found fame as a composer, fully embracing opera during a long early stretch in Italy. (It was a homage to his successes there that he began to go by Giacomo instead of Jacob.) With “Il Crociato in Egitto” (1824), he grew so celebrated that, when discussing the possibilities of creating an opera out of “Faust,” Goethe said that he wanted someone “like Meyerbeer” to compose it.",
		"14" : "But it was only once he began writing for the Paris Opera, which had the world’s most impressive resources, that he made his full impact. With “Les Huguenots,” about the battle between Protestants and Catholics in 16th-century France, Meyerbeer began to see opera not as the play of individuals, but as a grander, more impersonal spectacle. “His historical operas are not simply based on historical subjects,” the scholar Matthias Brzoska has written, “but take the historical process itself as their subject.” The activity of large, anonymous crowds became his focal point, obliging an entirely new approach to the chorus and giving rise to the thrilling antiphonal explosions of the third-act finale of “Les Huguenots” and the organ-spiked coronation scene in “Le Prophète.”",
		"15" : "To match this musical majesty, Meyerbeer demanded revolutionary advances in stage technology. One of the first onstage uses of an electric spotlight brought to life a sunrise in “Le Prophète”; for its scandalous ballet for the sex-crazed ghosts of nuns, “Robert le Diable” featured perhaps the first realistically moonlit — that is, lit from above — night. The scenery for “Les Huguenots” cost 66,000 francs, more than double the price of Rossini’s sweeping “Guillaume Tell” just seven years earlier. The premiere production of “L’Africaine,” after Meyerbeer’s death, featured the first completely revolving stage set and a fantastically realistic shipwreck.",
		"16" : "Recordings obviously can’t do justice to this aspect of his operas, but Ms. Damrau’s new album, nearly an hour and a half of music, has its own lavish exuberance. Coloratura showpieces, like “Ombre légère” from “Le Pardon de Ploërmel,” share the disc with extended scenes from “Les Huguenots” and “L’Africaine” and, in what may be its first recording, the meaty “Lebe wohl, geliebte Schwester” from “Ein Feldlager in Schlesien.”",
		"17" : "It’s fascinating work — so why Meyerbeer’s slow fade? Wagner, and what he came to represent, is key. Meyerbeer was generous toward the younger, characteristically obsequious composer when Wagner was starting out. But some combination of factors — Meyerbeer’s religion, the privations of Wagner’s exile from Germany after a leftist uprising, Wagner’s need to reject an artistic father figure — turned the younger man. In his grotesque 1850 pamphlet “Jewishness in Music,” he condemned Meyerbeer without naming him: “The uninspiring, the truly laughable, is the characteristic mark whereby this famed composer shows his Jewishness in his music.” A year later, in “Opera and Drama,” he sneered at Meyerbeer’s “effects without causes.”",
		"18" : "Used to having enemies, Meyerbeer bore the attacks with equanimity, continuing to speak well of Wagner and his work. But with Wagner ascendant, it was perhaps inevitable that Meyerbeer would decline.",
		"19" : "And his withering from the repertory wasn’t simply because of injustice. The demands he placed on singers made his works daunting to cast. His plots can be thin, though it has been argued that this was more or less intentional, a way of highlighting social and historical processes rather than individual interactions.",
		"20" : "Processes aren’t the path to modern popularity. Rossini, even serious, is more ingratiatingly personal. Henry Blaze de Bury, a Meyerbeer advocate, wrote that “he uplifts, he stirs, but hardly has what we commonly call the gift of tears” — the gift, in other words, of what many want from opera.",
		"21" : "But Meyerbeer may be just the composer for our moment, not just in his subject matter but also in his almost proto-postmodern resistance to the fully immersive naturalism that would become the operatic norm after Wagner. Our taste for movies in which the protagonist, say, addresses the viewer (think Ferris Bueller) and novels that draw attention to novelistic conventions has much to do with his style. Meyerbeer was the master of a kind of detachment that paradoxically heightened his theatrical power.",
		"22" : "“He keeps the audience on the edge of their seats by not releasing them from the fact that they’re half on the stage and half in their seats,” Mr. Botstein said. “He doesn’t believe this is a kind of narcotic escape.”",
		"23" : "He continues to inspire passionate partisans. The final pages of “L’Africaine,” Robert Ignatius Letellier wrote in his introduction to Meyerbeer’s diaries, “break through the bounds of time, space and history to perceive a spiritual sphere, a pure realm of love where all are equal.”",
		"24" : "Hyperbole? Modern audiences should get the chance to decide for themselves."

		"1" : "On a cold night in January, in a dark alley off Great Jones Street in Manhattan, Bruce Wayne was getting ready to fly.",
		"2" : "This was the young, pre-Batman Bruce Wayne of the Fox series “Gotham,” played by David Mazouz, then 15. As a stunt double was strapped into an elaborate rig and repeatedly flung backward 30 feet — the result of a punch from a powerful shaman holding Bruce captive — Mr. Mazouz waited his turn a bit uncertainly.",
		"3" : "Standing next to him, Ben McKenzie, the show’s star, offered encouragement with a story from his days playing high school football. The shoot, for the 16th episode of the third season — “Heroes Rise: These Delicate and Dark Obsessions,” on Monday, May 1 — was unusual in a couple of ways. It was the first episode directed by Mr. McKenzie, who plays James Gordon, a Gotham City detective — not yet the police commissioner of the comic books.",
		"4" : "And, surprisingly for a superhero series, it was the first of the show’s 60 episodes so far to make extensive use of wire work for action scenes. Referring to the show’s creator, Bruno Heller, and showrunner, Danny Cannon, Mr. McKenzie said: “One of the things that I said to Bruno and Danny when we first started the show was: ‘No wire work.’ None of this baloney like people flying through the air. It’s Batman, it’s supposed to feel a little more grounded, it’s supposed to feel more like the Christopher Nolan films. So, of course, I’m the one director that brings in the wires.”",
		"5" : "“Gotham” was a different sort of comic-book show from the start. Conceived as 100 percent origin story — how Bruce Wayne became Batman — it was a superhero series without a superhero. The protagonist was Gordon, a cop whose only superpower was his sense of justice. The format was closer to police procedural than the angst-and-battles of most comic-book shows.",
		"6" : "In the absence of a larger-than-life hero, the show compensated by featuring its villains, including future Batman foes like the Penguin, the Riddler and a prototype of the Joker. Robin Lord Taylor, as Oswald Cobblepot, a thug who rises to become the Penguin, was the show’s breakout performer. Complementing the emphasis on villainy and the story’s film-noir roots have been a dark tone and a high level of violence, particularly for a broadcast-network show.",
		"7" : "Despite those differences — or perhaps because of them — “Gotham” has been a bit lost in the shuffle amid the proliferation of superhero series the last five years. On one side, it’s overshadowed by Netflix series like “Jessica Jones” and “Daredevil,” which also go for a dark tone but stick closer to the singular-hero comic-book imperative (and which have benefited from the cachet of both Netflix and Marvel Comics). On the other, it gets less attention (though more viewers) than the more lightweight, purely comics-style shows on CW like “The Flash” and “Supergirl” (based, like “Gotham,” on DC Comics characters).",
		"8" : "Ranking the superhero shows is difficult because they are so different. “Jessica Jones” stands out for the quality of its writing and performances, while “The Flash,” at times, is the most purely exhilarating. But if you like the dark version of Batman popularized in the comics by Frank Miller and onscreen by Mr. Nolan, then “Gotham,” with its grimness and its distinctive (and expensive) retro visual style, measures up.",
		"9" : "“At first you’re trying to figure out what the show isn’t,” Mr. McKenzie said. “We wanted to be, very specifically, not a show with true ‘superheroes’ dressed in white tights, running faster than the speed of light. There’s so many of them out there. Now that we know what the show is, we break our own rules a bit.”",
		"10" : "Mr. McKenzie — who had wanted to direct since his tenure on TNT’s “Southland,” which was canceled before he had the chance — said his episode was more quiet than most. “The only constructive criticism I got was that it was ‘still,’” he said. “Which is one of the things I like.” But that stillness incorporated not just a decapitation but several shootings, an attack with a garden tool and a suicide.",
		"11" : "“You know, it had some violence,” he acknowledged. As director, he handled one bloody scene by focusing primarily on the face of the aggressor, the Penguin.",
		"12" : "“I like it when our show is able to go to wherever we need to go to, violence-wise, but with a certain, let’s call it class,” he said. “There’s always knifing and dicing in the show, but even that’s relatively elegant. So that’s how I tried to handle that.”",
		"13" : "Mr. McKenzie’s episode was the second half of a pair that began with “How the Riddler Got His Name,” in which the character Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) assumed his comic-book persona. An important part of the Riddler story was the death of a woman he loved — the latest in a long line of female deaths on the show.",
		"14" : "“Right, right,” Mr. McKenzie said as he listened to a list of female victims. “Nygma’s lover died because that was our way of marking his change from a studious and reserved lab technician to a full-fledged version of the Riddler. People can criticize the show any way they like. My concern is always, are they dying for a reason? Whichever gender.”",
		"15" : "You might not find that answer satisfactory, but there’s a basic truth to it: The show is what it is, a violent, male-centric comic-book adaptation (with, to be fair, several female characters who are stronger and more menacing than most such shows can boast).",
		"16" : "Viewership for “Gotham” has slipped from season to season, currently running about five million in the seven-day ratings. Fox hasn’t announced whether there will be a fourth season. Whenever the show ends, Mr. McKenzie was asked, can we expect the superhero to finally appear?",
		"17" : "“Yeah, sure,” he said. “Mustache, klieg light, Batman.”",
		"18" : "He added: “It doesn’t matter what the other shows do. ‘Gotham’ is taking the biggest piece of red meat in the comics world, Batman, and trying to take this one specific sliver of it and cook it really, really well and serve it to you. I always hope we’re Steve McQueen in the classic car with the bomber jacket. An archetypal show.”"

		"1" : "At the start of “Catastrophe,” Sharon (an Irish schoolteacher played by Sharon Horgan) and Rob (an American ad man played by Rob Delaney) meet in a London bar and proceed to have loads of sex, most of it unprotected. “A terrible thing has happened,” he tells her after learning that their six-night bacchanal has resulted in pregnancy. “Let’s make the best of it.” And with that, one of television’s funniest, filthiest, most realistic takes on the sweet mess of coupledom and parenting was born.",
		"2" : "Ms. Horgan, 46, the Irish writer and actress, gave raw, ribald voice to the tumult of relationships. She even made nursing bras erotic. And she knows whence she writes: Now a mother of two daughters, she discovered she was pregnant six months into dating her husband, Jeremy Rainbird, an ad man at the time. Nope, it wasn’t planned.",
		"3" : "Season 3 of “Catastrophe,” debuting Friday, April 28, on Amazon, finds the spouses exactly where they left off — with a receipt for a Plan B pill and a guilty conscience — and adds secret drinking, employment woes and financial struggles to the mire. “We wanted to make their life hard, not just for the fun of watching people having to deal with that but also because that feels like reflective of what’s happening in the world at the moment,” said Ms. Horgan, who lives in London but was speaking by phone from Atlanta, where she is shooting a movie. “Things are getting tougher, and people are having to dig deep.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.",
		"4" : "Carrie Fisher played Rob’s  blunt, manipulative mom, with whom Sharon shares a mutual aversion. How are you dealing with her death?",
		"5" : "Carrie is hugely in Episode 6. Even though it’s just one episode, her presence is felt a lot more. It’s fun writing a monstrous character, absolutely. But we wanted to get under the skin a little bit more. We had only just finished filming a couple of days when we got the news. And it was horrible, and we were absolutely devastated, and at the same time feeling madly lucky to have come into contact with this incredible presence. God, she knew how to deliver a line.",

Yes, there’s definitely still bits and bobs in there that we’ve taken from our own lives. But you can’t stop those characters from becoming their own people.",

		"10" : "Couples watch that sparring in squirmy silence.",
		"11" : "I’ve had that comment a lot, and I love the idea of couples watching my shows together. But I always felt that would be uncomfortable because things are said — and if people haven’t said them, they’ve thought them.",

		"13" : "Oh gosh, you have to use your imagination more about the beginning of one. It’s a very fun, sweet thing to write about two people falling in love, but I would say it comes more naturally to me to write about the dark side of it. Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO, said anyone who’s been long-term married could write about how it feels to want a divorce. And it’s a nice, vent-y thing. You can get things down on paper that you then don’t have to say out loud to the person you love.",

I have to work really hard to make sentences funny or find the “thing” in them. But he has this ability to open his mouth and just perfect dialogue comes out of it and 80 percent of it is vile [laughs] — and it goes straight in there."

		"1" : "THE GIVERS Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age By David Callahan 343 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95",
		"2" : "Imagine you have more money than you know what to do with. Not tens of millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions — billions even. After acquiring that dream villa on Lake Como, a vintage Bugatti and a seat on Elon Musk’s maiden voyage to Mars, what would you do with the rest of your fortune? Buy the Yankees? Pay the Kardashians to disappear? O.K. But then what? Among America’s ultrarich, more and more people are making the laudable, if not wholly selfless, decision to give it away.",
		"3" : "Much like the poor, philanthropists have always been with us. Certainly, the United States has enjoyed its share of Rockefellers and Carnegies over the years. But in “The Givers,” David Callahan aims to introduce a new breed of megadonors— more numerous, more aggressive and vastly richer than their forebears — poised to reshape American society to an unprecedented degree. This, he contends, should make everyone at least a teensy bit nervous.",
		"4" : "“The Givers” concerns itself with the tippy-top tiers of “the philanthrosphere.” We’re not talking here about bush-leaguers like Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation has to go scrounging for other people’s money. Callahan focuses on the biggest of big givers — people like Bill Gates, the Walton clan, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett, who actually struggle to give away their fortunes because the money multiplies faster than they can shovel it out the door. The book covers all the basics: Who are these people? Why do they give? What causes do they favor, and how much impact do they have?",
		"5" : "The founder and editor of the website Inside Philanthropy, Callahan clearly knows the game and its players. This has its drawbacks. Especially in the early going, the book can feel laundry listy. After spending a couple of pages ticking through top Wall Street givers, he assures readers: “I could name many additional donors coming out of finance, like Jeremy Grantham, Seth Klarman, Louis Bacon, George Roberts, Glenn Dubin, Kenneth Griffin, Michael Milken, Henry Kravis and Leon Black.” All right already. You know your stuff. Can we please move on?",
		"6" : "Happily, Callahan hustles through the preliminaries and into a sweeping exploration of what makes mega-givers tick, how they operate and how they differ from their predecessors. Today’s masters of the universe, for instance, are donating at a much younger age and taking a much more hands-on approach. Forget spending decades amassing piles of cash to be handed over in the twilight of life to endow some foundation. These folks want to start saving the world right now.",
		"7" : "Especially absorbing is Callahan’s probing of mega-givers’ psyches. Of course tech billionaires are all about risk-taking and disruption and tackling problems no one else is addressing. That’s how they got to be billionaires in the first place. (They are “more ready by disposition to embrace the adage that philanthropy ‘is society’s risk capital.’”) Wall Street donors are often drawn to the “stewardship model of philanthropy” and prefer to support well established institutions — universities, hospitals, land conservation trusts and so on. (“They’re more into charity than change.”) “Titans of the old economy” tend to be older, more methodical, less creative and more political.",
		"8" : "Another significant development is the growing focus on data. (Even the philanthrosphere, it seems, has been invaded by the quants.) Givers are demanding an ever-clearer picture of what’s working and how to get the biggest bang for their bucks. Callahan devotes a chapter to givers’ quest for “leverage points,” most notably the strategic use of the court system to effect change.",
		"9" : "As suggested by the book’s subtitle, Callahan is not here merely to praise the new philanthropists. His core mission is to sound the alarm about how even the best intentioned among them are distorting American society and eroding “the egalitarian ethos so core to our national identity.”",
		"10" : "By now, pretty much everyone recognizes the potentially corrupting aspects of big-dollar political giving. Callahan’s contention is that big-dollar philanthropy affords its purveyors even greater influence, with fewer downsides and vastly less accountability. Sinking millions into, say, a presidential campaign subjects givers to intense public scrutiny and may ultimately win them nothing. Funding a nonprofit to sway thinking on, say, climate change or marriage equality or school choice — pick your issue — is a lower-profile, less risky, more enduring investment.",
		"11" : "“The Givers” is not a big-P political book. While Callahan takes issue with ideologically motivated giving dressed up as philanthropy (and with politically minded nonprofits enjoying the same tax status as traditional charities), he endeavors to be bipartisan in his scolding. For every tale of a conservative pushing supply-side economics or traditional marriage via “charitable” giving, he spotlights a liberal bankrolling gun control or clean energy. One positive byproduct of the swelling pool of mega-givers, he notes, is the philanthrosphere’s growing ideological diversity. You may hate how Charles Koch doles out his billions but delight in how George Soros uses his. Or vice versa.",
		"12" : "Callahan stresses that it is not the specific aims of givers that make Big Philanthropy problematic so much as the fact that it’s, well, big. Rich people wielding inordinate clout in any sphere is profoundly undemocratic, he contends, repeatedly lamenting that philanthropy is “occupying a bigger seat at the table of power than at any time in the past century,” even as “ordinary Americans struggle to get their voices heard at all.” To the point of distraction, he asks “whether we think it’s O.K. overall for any philanthropists to have so much power to advance their own vision of a better society?”",
		"13" : "Indeed, the book can be exhausting in its quest to hammer home the warping nature of Big Philanthropy. By the time Callahan makes the case that charitable giving actually perpetuates dynastic influence more than simply leaving one’s offspring a big pile of cash, many readers will be ready to throw up their hands in exasperation. So now we’re supposed to fret about rich people being too socially conscious? What exactly does this guy want?",
		"14" : "For all his efforts toward partisan balance, Callahan has a clear political perspective. A co-founder of the progressive think tank Demos, he is an unapologetic fan of big government — which, as he sees it, is the proper shaper of society. Central to his concern about philanthropy’s clout is that it is waxing as government’s is waning. He warns in the prologue, “We face a future in which private donors — who are accountable to no one — may often wield more influence than elected public officials, who (in theory, anyway) are accountable to all of us.” (That “in theory” covers a multitude of sins. While it’s not Callahan’s aim to grapple with the gross dysfunction of our political system, his periodic touting of the oh-so-democratic accountability of public officials nonetheless comes off as vaguely credulous.)",
		"15" : "It is not until the epilogue that Callahan really lets his progressive flag fly. He offers a handful of reform ideas that will feel familiar to anyone who has followed the money-in-politics debate over the years: greater transparency (especially when it comes to the “dark philanthropic money” channeled through opaque vehicles like “donor-advised funds”), stricter tax guidelines and increased government regulation. (He suggests a new “office of charitable affairs” to help on that front.)",
		"16" : "With such prescriptions, Callahan seeks “to target the philanthropic behavior that’s most troubling, not hobble the sector as a whole.” But this also means that, as Callahan acknowledges, even the most ambitious of his reforms would do little to alter the fundamental nature, or spiraling influence, of the greater philanthrosphere.",
		"17" : "As Callahan sees it, the only way to knock us off the path of “benign plutocracy” is “to revive government as a dynamic agent of change” — which is the modest proposal he presents in literally his final three pages. Such a revival would involve huge shifts in spending priorities, tax hikes on the wealthy and an overhaul of agencies. In other words: It would require an entirely different political and social climate than the one we have. Then again, tackling seemingly intractable problems is what Big Philanthropy is all about. As such, it seems uncharitable to deny Callahan his dreams of a more egalitarian world.",
		"18" : "Many readers no doubt will share Callahan’s views on the dark side of Big Philanthropy, and his ideas for addressing it. But even those who don’t should give “The Givers” a go. Callahan offers a peek inside a rarefied, poorly understood world with ever greater power to remake the broader world. It’s an engaging, thought-provoking tour well worth the taking."

		"2" : "I was fascinated by Lesley Stahl’s reference (By the Book, April 16), while discussing Robert Caro’s books about Lyndon Johnson, to “the loneliness of the isolated hill country of central Texas” and to “those lonely Texas hills.” I’m curious as to whether these were Caro’s representations or Stahl’s interpretation of Caro’s prose. The Hill Country is, for most of its residents, a state of mind, and its inhabitants relish its solitude and silence, finding the area to be not only enchanting but spiritually nourishing. Non-Texans are too often possessed of a romantic notion of our state as a desolate and lonely territory, forlorn in its isolation, but the Hill Country is no more lonely or forlorn than the Adirondacks or the Atlantic shoreline of New England.",

		"7" : "Writers, book reviewers, editors, publishers and, above all, readers need to frame the last paragraph of Seth Mnookin’s review of “High Anxiety,” by Sharon Begley (March 12) as a reminder of what we have lost and are losing. “For some inexplicable reason,” Mnookin wrote, “she neglected to include source notes, a bibliography or any supporting material whatsoever. … With “more and more people swayed by fantasy, it’s crucial that those of us who still believe in facts show why it is that we’re trustworthy.”",
		"8" : "I share Mnookin’s “compulsive need to know why writers are confident their conclusions are correct” and bemoan the increasing number of nonfiction works that do not have adequate footnote or endnote citations or bibliographies. The first step on this slippery slope was when footnotes became endnotes. The decline continued when footnotes were no longer numbered, and instead the reader, if she was lucky, would find in the back of the book a page number and a shortened quotation — too often not the controversial or incomplete assertion she hoped to trace. Now even nonfiction history is published without any notes (because it is “popular”?). When educators are attempting to teach students to “go to the source,” writers, reviewers, editors and publishers need to be sure that these sources can be located. It is their duty to the reader.

That may reflect the influence of Ruth Lyons, whose talk show, “Ruth Lyons 50-50 Club” was broadcast on TV in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky at noon. Lyons, a pioneer of radio and TV, held court with a bouquet-covered microphone, leading discussions with her regulars, introducing the singers and chatting with her band leader. Visiting stars to the area stopped by. Lyons did not suffer fools gladly and she was never shy with her opinions. The regulars called her “Mother.”",
		"13" : "I have read before that Dave, home from elementary school for lunch, watched this show with his mother. Steve Allen and Jack Paar, and probably Arthur Godfrey, all played in his boy’s brain as he developed his brand. But my money for the strongest influence is likely to have been Ruth Lyons, a grilled cheese sandwich and some chicken noodle soup. That combo, while sitting by his mother in front of the TV in the 1950s, set him on his successful path.",

		"17" : "The distinction between elitist and popular art (Bookends, April 16) is another academic polarity like classical versus romantic and modern versus postmodern. All of the arts were originally forms of popular culture. In ancient Greece the theater was for everyone. Later, the novel was leisure reading for the middle class. Then the arts were co-opted by intellectual elites who further distinguished between high and low culture, resulting in such dichotomies as cinema versus film, ballet versus dance, literary versus popular fiction, poetry versus verse and theater versus Broadway.",
		"18" : "In making such artificial distinctions, the elites turned the arts into a reflection of themselves, telling us which is which and why we should privilege one over the other. Once in Rome I heard a woman from the cleaning staff at my hotel singing “Un bel di” from “Madama Butterfly” as if it were a pop song. She knew the aria but perhaps could never afford to see the opera from which it came. All the arts once belonged to the people.

		"1" : "LIVING IN THE WEATHER OF THE WORLD By Richard Bausch 242 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.",
		"2" : "Richard Bausch’s “Letter to a Young Writer” is a literary call to arms that’s been passed around for years. Containing the Ten Commandments of the writing life, it offers advice on everything from how and what to read to acknowledging the importance of accepting failure along the way. Coming in at No. 3 on his list is a quote from Flaubert: “Be regular and ordinary in your habits, like a petit bourgeois, so you may be violent and original in your work.”",
		"3" : "Looking at Bausch’s career as a whole — and his new story collection in particular — it’s clear that he has followed his own advice. With 12 novels and eight story collections published since 1980, he’s managed to send original fiction out into the world with stunning regularity. Violence doesn’t always figure overtly in Bausch’s fiction, but the atmosphere never precludes it. Sometimes the violence is deeply buried and psychological, an underground river of anguish that threatens to flood the surface narrative. Or it’s the kind of violence that comes from above, like an act of God, a battering of one’s chances against the cosmic wheel.",
		"4" : "Bausch’s latest book is aptly titled. The 14 stories in “Living in the Weather of the World” inhabit places where the outlook for their characters is uncertain at best and cataclysmic at worst. Here love and marriage are brittle, people are driven by lust and desire they barely comprehend, and a lack of self-knowledge can ruin a man’s life just as surely as a loaded gun. Sometimes the action is galvanic, an explosive moment that puts the reader in mind of Flannery O’Connor’s ability to open out a story into dangerous, unknown territory. And, like O’Connor, Bausch is able to pull a story back from melodrama, no matter how sudden or dramatic the turn of events.",
		"5" : "In “Walking Distance,” an off-duty Memphis cop named Joseph Koren can’t believe his good fortune at having married, a little more than two years earlier, his lovely wife, Ella. He considers himself an aesthete, an admirer of beauty, whether in a woman or in the May colors of the street outside his picture window. The world is on display there, winking and shining back at him. Yet one morning, as he’s about to set out for his usual four-mile walk, a trivial domestic spat mushrooms unexpectedly. Suddenly the couple find themselves in the midst of a potential breakup and Joseph’s heading for the door. His service revolver, out of habit, is in his belt. “He strode away, like a kind of falling.”",
		"6" : "A less accomplished writer might have lost us right here. The action could feel spring-loaded, preordained, but what follows is a stunning and strange encounter with a self-described “bandit” who attempts to mug Joseph during his loop through the tree-lined neighborhood. In the shift of power and violence that takes place between the two men, there’s a kind of curbside confessional. “My wife told me this morning, man. She’s leaving me,” Joseph blurts out. “I thought we were happy. I’m falling over, you know? I’m sailing down. Plummeting. I can’t believe it.” The would-be mugger, who “wore a baseball cap with the FedEx logo on it, only the word was FEDUP,” says “Jesus.” Then, a beat later, “If I’d’ve known. I wouldn’t’ve bothered you, really.” When a story can bring us convincingly to this kind of reversal, we know we’re in the hands of a writer keenly attuned to the subtleties of human frailty and want.",
		"7" : "Bausch routinely takes us out to the end of the narrative pier and asks us to jump. Infidelity, as a literary theme, interests me less at face value than just about anything I can think of. But in three of these stories, Bausch uses it to excavate a surprising sense of drama and revelation.",
		"8" : "In “Sympathy,” we find a middle-aged woman named Faith enjoying “Bringing Up Baby” on her DVR one Saturday afternoon while her husband, Freddie, is out with his older brother at a horror movie matinee. The moment before the phone rings — changing her life and marriage irrevocably — there’s a flash of foreshadowing as she watches “Cary Grant chase after the little spotted dog while being pursued by the leopard.” Because we’re in a Richard Bausch story, we know the mention of a large carnivore isn’t accidental. Within a few pages, we’re at the emergency room and Faith’s teenage son has been picked up from his basketball game. Freddie has suffered a heart attack and Janice, a “chain-smoking nurse friend” who “loved gossip,” provides the details of his admittance. “They brought him in naked,” she says. “I thought he came from you.”",
		"9" : "This complicates matters in all the right ways, but Bausch is seldom content with the small detonations of marital life. He wants the implosion that immobilizes everything around it. And so “presently the entrance doorway slid open again, and a woman entered, carrying a clear plastic bag with clothes in it — you could see the shadow-shape of a shoe and the sleeve of a jacket.” “Freddie Hayes,” she says, arriving at the E.R. window. “I have his things.”",
		"10" : "As the two women encounter each other, we experience Faith’s emotions as a rush of memory and re-examination. In the sifting of marital flotsam, her life disperses into a haze: “The room was too bright. … She felt the light as a form of burning, and closed her eyes, and then opened them again.” This is a steppingstone to a moment of grace: “She turned to the girl, who really looked like nothing more than a girl, with her stringy hair and her thin white face and her fright, the brown eyes wide and quick, looking at Faith and then at the room. Faith touched the side of her face.”",
		"11" : "That Bausch can deliver such convincing humanity, no matter the initial angle of ascent, is a testament to his powers of technique and observation. Not all the stories in this collection are as vertiginous as the two I’ve mentioned here, but they’re all well crafted and energized. Moving among them, we find two half siblings rediscovering each other after decades; a talented young artist becoming beguiled (and betrayed) by the woman whose nude portrait he’s been commissioned to paint; an old couple grappling with choice amid a terminal illness; a drama-prone sister crashing her brother’s honeymoon; two 90-something World War II veterans, one German, one American, reuniting in the media spotlight. The world and the range of its emotional weather are on full display.",
		"12" : "In Bausch’s “Letter to a Young Writer,” Rule No. 6 simply reads: “Be willing.” “Be open for business all the time,” Bausch explains. “You must try to be that person on whom nothing is lost.” After nearly 40 years of his distinctive, sometimes electrifying fiction, it’s fair to say that Bausch has stayed open for business through all kinds of circumstances and conditions, that he’s been able to keep the lights on and burning bright."

		"1" : "THE OUTRUN By Amy Liptrot 280 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.",
		"2" : "Amy Liptrot begins her memoir with a glossary: In the Orkney Islands of far northern Scotland, seals are called selkies; cattle are kye; and the fog rolling in from the sea goes by the evocative haar. The place Liptrot uneasily calls home is an enchanted, windswept, salt-scoured archipelago where the northern lights are known as Merry Dancers and “lambing” is both a season and a verb.",
		"3" : "The term most central to Liptrot and this gorgeous debut, its guiding symbol and title, is “the outrun,” a stretch of uncultivated hillside land at “the furthest reaches of a farm, only semi-tamed, where domestic and wild animals coexist and humans don’t often visit so spirit people are free to roam.” It is in these wild pastures where Liptrot and her brother grew up with their bipolar father and very religious mother on their family sheep farm. Eager to leave at age 18, Liptrot spent the next decade in London, the antithesis of her bucolic home in the north, transforming herself into a party girl of the Hackney district, a place where “it felt like the perpetual last day of a festival.”",
		"4" : "It is exactly the excitement she sought when leaving Orkney, but inevitably the party ceases to be fun. As friends and confederates grow up and drink less, Liptrot sinks deeper into alcoholic isolation. She loses all the typical things: friends, boyfriends, apartments, jobs. Soon all decisions (or lack thereof) flow from one primary purpose: getting drunk. One night she is attacked after hitching a ride with a violent stranger, and narrowly escapes, a brush with trauma that a lesser writer would exploit for dramatic effect. Instead, Liptrot makes a realistic, anticlimactic but ultimately braver and more honest narrative decision to reveal her Turning Point as an emotional threshold — she just couldn’t take the pain of drinking any longer and enrolls herself in rehab.",
		"5" : "More than 10 years after fleeing, Liptrot returns to the Orkney Islands, chronicling the first two years of her sobriety in this recovery memoir closer in spirit to the work of the naturalist Rick Bass than the hard-drinking tales of Caroline Knapp or Augusten Burroughs. Full of lucid self-discovery and shimmering prose, “The Outrun” is more atmospheric than it is dramatic. “My life was rough and windy and tangled. Growing up in the wind leaves you strong, sloped and adept at seeking shelter.” Building drystone walls becomes a lesson in patience; delivering newborn lambs brings a sense of renewal. Metaphors lay things bare with a stunning simplicity as Liptrot searches for answers again and again in her island landscape, all sky and sea, where not even language has the ability to conceal.",
		"6" : "She does not flee to her parents, somewhat peacefully divorced now and still living on the main island of Orkney. There is a general restraint when writing about her family, vague specters swept away by the much more formative powers of the ocean and wind. What ultimately heals Liptrot and sustains this patiently wrought memoir are the rough and magical islands of Orkney. She gets a job surveying bird populations, eventually spending the winter on one of the smallest islands, Papay, population 70, where her gaze oscillates between her slow, incremental awakening to the sober world and the breathtaking ecology of her home.",
		"7" : "“The Outrun” becomes a kind of personal travelogue of the Orkney Islands, their numinous geology and mystical history, from the unique perspective of one who is both an outsider and a native. One imagines Liptrot writing these pages in the spectacular solitude she finds there, writing as much to stave off loneliness as to mine its many gifts, just as alcohol was once both the problem and the solution. It is a hard battle, and the push and pull, the urge to stay and to go, like the wind and the waves, never stops."

		"1" : "TELL ME HOW IT ENDS An Essay in Forty Questions By Valeria Luiselli 119 pp. Coffee House Press. Paper, $12.95.",
		"2" : "If there’s one anxiety common among writers, regardless of genre, it’s the work of bending an unruly mass of facts, events and memories into a coherent narrative — a story that a reader can pursue logically from beginning to end. Lives, real or imagined, rarely follow the clearly delineated start-stop borders that stories impose. Lorrie Moore, in the opening line of one of her most intricate short stories, noted this problem in the fewest possible words: “A beginning, an end: There seems to be neither.” Now the novelist and essayist Valeria Luiselli echoes it in the title and on the first page of her new book, “Tell Me How It Ends,” a work of narrative nonfiction born partially of her experience as a volunteer court translator for undocumented migrant children in New York. “The problem with trying to tell their story,” Luiselli writes, “is that it has no beginning, no middle and no end.”",
		"3" : "That indeterminate state may be inevitable given the complexity of these children’s lives. Luiselli suggests as much through a subtle and often personal interrogation of our immigration system, starting with the intake questionnaire given to migrant children once they are brought into custody. The 40 questions that make up the questionnaire turn difficult, harrowing lives into stories, ones with clearly marked borders that slip easily into the public imagination. Luiselli’s awareness of a story’s ability to restrict informs the book’s judicious use of these children’s lives, as well as its quietly brilliant structure as a series of responses to the questionnaire, which Luiselli describes as a reflection of “a colder, more cynical and brutal reality.”",
		"4" : "Filtered through the narrow lens of the court narrative, these stories of child migration have a single origin somewhere in Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala. They emerge against a backdrop of unavoidable gang-related violence that makes leaving the only viable option for survival. Once the decision to depart is made, the stories begin to migrate north in earnest, starting with la Bestia — the aptly nicknamed network of trains whose roofs and spines thousands of migrant children cling to in order to make it into Mexico alive, the penultimate step in a journey that in the best-case scenario concludes in a detention center on the United States side of the border.",
		"5" : "Luiselli reminds the reader that the general arc and the often brutal details of these children’s narratives have been reported before. The havoc wreaked across Central America by gangs like Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18; the brutal treatment of migrants by coyotes, police officers and cartels; the physical terror and exhaustion of riding on top of la Bestia — all of this dominated the news in 2014, when more than 68,000 children surrendered themselves at the border. We’ve known this story for years now, and if there is anything that Luiselli wants to dismantle, it’s our veneer of understanding.",
		"6" : "While driving through the Southwest border states with her husband and children, where they spot “fleeting herds of Border Patrol cars like ominous white stallions racing toward the horizon,” Luiselli wonders how the militant anti-immigration protesters maintain such fierce hostility in the face of these children’s suffering. The answer, she notes, lies partially in our language of immigration; we see legal and illegal residents, aliens instead of children. In her responses to the questionnaire, Luiselli takes the opposite approach. She expands and connects the fates of these children to the United States military’s involvement in Central America in the 1980s, and to United States immigration policies in the 1990s. It’s a far richer story in her hands, and it expands out of necessity to include America’s evolving relationship with Mexico, and Mexico’s evolving relationship with its neighboring countries. The account that emerges has no fixed origin, and the crisis, as Luiselli wisely points out, belongs not to any specific country or countries but to all of us living in this corner of the world.",
		"7" : "Happily, Luiselli does not write with the journalist’s attempt at objectivity. This is an intimate narrative, but it’s not a memoir. The portrait of migration she offers is intended to complicate, rather than resolve or clarify. As a result, it’s hard not to want more information, more scrutiny and engagement with the connecting strands of history woven into the narrative, particularly with the legacy of the Reagan-era politics that shaped United States immigration policy, and by extension, our foreign policy priorities in Central America.",
		"8" : "That said, Luiselli wisely invests most of the book’s energy establishing the moral and emotional foundation of her approach to the work she does as a volunteer, and as an author. That foundation is built early on, in the pages devoted to the family road trip that begins after she and her husband have applied for green cards. Luiselli, who like her husband was born in Mexico, relates her encounters with border police and activists. She recalls the Southwest’s blood-soaked history, when it was still Mexico. She also notes, as they drive past ghost towns into the mass-migrant graveyard of the Arizona desert, that this journey across the United States has been a family expedition, and that means the two kids sitting in the back seat are, as she reminds us over and over, “our children.”"

		"1" : "UNDERGROUND FUGUE By Margot Singer 290 pp. Melville House. $25.99.",
		"2" : "Margot Singer’s first novel is set in London during the summer of the deadly terrorist bombings of 2005, but it’s less a panoramic portrait of a city under siege than a study of four troubled characters. Running away from a failing marriage and the traumatic memories of her teenage son’s accidental death, Esther has come to London from New York to nurse her dying mother during her final days. Slipping in and out of morphine-induced dreams in which she relives her desperate escape from Central Europe in 1939 — “Another story floats upward toward the light” — Lonia lies in her sickbed in her North London home.",
		"3" : "Next door are new neighbors: Dr. Javad Asghari, a research neuroscientist, originally from Iran but a resident of Britain for the past 25 years, and his 19-year-old son, Amir, an undergraduate studying Middle Eastern history and politics at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies.",
		"4" : "From Charles Dickens to Peter Ackroyd, novelists have written about London as a place where people from all walks of life find themselves connected to one another — “a web so taut and tightly drawn that the slightest movement of any part sent reverberations through the whole,” as a character in Ackroyd’s novel “Three Brothers” describes “Bleak House.” Singer’s London, by comparison, is one of missed connections, miscommunications and misinterpretations. “It was a mystery how two people ever came together. Life flung you out like an elemental particle colliding and dividing, spinning into space,” Javad muses, standing on the busy Euston Road as “cars and people stream past like synapses across basal ganglia, like a time-lapse photograph of lights.”",
		"5" : "Singer’s characters experience a city in which “the boundaries seemed fixed. You could assimilate — perfect your accent, make a fortune, change your name — but the real England remained as inaccessible as the city’s private clubs and gardens, locked away behind wrought iron gates.”",
		"6" : "As such, barring the most obvious of associations — shared blood or postal codes — the lives of her four central characters aren’t so much intertwined as running in parallel. This isn’t to say there’s no delight to be found in these often perceptive and delicately drawn portraits — in particular those of Esther, whose “moorings have been cut free,” and Javad, haunted by the “nostalgia of an exile he’s condemned to bear” — but their interactions are decidedly less convincing. That Esther suspects Javad’s son of involvement with the bombings is a story line with potential, but Singer neglects to prepare for it with sufficiently convincing groundwork. Nor does she adequately follow through on the implications of this accusation, merely flirting with the very real and dangerous climate of fear that infected the city in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.",
		"7" : "Of course, London has a long history of politically motivated violence: from Guy Fawkes’s plot through the “Greenwich Bomb Outrage” in 1894 (which partly inspired Joseph Conrad’s novel “The Secret Agent”) to the I.R.A. bombing campaign that set the capital on alert for decades. Thus, to depict what has come to be known as the 7/7 bombings as a self-contained occurrence seems like a further lost opportunity. Although Singer, who is the author of a well-regarded story collection, “The Pale of Settlement,” successfully demonstrates depth and richness in the initial construction of the psychologies of each of her characters, these qualities are missing when it comes to both the broader backdrop of the action and, more important, the novel’s narrative cohesion. At the close, there’s a fugue-like absence where there should be congruence and meaning."

		"1" : "WAIT TILL YOU SEE ME DANCE Stories By Deb Olin Unferth 190 pp. Graywolf Press. Paper, $16.",
		"2" : "A teacher proposes a game to her adult-education students: “Let’s each tell the story of the worst thing that’s happened to us.” So popular is this activity that it becomes a regular part of the class, until one night a student tells a story so astounding that the tradition ends with his tale. (It features a rectal thermometer.)",
		"3" : "This is the plot of “Voltaire Night,” which appears in Deb Olin Unferth’s fourth book and second story collection, “Wait Till You See Me Dance.” Many of its 39 offbeat entries, which alternate between longer tour de force tales and flash fiction, could serve as contenders in a so-called Voltaire night. They’re populated by jilted lovers and spurned mothers; moody armed teenagers; desperate working stiffs; irritable babies; even a woman who is “becoming a thoroughly unlikable person” — in short, people on the brink of emotional, physical, psychological and/or financial ruin.",
		"4" : "This assemblage of down-and-out moments is delivered with a wit and concision reminiscent of Lydia Davis and Diane Williams, a wry intelligence and keen irony that don’t prevent Unferth’s prose from offering deep emotional intimacy. Sharply exposing her characters’ shortcomings, she’s just as meticulous in revealing their suffering. We may laugh at them, but ultimately we ache along with them.",
		"5" : "The struggle to be good is central to many of these stories, never mind that the characters’ good intentions are often misdirected or self-serving. When the cynical teacher of an English class for “last-chance” students becomes a secret advocate for its weakest member, she admits that her valiant efforts on his behalf aren’t untarnished by selfishness: “It may seem like I was being heroic here, trying to save this kid, but the truth is I was just grateful to be feeling something.” This toggling between bitterness and tenderness is a dynamic force in Unferth’s work.",
		"6" : "In a musing typical of Unferth’s protagonists, the recovering alcoholic mother in “Pet” — while contemplating a bathroom covered in the waste of the turtles upon which she has been showering the attention her teenage son refuses — observes that she possesses “the opposite of insight” and is “doomed to middling livelihood at best, certain solitude, early illness, weakness, not-quite poverty, strained relations with her son, relatives who don’t really like her taking care of her when she is old.” Then she notices the turtle droppings in her hair. Situating such characters at the brink, Unferth tinges even trivial moments of anxiety with a sense of existential crisis.",
		"7" : "Yet the darker the book tilts, the more hilarious it becomes. The woman who perceives her increasing unlikability “fixed herself on being likable for the next four seconds (more than that was impossible).” Unferth frequently uses parentheticals like this to transform neutral statements into knives, to bestow the bite of irony on a cliché: “She and her mother would have the time of their lives (well, not exactly, but it would have its moments).”",
		"8" : "Unferth’s book is rich with surprises, small and large. She is equally adept at deadpan realism and postmodern playfulness, deploying stories that take the form of lists, plot summaries and dirty jokes. Her miniature stories are often wickedly insightful. In the absurd yet close-to-home parable “Online,” a woman decides to reduce her internet time from 24 hours a day to two, but “she can’t remember what there is to do in the world other than study screens of various sizes with various intentions.”",
		"9" : "In Unferth’s most stunning orchestration, “The First Full Thought of Her Life,” the narrative dives into many different points of view as it evokes the moment when a shooter trains his gun on a child climbing a sand dune. This impossibly disturbing subject matter is served well by — perhaps even demands — the innovative and capacious structure Unferth has given it. In the critical climactic instant, we find ourselves transported to a descending airplane below which “the glinting waves were like spilled jewels or glowing undersea algae or floating space junk.” The presence of optimism in the face of likely doom creates cognitive dissonance in this story and many others, leaving Unferth’s readers on uncertain footing: Are we supposed to be hopeful, or are we supposed to sink further into despair?",
		"10" : "A central concern running throughout the collection is anxiety about the act of storytelling itself. Reading about writers writing about writing can be a wearying proposition, but in Unferth’s hands this endeavor feels expansive rather than myopic, thanks to her perceptive humor and her fierce way of tussling with her thoughts. Her disillusionment with the act of writing runs neck and neck with her belief in the act of writing. Telling stories, sharing the darkest things inside and outside oneself, may, she suggests, be the only possible path to some sort of relief. Yet this is countered by an element of scorn directed at herself, as a writer, for presuming anything about her vocation.",
		"11" : "These stories-that-doubt-the-worthiness-of-stories culminate in the one-paragraph piece “Draft,” in which a writer discovers that the scraps of her work in progress are “more racket than song, more stones than statue, more rags than rug.” Yet even as she despairs over these fragments, she delivers her lament with exquisite precision and rhythm. Again and again in these pages, Unferth swerves from the mundane to the extraordinary, from biting to soaringly celebratory, often in a single sentence. If these are her scraps, I’ll take them — the racket, the stones, the rags."

		"3" : "Mr. Lutz, 31, worked at Radian’s headquarters in Philadelphia verifying that the company’s internal accounting controls were effective. This task is also known as Sarbanes-Oxley testing, named for the Enron-era legislation that bolstered the penalties for accounting fraud.",
		"4" : "Radian was required to set aside reserves against potential losses on bad loans, and Mr. Lutz reckoned that his employer was materially understating those amounts. The company was looking to raise capital through a stock offering, and the lower the reserves, the better the company’s earnings would appear.",
		"5" : "When Mr. Lutz voiced his concerns to his superiors, he said he was told to stand down.",
		"6" : "“I felt like I was on an island,” Mr. Lutz told me in a phone interview. “This big-insurance-company-versus-this-little-guy is a very lonely and difficult situation to be in. But I felt I had no other choice. I was doing my job and doing what was right.”",
		"7" : "After an investigation of Mr. Lutz’s allegations, Radian concluded that he was wrong: Its reserves had been appropriate.",
		"8" : "But, for the whistle-blower, the damage was done. Indeed, Mr. Lutz said that before he made an issue of the company’s reserves, he had been thriving at Radian. “I wasn’t some bad egg,” he said. “All my performance reviews exceeded expectations.” About a year earlier, Mr. Lutz said he had received a company award for stellar performance.",
		"9" : "When he got nowhere on the reserves issue, Mr. Lutz recalled, he emailed Radian’s internal compliance hotline. He knew he was taking a chance: Those complaints went to an executive who was a high-ranking member of the group that decided the company’s reserve amounts.",
		"10" : "Soon, he said, he was disinvited from meetings. After Radian investigated his allegations, the company outsourced Mr. Lutz’s job and those of others in his group. Then Radian gave him a choice: He could take a new position auditing the company’s information technology systems, or he could resign and receive approximately $75,000 in severance.",
		"11" : "That sounded fine, until he scrutinized the deal. To receive the money from Radian, he had to sign a document stating that he had not filed a complaint against the company with any local, state or federal agencies. Another stipulation: Accepting the severance would bar him from receiving any “monetary damages or any other form of personal relief” in connection with an investigation or proceeding involving the company.",
		"12" : "In other words, he could not receive a whistle-blower award.",
		"13" : "Because Mr. Lutz and some colleagues had reported their concerns about Radian to the S.E.C., he did not sign the severance agreement. So he accepted the new position the company had offered. He soon found himself essentially reporting to a low-level employee at an outside vendor. When he asked to go back to financial auditing at Radian, a superior told him that he’d never be allowed to conduct those tasks.",
		"14" : "He decided to leave Radian. Luckily, he found employment elsewhere in the field.",
		"15" : "Still, Mr. Lutz wonders why the S.E.C. has not pursued the whistle-blower complaint he filed against Radian, which outlined its retaliation against him. “A big reason why people don’t report these things is what happened to me in this instance,” Mr. Lutz said. “That’s a big deterrent to people. Every time issues like mine are not enforced, it reinforces the notion that these pieces of legislation are paper tigers and nothing is going to come of it anyway.”",
		"16" : "It’s not as if the facts of the retaliation are in doubt. Last fall, the Labor Department sided with Mr. Lutz in an identical matter he had filed against Radian with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. After examining the material produced by Mr. Lutz and Radian, the Labor Department agreed that the company had punished him for speaking up; it required Radian to pay him $20,000 in damages.",
		"17" : "Then there is the matter of the restrictive severance agreement Radian offered. Its terms are similar to those that have drawn fire from the S.E.C. at other companies recently.",
		"18" : "In January, for example, BlackRock, the huge asset manager, settled with the S.E.C. for offering exit agreements that prevented former employees from reaping the financial benefits of whistle-blowing. Without admitting or denying the findings, BlackRock paid $340,000 to settle the matter.",
		"19" : "The agreement Radian offered to Mr. Lutz was equally problematic, said Stuart Meissner, a lawyer in New York City who represents him. “He didn’t get severance solely because he participated in the S.E.C.’s whistle-blower program,” Mr. Meissner said. “This needs to be addressed.”",
		"20" : "The S.E.C. does not confirm or deny the existence of a whistle-blower case or investigation, but I asked Radian about Mr. Lutz’s complaints against the company. It contested much of his account.",
		"21" : "Through an outside spokesman, Steve Murray, Radian said it took Mr. Lutz’s concerns very seriously.",
		"22" : "“Radian immediately informed the Audit Committee of its board of directors, and within days engaged a highly respected law firm and ‘Big Four’ accounting firm to perform an independent investigation of the matter,” the company said in a statement. That investigation “ultimately concluded what time has borne out, that there were no instances of fraudulent conduct or a material misstatement of Radian’s reserve position.”",
		"23" : "Radian also rejects Mr. Lutz’s retaliation claim, saying that it gave him a raise after he voiced his concerns. The company reassigned him, Mr. Murray said, after its audit committee approved a proposal to outsource its Sarbanes-Oxley testing. Interestingly, it gave that business to KPMG, the same auditing firm it had hired to help conduct its investigation into the reserves matter.",
		"24" : "The company also said it disagreed with the Labor Department’s findings but had decided against an appeal.",
		"25" : "And what about that restrictive severance agreement?",
		"26" : "Mr. Murray, the Radian spokesman, said it had recently changed its policy on such agreements and had removed the restriction on monetary recoveries it had required of Mr. Lutz.",
		"27" : "The agreement offered to Mr. Lutz was “prepared with the assistance of outside counsel and contained terms and conditions that were customary at that time,” Radian said. The company continues to believe the agreement complied with laws and regulations.",
		"28" : "Corporate employees who speak truth to power about internal operations are already putting themselves in harm’s way. When the S.E.C. doesn’t act on a whistle-blower’s claim that others have found valid, it raises questions about its program.",
		"29" : "“I don’t understand how one independent third party — the Labor Department — can conclude that there was retaliation,” Mr. Lutz said, “and another one just ignores it.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "This interview with Mike O’Neill, chief executive of BMI, a music-rights management company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.",
		"2" : "Q. What were your early years like?",
		"3" : "A. I grew up in Oceanport, N.J. It’s the same town I live in now. I have three brothers and a sister. We all live there still, except for my younger brother, who moved 20 minutes south. He was a little bit of a rebel.",
		"4" : "Being the middle child allowed me some freedom, because I was building bridges between the younger two and the older two. I got to play in that vacuum a little bit, which allowed me to be somewhat independent and creative.",
		"5" : "If I needed attention, I had to work to get it, whether it was through athletics, doing well in school or having conversations with my parents about the events of the day.",
		"6" : "My parents had a few rules that allowed us to be independent as kids. We had to watch each other’s backs and trust each other, and we also had to respect everybody else and be accountable. They gave us a lot of room. They were the opposite of helicopter parents.",
		"7" : "What were you doing outside of class?",
		"8" : "I was captain of the basketball team. We grew up a mile from the ocean, so for many summers, until I graduated from college, I was a lifeguard. I also bartended at night. With those jobs, you always had to be aware of your surroundings and to stop anything bad from happening. It’s hard work to have that sustained focus.",
		"9" : "What are some key leadership lessons you’ve learned?",
		"10" : "You can’t treat everybody the same. People are different. You can have a tendency to think everyone’s going to receive information or react to it like you would, and they’re not. That was a key insight for me.",
		"11" : "There was also a learning curve around the idea that I might get information at a point in time and start acting on that. But there’s a whole group of people who don’t have that information, so you have to distill it for them, and get them on the same page in order to move forward.",
		"12" : "What are some specifics about your culture?",
		"13" : "One of my favorite things when we go into a staff meeting is to say: “Anybody waiting on a call? Is there an emergency? If not, turn your phones off. We’re here for 35 minutes to an hour, whichever it may be. We can focus for that. If you have something that’s time sensitive, you can step out of the room and do it, but just let us know beforehand.”",
		"14" : "Have you always done that?",
		"15" : "Always. It’s like sitting on that lifeguard stand. You could focus for an hour. The internet is very intrusive in that way. I used to sit in meetings and see people on their phones and wonder, “Why are you here?”",
		"16" : "Any other pet peeves?",
		"17" : "Entitlement. Sometimes people have a title and they assume authority. That bothers me. You have to earn that title every day. You have to do more than everybody else to keep that title, and not to be seen as living off somebody else’s work.",
		"18" : "How do you hire?",
		"19" : "When I interview people, I want to know if they have those same qualities that my parents expected from us: trust, respect, accountability and watching others’ backs. And I learn more by asking them about the people they surround themselves with than I do by asking them direct questions.",
		"20" : "So I’ll ask about their last job. Who was the person you really wanted to work for? Who was the person you wanted to run from? Why? What were the traits of those people?",
		"21" : "And when I interview people, I usually do one in the office and then I try to do one outside the office, and I make the person pick the restaurant.",
		"22" : "Because?",
		"23" : "I want to see if they’re trying to impress me, or if they make me go to them or they come to me. What do they order? What are they thinking? Are they trying to please the C.E.O.? One of my first questions when I sit down is: “This is a great place. Why did you pick it?” Some people will say, “I was nervous when you asked me to pick it.” I love that answer because they’re being very candid with me at that point.",
		"24" : "If you only had five minutes to interview someone, what would you ask them?",
		"25" : "Tell me about the current environment you’re in or the current position you hold. What don’t you like about the culture of the place or the person you’re working with? Why are you looking to leave?",
		"26" : "I love those questions, because they allow you to see whether the person is leaving for money, or because of the culture, or for a new opportunity. What are they looking for in their lives that they’re not getting in their current environment?",
		"27" : "And do I have something that I could offer them that might fit that role? It will allow me to see that immediately.",
		"28" : "There are right and wrong flavors of answers. And they might have the absolute correct answer, but I might not have the solution for them. So I know even if I offer them a job, it’s not going to satisfy what they need.",
		"29" : "Advice for new college grads?",
		"30" : "The first would be to treat everybody with respect. The second thing is that it’s not a race. I didn’t become chief executive when I graduated college. It took me a long time, and part of that journey is fun. You’ve got to enjoy the ride.",
		"31" : "So don’t be so aggressive. You can be assertive, but if you’re overly aggressive, you’re going to ruin your opportunities. Sometimes you have to let the organization pull you.",
		"32" : "Some of the best jobs were given to me that I didn’t even realize were coming. Some of the worst jobs I’ve had were when I pushed for them, and I discovered that I wasn’t ready for the job."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Blinking lights, the clicking sound of coins, and perks like free or inexpensive food, drinks and casino bus trips are enticing many older women to gamble.",
		"2" : "For some people, that seductive environment can be extremely dangerous.",
		"3" : "“Casinos are trained to make you feel welcome, while you lose your life,” said Sandra Adell, 70, a literature professor in the Department of Afro-American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who recounted her experiences as a compulsive gambler in the book “Confessions of a Slot Machine Queen.” In an interview, Professor Adell said that advertisements aimed at older adults often show smiling people, dressed up and looking glamorous, “to create an illusion that plays to people’s weaknesses.”",
		"4" : "“What the industry is doing,” she continued, “the way it markets and keeps casinos filled with elderly people, is morally reprehensible.”",
		"5" : "Hard numbers are difficult to find, but Keith Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, said that gambling addiction among older women near or in retirement appears to be increasing in scope and severity, with a devastating impact on personal finances.",
		"6" : "Marilyn Lancelot, 86, of Sun City, Ariz., for example, said that after being a compulsive gambler for seven years, she was arrested at age 61 for embezzling $350,000 from her job and served nearly a year in prison. “I really thought I’d win the big one deep down in my heart,” she said in an interview. “Every gambler says that.” Ms. Lancelot has described her experiences in the book “Gripped by Gambling.”",
		"7" : "Many experts say that men are often “action” gamblers, who favor blackjack and poker, while women tend to be “escape” gamblers, drawn to games based on luck, like slot machines and lottery tickets. Women often begin gambling later in life than men, sometimes after a major life event, like the death of a spouse or when they become empty nesters.",
		"8" : "Women are less likely to develop gambling problems than men, Mr. Whyte said, but “telescoping, the rapid development of problems, is especially pronounced in senior women.” It may seem surprising to some people that women have severe gambling problems, he said. “Grandma is not seen as someone who embezzles money and is taken off to jail,” he said, yet it happens.",
		"9" : "Many women lose significant amounts of money and jeopardize their futures. “Once they tap into retirement savings, it’s incredibly hard — if they are ever able — to rebuild those savings,” Mr. Whyte said.",
		"10" : "Stephanie Iacopino, 63, of Toms River, N.J., who works part time in retail sales, said that during years of compulsive gambling, she stole money from family members, friends and clients in a travel business, and ultimately went to prison in 2010 for embezzling about $18,000 from her church. She said she served nearly four months at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women near Clinton, N.J., followed by 22 months in New Jersey’s Intensive Supervision Program, which, the state says, is “more onerous” than traditional probation. “We don’t have a nest egg,” said Ms. Iacopino, who is married. “We live paycheck to paycheck.” But she said that while she is struggling financially, she is happy to be recovering from her addiction.",
		"11" : "Some women have medical issues associated with gambling, Mr. Whyte said, like bladder problems aggravated by not getting up from slot machines to go to the bathroom. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that among older people, some medications may lead to compulsive behavior, including gambling addiction. Decreased cognitive functioning can also interfere with the ability to make sound decisions, he added.",
		"12" : "There is a strong connection between gambling and substance abuse. “If you are a problem gambler, you are four times more likely to have a problem with alcohol at some point in your life,” he said. “At a minimum, the rate of problem gambling among people with substance-use disorders is four to five times that found in the general population.” (The council operates a national 24/7 help line for problem gamblers and their families.)",
		"13" : "Patricia A. Healy, clinical director of Healy Counseling Associates, in Toms River, N.J., which specializes in addiction counseling, said problem gambling among the elderly “is a hot issue and undernoticed in this country.”",
		"14" : "“Gambling is the stepchild of the addiction world,” she said. “You can’t smell it, you can’t see it, you can’t observe it,” unless you see someone in action.",
		"15" : "For certain people, she said, there is an adrenaline rush and “suddenly they’re in the chase. Sadly for some, it’s a death spiral.” Bus trips to casinos are sometimes arranged to coincide with the arrival of pension and Social Security checks, she said, and cases of retirees who cash in their I.R.A.s and pensions, or mortgage or ultimately lose their houses are not uncommon. “There is a tremendous amount of shame.”",
		"16" : "Neva Pryor, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said some older people gamble with money intended for medication and find themselves in desperate straits. Some who become suicidal may “drive out in traffic and get killed so families can collect insurance,” she said.",
		"17" : "Sam Skolnik, author of “High Stakes: The Rising Cost of America’s Gambling Addiction,” said the aftereffects of pathological gambling include social costs that range from loss of productivity at work, domestic crime, suicide and harm to families from rising indebtedness, home foreclosure and bankruptcy. “When the elderly gamble, they are often harmed in a more permanent way, sadly,” he said. “There’s no question the industry knows that they lose more money than they should.”",
		"18" : "Sara Slane, senior vice president for public affairs at the American Gaming Association, which represents casinos, said in an email statement, “While problem gambling has not increased along with the increase in casinos, the industry and the A.G.A. continue to increase their investment and commitment to responsible gaming programs.” She cited research in The Journal of Gambling Studies that compared telephone surveys conducted in 1999 and 2000 with those from 2011 to 2013, and found that rates of problem gambling remained stable over all and actually declined among women.",
		"19" : "Rachel Volberg, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences, who studies gambling, said the state of knowledge about the issue in the United States is still inadequate. “There’s not much support for gambling research in the U.S.,” she said.",
		"20" : "It wasn’t until 1980 that pathological gambling was designated as a mental health issue in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, she said: “It’s a relatively young disorder as far as having recognition.”",
		"21" : "Ms. Lancelot, of Arizona, who is now retired, said she left prison with nothing but eventually recovered financially. As a felon, getting a job and an apartment was difficult, but she borrowed three months’ rent from her brother, offered to pay the landlord in advance and found work as a secretary with the Arizona state government. Within 10 years, she said, she had two homes, a new car and checking accounts. “I want older people to know that it’s not the end of the world,” she said.",
		"22" : "Ms. Pryor, of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said older adults can protect themselves from potential gambling problems in retirement by seeking help in managing their finances — and in planning how to spend their time — long before they stop working. “What people need to realize,” she said, “is, they may win a little, but ultimately, the house always wins.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "I have worked for my employer for 10 years under multiple supervisors, who always have offices at a different location and whom I rarely see face to face. On two occasions, I have been expected to chip in for a present for a supervisor. The first time was for a former supervisor’s farewell present. When I declined to contribute, I received an email from my current supervisor saying my decision made her “sad.” The second time involved colleagues asking me to chip in for a present for my current supervisor after she’d had minor surgery. Again I declined. I do not mind chipping in for presents for colleagues, but feel that the pressure to pay for a gift for a supervisor is inappropriate. What is your take? A.M., NEW YORK",
		"2" : "This is a good example of why workplace fund-raising plans — to buy a present, pay for a party, etc. — ought to be handled more thoughtfully than they usually are. Even when a gift will be presented as coming from everyone, a better method for actually collecting the cash is to stick with a system that’s both voluntary and anonymous: passing around a manila envelope, for instance, and asking for some suggested (but not compulsory or minimum) amount. Otherwise, it’s almost guaranteed that some will feel pressured, or even bullied, into contributing more than they want to.",
		"3" : "Would making it easier to opt out mean that less money gets raised? Probably. But a company isn’t founded and organized for the purpose of exchanging thoughtful and heartfelt presents. Such gestures are certainly nice, and can contribute to a pleasant work environment. But if you have to choose between a more modest gift and the risk of disgruntled or resentful colleagues, settle for the smaller present. (Or, if an organization concludes that goodbye presents and the like are vital to its culture, simply budget for them.)",
		"4" : "Of course, this does not describe your situation. I think you are well within your rights to decline to contribute, but there is a decent chance you will pay what amounts to a social cost for doing so: Your manager and other colleagues may, even unconsciously, suspect that on some level you’re not really a team player. I don’t think that’s fair, but it can occur anyway.",
		"5" : "It may help to explain your decision. Your personal rule about when such donations are appropriate certainly strikes me as reasonable. Explaining that you are on a tight budget to meet a personal savings goal, or some such, may do the trick. The point is to depersonalize the matter: It’s not about your feelings toward or judgment of the person receiving the gift, it’s a side effect of a strict personal policy. You might even suggest that the company revisit the way it handles such matters, to avoid precisely this sort of needless conflict between personal choices and office mores.",
		"6" : "While applying for a position I ultimately accepted, I was interviewed by someone who was friendly with one of my colleagues at the company I was trying to leave. He acknowledged this during the interview. Naturally, I asked him to keep our meeting confidential, since I did not want it to be public knowledge that I was looking around. He assured me he would do so.",
		"7" : "I recently started at the new company, and I have learned that my interviewer — before my accepting the offer — not only informed his friend (my colleague at the time) that I was looking to leave, but also asked questions about me. While I respect the due diligence on a potential hire, he violated my confidence and lied to me. Am I naïve to trust this person in any capacity going forward? ANONYMOUS",
		"8" : "I’m assuming that when you say he agreed to keep the interview confidential, you provided some relevant reference to speak to instead; it seems surprising that a potential employer would flat-out agree not to talk to anybody with knowledge of your work situation at the time.",
		"9" : "Still, by your account, it’s no surprise that you would remain suspicious of this person. Given this and some of the details of your story, it might be wise to clear the air.",
		"10" : "That doesn’t mean a “you lied!” confrontation. It’s not clear how you learned about his having exactly the conversation he told you he wouldn’t have, but in approaching this, you should leave open the possibility of a miscommunication somewhere. Something like: “I gather that after our interview, you spoke to X. If so, I guess he must have said good things, and I’m happy it all worked out and I got this job. But I’m curious if you did, because I thought we’d agreed you wouldn’t talk to him, since it wasn’t common knowledge that I was considering another job.”",
		"11" : "One thing you’re looking for here is the possibility that your source doesn’t have the facts straight. Also: Maybe the interviewer remembers your conversation differently, or there’s more to the story that you don’t know. But what you’re really looking for is his attitude about the matter. If it’s frank and conciliatory, maybe you can trust that this was a one-off incident. If it’s indifferent or dismissive, he’s probably someone to be wary of.",
		"12" : "A final factor to consider is how much you’re likely to be interacting with this individual. If he’s someone you can easily steer clear of, then maybe that’s the simpler path. But if you’ll need to deal with him regularly, then some kind of conversation seems like a better bet than a permanent air of suspicion."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "“Honey, doesn’t this look just like a Gray Malin photograph?”",
		"2" : "The photographer Gray Malin says he heard an American woman loudly exclaim this to her husband last summer at La Fontelina, a sun-dappled, umbrella-studded beach club in Capri, Italy.",
		"3" : "Mr. Malin, 31, was understandably thrilled and introduced himself. “They were on their honeymoon, we took a photo and it was so cute,” he said. “But really, I was just as surprised as she was.”",
		"4" : "Then, using a Canon camera, he went back to shooting La Fontelina, the type of place where everyone looks as if they just stepped off a yacht. It is a staple of “La Dolce Vita,” his continuing series chronicling the glamour of the Italian Riviera.",
		"5" : "For eight years, Mr. Malin has been churning out pieces that don’t require a background in art to appreciate: balloon-covered llamas on the Bolivian salt flats, brightly hued life preservers floating on top of a pool, balloon letters above a beach that spell “I am busy.” Along with framed prints (priced as high as $18,000), there are Gray Malin water bottles, luggage tags, iPhone covers, sneakers, hotel key cards, beach towels, drink trays and candle holders. There are collaborations with Neiman Marcus and shoots for which brands like Veuve Cliquot and Le Meridien pick up the tab.",
		"6" : "Mr. Malin’s rise dovetailed with that of Instagram, where he has more than 231,000 followers, and the platform exposed his work to celebrity fans including Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon. “His beautifully composed aerial images caught my eye,” Ms. Witherspoon wrote in an email. “I love the feeling they evoke of beautiful days in the sun and living a colorful life.”",
		"7" : "Like an Amazon algorithm, Mr. Malin has figured out, through every step of his photography career, what his audience liked and then altered his output accordingly.",
		"8" : "In 2009, he was selling prints for $65 apiece at flea markets around Los Angeles. “I met and networked and learned what people were looking for in their homes, and if something did resonate, I thought, ‘How can I further develop this work into other work that people will want to hang?’” he said, sitting at an enormous computer monitor in the conference room of his company’s headquarters in West Hollywood, Calif. Outside, a dozen young staff members tapped diligently in front of similarly oversize screens.",
		"9" : "“Every photograph I started to take went from photography to fine-art photography to photographs that are meant to look great inside your home,” Mr. Malin said. “It was like social media before social media.”",
		"10" : "He is intimately acquainted with such a concept: His mother, Amy Muzzy Malin, edited the interior design sections of Glamour and Mademoiselle magazines before the family moved from New York to Dallas (his father is a real estate developer). In Dallas, Ms. Malin oversaw photo shoots and scouted locations for other magazines, and often brought Gray along.",
		"11" : "“I’d do my homework in the corner while they were shooting interiors,” he said. “It’s something I was very aware of, at a young age, how a room looked.”",
		"12" : "At 16, he took a high school photography class, spending nights and weekends in the darkroom and studying the clean lines of the Hungarian photographer Andre Kertesz. At Emerson College, Mr. Malin studied photography and marketing, to appease his parents.",
		"13" : "After school, he moved to Los Angeles to work in the promotions department of Paramount Studios but quit after a year. He got an internship with David LaChapelle and spent a week watching him shoot a Dos Equis ad. Then he interned with Jill Greenberg, the photographer known for her plasticized-looking portraits of celebrities including Simon Cowell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gwen Stefani.",
		"14" : "“I realized I didn’t want to do commercial work or portraiture,” Mr. Malin said. “I really wanted to do fine art, which sounds so 21-year-old-y.” He enrolled in continuing-education classes and took odd jobs like assisting on a wedding. “I shot some family in Manhattan Beach’s Christmas card,” he said. “They all wore white shirts and jeans.”",
		"15" : "After a teacher asked him to do a humorous photo series, Mr. Malin visited Marfa, the art hub in West Texas that his parents had frequented since he was 13. On a lark, he threw a banana peel on the highway in front of the Prada Marfa installation and took a picture of it. His teacher and classmates loved the shot.",
		"16" : "Six months later, in September 2010, he returned to Marfa to do a more organized shoot around the Prada store. His lanky cousin served as a model, his father’s buddy brought a mule, and a friend from Paramount brokered a deal for secondhand Prada shopping bags after Mr. Malin’s eBay searches came up empty. “It’s hysterical how hard it is to get shopping bags,” he said.",
		"17" : "Mr. Malin had started on the flea-market circuit in 2009, and when he introduced the Marfa photos, they flew out of his booth. Around the same time, the home goods site One Kings Lane was picking up steam, and Mr. Malin emailed the company to see if it would be interested in selling his work.",
		"18" : "“I hadn’t really seen anything like it,” said Susan Feldman, a founder of One Kings Lane.",
		"19" : "The site would put up limited quantities of Mr. Malin’s prints and they would routinely sell out; he would invite friends over to watch movies while they slapped labels on boxes. “It was just what I was hoping — I was seeding myself into these somewhat affluent homes all over the country,” Mr. Malin said.",
		"20" : "He eventually embarked on more ambitious projects: shooting beach scenes from helicopters over Miami and Kauai, Hawaii, and joining a National Geographic expedition to Antarctica, where he juxtaposed a beach ball with hulking glaciers.",
		"21" : "At Art Basel Miami Beach, he met the Bolivian photographer Gaston Ugalde (the “Andean Warhol,” according to some critics). Mr. Malin mentioned wanting to stage a shoot on Salar de Uyuni, the world’s largest salt flat, in southwest Bolivia; Mr. Ugalde offered to take him there. “He surprised me, actually,” Mr. Ugalde said. “The first impressions I had of him are very, not fragile, but a very delicate person. It’s surprising to me that he was so great and he had balance and he wasn’t afraid of making the trip on his own to the salt flats.”",
		"22" : "But what about the great salt flat of the internet where much art is now promoted and sold? After creating an e-commerce site in 2013, Mr. Malin sought out “on brand” social media influencers, like the model Rocky Barnes, who might be open to hanging a print in their homes and sharing a photo of it on their own feeds.",
		"23" : "“Now,” Mr. Malin said, “they really want to get paid.”",
		"24" : "Mr. Malin himself is a low-key presence, spending summers on Lake Michigan with his husband, Jeff Richardson, a former business analyst for Mattel and Disney who became the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Gray Malin last year and oversees pesky things like shipping and logistics.",
		"25" : "Mr. Malin wears polo shirts and sweaters around his neck and chooses not to dye gray streaks in his close-cropped hair. At a Vanity Fair party before the Oscars, while sequined starlets swirled around, he gushed that the most exciting week of his life was when Jenna Bush filmed a “Today” show segment on him and Maria Shriver came over to look at prints. “In one week, there was a Kennedy and a Bush in my house,” he said.",
		"26" : "As for the current administration, “the day after the election, my dad called me and said, ‘Are you kind of excited about this, for your brand?’” Mr. Malin said. “I was like, ‘Are you kidding? I’m devastated!’”",
		"27" : "“‘But think about it, you bring this escape to everyone,” he remembers his father telling him. “‘And now more than ever, people are going to need the escape.’”",
		"28" : "Indeed, Mr. Malin’s professional Instagram profile says that he is “on a mission to make every day a getaway.” In the aquamarine-hue feed of photos that follows, there is no indication of political tensions or nuisances like Mondays and hailstorms. If art reflects the times, this art reflects a collective desire to decamp to some place with beautiful natural light and no visible charging cables. While Mr. Malin claims he knows “like, no artists,” some have taken note.",
		"29" : "“I get jealous sometimes,” Mr. Ugalde said. “I get jealous in a very positive way. He’s very young, he’s not trying to influence the collector or the observer with big philosophical, conceptual messages. Sometimes, it’s just to make people happy.”"

I am an only child, my father is dead, and my close friends are women. So, my 12-year-old boy is without an adult male role model. I would like him to have one. A close friend has a wonderful son in college who will soon be coming home for the summer. Would it be crazy if I asked my friend (or her son) if he would be willing to hang out with my son?",
		"2" : "ANN MARIE, NEW YORK",
		"3" : "Crazy? No. But awkward and unlikely to achieve your goal? Most definitely. Twenty-year-olds and preteenagers are not natural playmates — unless you are living in the world of early Judd Apatow films. (And you probably don’t want your son hanging out with that version of Seth Rogen.) Even if you shared your motives with your friend, it seems unlikely to me that you will squeeze more than an outing or two from a kindhearted Joe College.",

Depending on their interests (and your budget), they can play tennis in the park or go to dinner and a movie. Meanwhile, you can join a book club or catch up on your me-time. Win-win, right?",
		"5" : "Now, this advice runs counter to Mike Mills’s terrific film, “20th Century Women,” in which Annette Bening, in a situation like yours, enlists even more women to help her raise a good man. Surrounding your son with good people, regardless of their gender, is your first move. But I get your desire for him to see how stand-up men operate in the world. (Also, check with your son’s teacher for school-sponsored options.)",

This excludes calls or messages that seek to guilt him into replying to you.",

I am here for you if you need anything, day or night. Pick up the phone whenever you want to talk.” Trying to wheedle your way into more than that would be selfish — which I’m pretty sure you don’t mean to be. (But even if you do, don’t.)"

		"1" : "Over the past decade, Tinsley Mortimer has done a lot. For starters, she divorced her high school sweetheart, Topper Mortimer, wrote a novel titled “Southern Charm,” starred in a much-maligned reality show called “High Society,” started a clothing line and inspired a Christian Dior lip gloss called Tinsley Pink. She has also relinquished her position on top of the New York social heap for a (relatively) quieter life in Palm Beach, Fla., where, last year, she was accused by the police of  trespassing on her on-again, off-again boyfriend’s property.",
		"2" : "Through it all, one thing has remained consistent. Her hair color.",
		"3" : "This is thanks to Kyle White, a stylist at the Oscar Blandi Salon in Midtown Manhattan whom she has visited regularly — about every six weeks — even during her sojourn in South Florida.",
		"4" : "“I had been doing my color with some other guy, and it was patchy and splotchy,” Ms. Mortimer said the other afternoon while in Mr. White’s chair.",
		"5" : "“It was an optical illusion,” Mr. White said of her former hair. “I was trying to figure it out like it was a Rubik’s Cube.”",
		"6" : "Ms. Mortimer, who grew up in Richmond, Va., said she was born a blonde. But brunette roots began to show, and she started highlighting in sixth grade.",
		"7" : "“I haven’t seen my natural hair color in 20 years,” said Ms. Mortimer, who is 41. “Being blond just makes me feel happier, like when the sun’s hitting you. The blond pops. It’s cheerful.”",
		"8" : "As Mr. White wrapped Ms. Mortimer’s hair with foil, he described her particular hue as “multitonal — a soft baby blond with a golden blond base; she has icy and buttery pieces.”",
		"9" : "They met about 15 years ago through Lauren Santo Domingo, another onetime social queen bee who, in 2010, became a founder of an online fashion retail site called Moda Operandi.",
		"10" : "Ms. Mortimer and those icy and buttery pieces have returned to New York at a time when the term socialite isn’t as fashionable as it once was. Socialites now identify themselves as “entrepreneurs or business women or moms,” she said.",
		"11" : "“The word isn’t used anymore,” she continued. “Not that I ever asked for it.”",
		"12" : "There is another path for women formerly known as socialites. It’s the path of the Real Housewife. This is Ms. Mortimer’s. A few weeks ago, she marked her first appearance on “The Real Housewives of New York City,” Bravo’s long-running series, which has not had much luck with new cast members in recent years. (Jules Wainstein left after one season; Kristin Taekman and Aviva Drescher after two.)",
		"13" : "As Ms. Mortimer tells it, after her fracas in Florida in spring 2016, Sonja Morgan, a cast member whom she knew from the New York social circuit and whose hair is also colored by Mr. White, invited her to stay at her Upper East Side townhouse. One thing led to another.",
		"14" : "Ms. Mortimer jumped at the chance to get out of Palm Beach. “It’s very small. Everyone knows your business, from a 15-year-old to a 90-year-old.” She moved there, she explained, to get away from the spotlight: “I wanted to be a beachy girl. I was over dressing up.”",
		"15" : "But then, she said, she had a realization: “I am not the beachy girl. I don’t wear flip-flops and beachy dresses. I’m not as poufy and girlie, but I am the girl who dresses up.”",
		"16" : "Now, when Ms. Mortimer reminisces about her life in New York, she wonders why she ever wanted to leave it.",
		"17" : "“Oh, my God, I look back at all these magazines and I realize that I did a lot,” she said, waiting patiently for her hair color to set. “It was an amazing time. I don’t know why I wanted to walk away from that. I didn’t realize the scale of it. I never saw myself as this big socialite, but from an outsider point of view, there was a lot going on.”",
		"18" : "That included an appearance on “Gossip Girl” and those eight episodes of “High Society.” “It was over-sensationalized and I got some flak for it,” she said of the series. “But I don’t have any regrets.”",
		"19" : "Mr. White returned to check her progress. “I loved that show; you were like the sophisticated grande dame,” he said. “People are just jealous of Tinsley.” She smiled demurely at him in the salon mirror as Justin Bieber’s “Sorry” played.",
		"20" : "She is a bit anxious, she said, about her return to reality television on a show where a co-star, Bethenny Frankel, has already described her as having “the whole world at her fingertips and kind of crashed and burned.”",
		"21" : "But the series affords her the opportunity to return to Manhattan, and to do so with that new and all important accessory, a job.",
		"22" : "She expects to dip a toe in the social swirl, including reacquainting herself with charities in which she was once involved, such as New Yorkers for Children, a nonprofit on the gala circuit. But for now, she said, it’s about “getting to know the city again.”",
		"23" : "One thing about New York that Ms. Mortimer likes, she explained, as Mr. White smeared on the last bits of dye: “If you want to hide, you can hide.”",
		"24" : "“New York is my town,” she added. And then it was time for a rinse."

Many wept openly. Sometimes Abramovic cried, too. To really experience the power of eye contact, she suggests a minimum of one hour of sustained gaze.",

Don’t look away. Eye contact elicits avoidance behavior in many species, but humans are exquisitely attuned to it. Even newborns will look longer at people staring straight at them than they will at those with averted eyes. Neuroimaging studies show that direct gaze changes how human brains develop and function, particularly the cortical and subcortical regions that scientists call “the social brain,” which underlies the ability to empathize.",

While we need to look at our loved ones more, she says that gazing into the eyes of strangers is potentially more transformative, what she calls “one of the most powerful experiences you can have.” Still, don’t go wandering around the streets staring at people. “It can be dangerous,” says Abramovic, who would like to see eye-gazing stations built into hotel lobbies and malls. Until that happens, she suggests organizing group meet-ups through social media.",

		"1" : "RE: RECONSIDERING THE RIGHT",
		"2" : "Rick Perlstein wrote about the new direction of American conservatism after the election of Donald Trump.",
		"3" : "Historians of American political culture have actually done pretty well understanding the race and class dynamics of the “hard-hat conservatism” that Perlstein sees as having fueled the Trump election.",
		"4" : "What they don’t get is the more diffuse, anti-rational, emotion-driven energies that animate large parts of the electorate. Magical thinking has always had a prominent place in American popular culture. It has been normalized most recently by the rise of prosperity gospels, remote-prayer healing and power-of-mind texts like “The Secret.” Unlike proto-fascism and racism, however, such commitments typically seem ridiculous and unworthy of scrutiny to secular intellectuals.",
		"5" : "Yes, the bigoted history of 20th-century populism is one tradition that led to Trump’s election. But we can’t understand populism — in 2017 or in American history more broadly — unless we fully engage with its adherents’ underlying epistemologies. Such an engagement means first acknowledging, as Richard Hofstadter did, that those ways of thinking are different from our own. Next, we have to try to find a way to work with those adherents. Hofstadter failed spectacularly at that; I’d like to see Rick Perlstein at least try. Trysh Travis, Gainesville, Fla.",
		"6" : "Although Rick Perlstein encourages historians of the American right in the age of Trump to be more “impolite” in their assessments of the movement, he treads surprisingly lightly when it comes to race’s place in the story of that movement.",
		"7" : "His focus is on connections with European-style fascism, immigration backlash and the politicization of advertising and reality television. While all of these have certainly played a role in the rise of the movement that brought Trump to power, it is impossible to imagine the rise of Trump without focusing squarely on two primary factors: the right’s unwavering hostility to the nation’s first African-American president and Trump’s harnessing of racist impulses in the white working-class electorate that had been allowed to simmer but came to a full boil in 2016. Underplaying the central role of race in that story is a disservice to the readership of this magazine. Clinton J. Guthrie, Queens",
		"8" : "I was surprised by Rick Perlstein’s self-flagellating confession in the magazine. I’ve thought for some time that he is one of our best chroniclers of the rise of a determined, resilient and mercurial American Right. In his books, Perlstein has written deftly and vividly about the cultural undercurrents and strains of racial animus and populist anger that were missed or dismissed by many who had prematurely declared the extreme right permanently overextended or on the verge of extinction. In fact, watching the political drama of the primary and general elections unfold over the past two years, I was reminded of his books and thought, This is Perlstein’s next book, writing itself. Unlike the author, I was not surprised by the outcome of the last election, in part, because of reading his rich and insightful history of the modern conservative movement. Paul Scully, Collingswood, N.J.",
		"9" : "RE: MIKE JUDGE",
		"10" : "Willy Staley profiled Mike Judge, the creator of “Idiocracy” and co-creator of “Silicon Valley,” as America’s foremost chronicler of its own self-destructive tendencies.",
		"11" : "After reading this article, I Googled Judge. I found an old skit similar to Sean Spicer’s gaffe about the Holocaust. In it, a talk-show host interviews a multimillionaire who complains about Holocaust-like persecution of multimillionaires. One concludes that Judge’s assessment of the American soul is as prescient as the article states. Sidney Vaneyck Sisk, Avon, Conn.",
		"12" : "Describing “Idiocracy” as anything approaching prescient is purposefully misinterpreting events to fit the narrative and is hypocritical from a liberal point of view.",
		"13" : "Let us not forget the beginning of “Idiocracy,” in which the poor family, portrayed as dumb and trashy, was procreating out of control. The intelligent and educated couple waits, struggles, then eventually has a single child. This is the setup to explain how things get to where they are in 2505 — “dumb” people breeding like rabbits and “smart” people not. Eventually this imbalance turns the country into a society full of morons.",
		"14" : "I would suppose that outside the context of this article, most liberal-minded folks (myself included) would find the insinuation that poor equals dumb offensive. For some reason, this film seems to get a pass. We surely give conservatives and the Republican Party a lot of flak for their siding with the wealthy and privileged and valuing a person’s wealth as a major metric of his worth. Isn’t that effectively what “Idiocracy” is doing? Jonathan Owens, Albany"

	"date" : "2017-04-29",
	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/movies/michael-reeves-horror-movies.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "Credited with directing three déclassé horror movies, dead from an overdose of barbiturates at 25, the British filmmaker Michael Reeves (1943-1969) is a quintessential cult figure.",
		"2" : "Reeves, like Steven Spielberg and the avant-gardist brothers George and Mike Kuchar, made eight-millimeter films in his movie-obsessed youth and, on a trip to America, paid an unannounced visit to his Hollywood idol, the genre director Don Siegel — an act of chutzpah that actually resulted in a job. After working in commercials and as an assistant director, Reeves made and even partly financed his first feature, “Revenge of the Blood Beast” (1966), newly out on Blu-ray from Raro Video.",
		"3" : "Also known as “The She Beast,” this low-budget Italian production, set in contemporary Transylvania, gave top billing to Barbara Steele, beloved by buffs for her roles in Mario Bava’s “Black Sunday” (1960) and Roger Corman’s “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961). That Ms. Steele was only available to shoot for a few days demanded pragmatism from Reeves. She appears as a haughty British honeymooner who, once possessed by the malignant spirit of a medieval witch, mutates into a hideous, murderous crone played, under thick, pustulant makeup, by a male actor.",
		"4" : "This amalgam of the awful and the audacious is a demented gross-out comedy that often evokes the early work of John Waters. It clearly amused Reeves to depict modern Transylvania as a shabby police state ruled by inept policemen. Much of the action takes place in the run-down Hotel Moskva; one gruesome attack winks at Communist iconography when the weapon — a sickle — is tossed away to land neatly on a hammer. There is also some effective filmmaking. A flashback in which an accused witch is put to death by hysterical townspeople previews similar lynch-mob sequences in Reeves’s last and strongest film, “Witchfinder General” (1968).",
		"5" : "Before “Witchfinder General,” however, Reeves directed, and partly wrote, “The Sorcerers” (1967), a seedy evocation of swinging London complete with Soho clubs and third-rate beat bands; Boris Karloff stars as the inventor of a device for inducing hypnotic trances. Karloff’s gizmo evokes motion-picture technology while the notion of movies as a form of mind control is further elaborated upon when the inventor and his deranged wife (the distinguished actress Catherine Lacey) program a feckless young mod (Ian Ogilvy, Ms. Steele’s husband in “Revenge of the Blood Beast”) to embark on a career of extreme naughtiness.",
		"6" : "As self-reflexive as it is, “The Sorcerers” (available on DVD from Warner Archive) has been compared to Michael Powell’s “Peeping Tom” (1960). Better written than directed, “The Sorcerers” is at once an evocation of psychedelic fascism and a Freudian comedy with a hapless protagonist subject to subliminal prompts from two parental figures.",
		"7" : "“Witchfinder General,” set in mid-17th-century East Anglia during the English Civil War between the forces of Oliver Cromwell and Charles I, is the movie in which Reeves brought it all together. Reportedly bullied by his young director into a serious performance, Vincent Price is truly frightening as the sanctimonious sadist Matthew Hopkins, a historical figure who used torture and blackmail to “discover” Catholic witches among the peasantry.",
		"8" : "Redolent of social breakdown (and retitled “Edgar Allan Poe’s The Conqueror Worm”), the movie was released in the United States in August 1968, a season of acute political violence. The New York Times reviewer Renata Adler, who saw it at a 42nd Street theater, seemed as interested in the audience as she was in the tumult onscreen: “A man behind me snored and a middle-aged couple next to him quarreled viciously, but people woke up for the action and particularly cheered when Price was hacked to death.” Some years later, the Village Voice critic William Paul caught “Witchfinder General” and — in a review that established Reeves’s posthumous American reputation — declared him “the most audacious visual talent to have come out of England since Hitchcock.”",
		"9" : "“Witchfinder General” has been released on disc several times, most recently on Blu-ray as one of six films included in Scream’s “Vincent Price Collection.” Perhaps some altruistic distributor will thrill cultists with a Reeves collection, even including “Castle of the Living Dead,” a 1964 French-Italian vehicle for Christopher Lee that some fans believe was mainly shot, uncredited, by Reeves, the second-unit director.",
		"10" : "“Witchfinder General” is a classic example of florid gothic cinema, a British exploitation mode that, along with Italian westerns, graced the grungy movie houses of the 1960s and early 1970s. “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988), new on Blu-ray from Vestron, might be considered a one-off revival of the mode, directed by Britain’s master of high-minded hysteria, Ken Russell.",
		"11" : "The suitably outlandish plot, loosely adapted from a novel by Bram Stoker, concerns an outbreak of pagan snake-worship in present-day Derbyshire. The young Hugh Grant is surprisingly intense as a drawling young lord, but the movie is stolen by a neighboring aristocrat, played by Amanda Donohoe (known then mainly as an associate of the New Wave singer Adam Ant). Fabulously chic and seductively sinister, Ms. Donohoe is actually a vampire priestess, prone to coldblooded hissy fits, sprouting fangs at will and spraying a venom that transports victims into a mad delirium of screaming nuns, rampaging serpents and bloody crucifixions.",
		"12" : "One of Mr. Russell’s most enjoyable films, “White Worm” seems a uniquely British amalgam of high camp, lurid psychedelia and rowdy Celtic folk-punk. As regional as “Witchfinder General,” it feasts on the Midlands countryside. Setting the movie in England rather than Transylvania, Mr. Russell told Film Comment magazine, “made it potentially more alarming — and, of course, absurdly comical.”",
		"13" : "NEWLY RELEASED",
		"14" : "THE BOY FRIEND First released in 1971 and now out on Blu-ray, Ken Russell’s knowingly retro movie version of Sandy Wilson’s already retro stage musical is overdue for re-evaluation, post “La La Land.” Twiggy stars in the Ruby Keeler role; Glenda Jackson has a memorable, uncredited walk-on as the diva she supplants. (Warner Archive)",
		"15" : "DEMON SEED Best known for his collaboration with Nicolas Roeg on the Mick Jagger film “Performance,” as well as an appearance in Kenneth Anger’s occult short “Lucifer Rising,” Donald Cammell directed his first solo film in 1977 — a kinky technophobic thriller, now reissued on Blu-ray, in which Julie Christie is impregnated by a rogue computer. (Warner Archive)",
		"16" : "THE LOVE WITCH Anna Biller’s sly, stylish and sardonic tale of female fantasy and Wiccan romance run amok is many things, including a homage to the gaudy, sexually charged horror films of the late ’60s and early ’70s. “Ms. Biller’s movie, like its heroine, presents a fascinating, perfectly composed, brightly colored surface,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in November 2016. On Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video. (Oscilloscope)",
		"17" : "MULTIPLE MANIACS John Waters’s second feature, made in 1970, is in some ways his most transgressive — a satire of a Manson Family-like cult, starring Divine, designed to appall hippies and, he has said, “shock the world.” In addition to interviews with cast and crew members, extras include audio commentary by Mr. Waters himself. On Blu-ray and DVD. (Criterion)",
		"18" : "THE VAMPIRE BAT Newly restored by the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive and now on Blu-ray, this 1933 “Dracula” knockoff was a surprisingly atmospheric film from a small studio, Majestic. Renting stars from the majors, it features Lionel Atwill, Melvyn Douglas and Fay Wray, as well as one strikingly economical use of color. (The Film Detective)"

		"1" : "Melissa Breyer moved to New York to become a painter and ended up becoming a waitress, first at a pasta place in Greenwich Village, then at a bar and grill in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She enjoyed the social aspect of the work, but especially the quiet moments, when she could daydream “about the books I was reading or conversations I wanted to have or shoes I would like,” she said. “Things I wanted to do, places I wanted to go.” As she made the transition to photographer, writer and website editor, she found herself drawn to the stories playing out behind the windows of the restaurants she passed. The waitresses, especially, caught her attention. When they weren’t reciting the nightly specials or balancing dinner for four on one arm, what were they thinking? The photographs here, taken from either side of the restaurant window, ask this question without trying to answer it.",
		"2" : "“They all have lives,” she said. “They have a place where they live and have histories. When they’re paused in reverie, that’s the entry point for where the stories begin. I make up narratives for them sometimes. Maybe one of them is practicing to be a Rockette. There’re so many possibilities. This is a city of eight and a half million separate films. Each person is a film. I say, ‘Here’s the star of a story.’”",
		"3" : "If the waitresses shown are like their photographer, one thing they were not thinking about was how to tell the big tippers from the cheapskates, Ms. Breyer said. “I never made an effort to figure that out,” she said, adding that “the best thing is when you’re completely surprised.” She did, however develop a condition common among former servers, she said. “I’m guilty of extravagant tipping, even if the service is terrible,” she said. “I just say, ‘Maybe they’re having a bad day.’”"

		"1" : "Elana Shneyer and Adam Kaufman live a few hundred feet from Public School 165, the Robert E. Simon School, on West 109th Street, at the edge of Morningside Heights in Manhattan. When they started looking for a kindergarten for their son, who will start in the fall, the school was an early stop.",
		"2" : "That made them unusual.",
		"3" : "Although their neighborhood is diverse, the children who go to P.S. 165, its zoned school, are mostly Hispanic and low-income. Most of the white students who live in the area it serves attend school elsewhere.",
		"4" : "But Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman, who are white, liked that the school had a Spanish dual-language program and that its kindergarten classes had only 10 to 15 students.",
		"5" : "They also knew they had options. Community School District 3, where they live, has a long history of giving parents alternatives to their zoned schools. So the couple also looked at the Manhattan School for Children, a progressive school that is open to all children in the district. The couple loved the school’s approach, particularly its commitment to integrating children with physical disabilities. But there was one thing that made them uncomfortable: While most of the students in District 3 are black or Hispanic, nearly two-thirds of the students at Manhattan School for Children are white.",
		"6" : "“We noticed that, and honestly, to us it was less appealing,” Ms. Shneyer said.",
		"7" : "She went to public school in District 3, at P.S. 75, the Emily Dickinson School, on West End Avenue between 95th and 96th Streets. Less than a fifth of the students were white, a percentage that hasn’t changed much over time. She went on to the Bronx High School of Science, one of the city’s most selective high schools.",
		"8" : "“I think public school shaped me in a lot of ways — that I feel like I can relate and talk to and be with people who are different from me racially, economically, socially,” Ms. Shneyer said. “It was very valuable in that way.”",
		"9" : "A look at the history of District 3, which stretches along the West Side of Manhattan from 59th to 122nd Street, shows how administrators’ decisions, combined with the choices of parents and the forces of gentrification, have shaped the current state of its schools, which, in one of the most politically liberal parts of a liberal city, remain sharply divided by race and income, and just as sharply divergent in their levels of academic achievement.",
		"10" : "In 1984, two years before Ms. Shneyer started kindergarten, less than 8 percent of the district’s 12,321 elementary and middle school students were white. Not a single school was majority white, and the only school where white students made up the biggest group was P.S. 87 on West 78th Street. At the time, many white parents would not even consider their zoned schools. James Mazza, who served as deputy superintendent, and then superintendent of the district, from 1988 to 1997, recalled in an interview that parents would sometimes come into his office carrying a newspaper with the test scores of every school in the district and explain that they didn’t want to go to their zoned school because of its place on the list. Though scores are often used as a shorthand for quality, they correlate closely with the socioeconomic level of the children in a school.",
		"11" : "“We tried to encourage people to make the decision about what school to attend based on more information than test-score results,” Mr. Mazza said, adding that that was often difficult. So the district pursued another strategy for attracting white, middle-class families: adding gifted classrooms, dual-language programs and schools that were open to all students from around the district.",
		"12" : "Thanks to these options, more white families began sending their children to District 3 elementary and middle schools. Today, over a third of the roughly 14,000 elementary and middle school students in District 3 are white. But they are unevenly distributed. All but one of the zoned elementary schools below West 90th Street are now majority white. But because white parents elsewhere in the district take advantage of alternatives to their zoned schools, elementary schools in more ethnically diverse neighborhoods, like Manhattan Valley and Morningside Heights, remain largely black and Hispanic, and poor. Their test scores trail those of the district’s mostly white schools, and as the neighborhoods gentrify, their enrollment is declining.",
		"13" : "The New York City Education Department has not put forward a plan to address the district’s growing disparities. Last year, the city withdrew a proposal to merge two elementary schools in Harlem because of low enrollment after parents protested.",
		"14" : "P.S. 145, the Bloomingdale School, is on West 105th Street, four blocks south of P.S. 165. A quarter of its students live in temporary housing. Last year, just 15 percent of third- through fifth-grade students passed the state reading tests, and only 7 percent passed the math tests. In recent years, less than half of the kindergartners living in P.S. 145’s zone who attended public school enrolled there. Some go to P.S. 75, others to the Manhattan School for Children or to charter schools.",
		"15" : "Scott Seamon, a lawyer who works in finance, lives in the area served by P.S. 145 and has twin boys who will start kindergarten in 2018. Given the school’s test scores, he said, “I feel like it would almost be malpractice to send my kids to school there, while the schools in the 70s and 80s have like a 70 percent passage rate.”",
		"16" : "In the case of P.S. 165, only two in five of the kindergartners who lived in the school’s zone and attended public school were enrolled there in 2015, according to Education Department data. White families disproportionately shun the school: Roughly a third of the public school students who live in the school’s zone are white, but only 13 percent of the school’s students are white. Its test scores, like those at the other district schools where black and Hispanic children are a majority, lag behind.",
		"17" : "Brett Gallini was the principal of P.S. 165 from 2010 to 2012, when he left to lead a charter school. Mr. Gallini said the school was underrated by many middle-class families in its zone. “I spent a lot of my time when I was a principal of 165 just advocating for the school, saying, ‘You know what, I can’t just tell you it’s a great school — come see it,’” he said. He said the school started offering more tours and parents would host meet-and-greets at their apartments for prospective parents.",
		"18" : "Mr. Gallini also asked parents in the neighborhood what they were looking for. The school was phasing out its gifted program when he arrived. Based on interest from parents, he decided to revive it, which proved popular, though many of its students come from elsewhere in the district.",
		"19" : "The current principal, Aracelis Castellano-Folk, attended the school in the early 1970s, and has moved to improve P.S. 165’s instruction, with two full-time teacher coaches for English language arts and math, and a new math program. Her efforts have paid off in higher test scores: Last year 47 percent of third- through fifth-grade students passed the state English exam, and 42 percent passed the math exam, up from 24 percent and 35 percent the year before. But Ms. Castellano-Folk seems to be less effective than Mr. Gallini was at selling the school to prospective parents. Enrollment, after rebounding under Mr. Gallini, has again declined.",
		"20" : "Some of the school’s Hispanic parents have complaints of their own.",
		"21" : "Fatima Ortiz, 40, attended P.S. 165 and has sent three children there. Two have already graduated, and one, a son, is currently in fourth grade. She said she didn’t feel the school was safe, adding that there was bullying and children were inadequately supervised. One of her older children attends Mott Hall II, a middle school in the same building, and she said that at that school, parents were welcome to walk into the office anytime. But she said that was not true at P.S. 165. “From my point of view, I think, ‘What are they hiding?’” she said.",
		"22" : "(Ms. Castellano-Folk said that the students’ safety was her highest priority and that parents were invited to an informal meeting with her once a month.)",
		"23" : "Ms. Ortiz didn’t think having more white or upper-middle-class parents in the school would necessarily improve it, since she thought that they would mostly push for programs that benefited their own children. She said it seemed that Ms. Castellano-Folk already gave parents in the gifted program preferential treatment.",
		"24" : "Others expressed positive feelings about the school.",
		"25" : "Milagros Bueno, whose son is in second grade in the dual-language program, said that the teachers were wonderful, and that her son was thriving. Unlike Ms. Ortiz, she thought that having more racial diversity and more wealthy families would be good for the school.",
		"26" : "“More affluent families mean that the school gets a better rating and also that we get more funding, because they definitely advocate,” she said. “As people of color, unfortunately we don’t do as much advocating as them.”",
		"27" : "On a tour for prospective parents in January, Ms. Castellano-Folk answered a query about the construction that had taken over the school’s play yard for younger students by saying she was not sure when it would end. “I don’t know that it’s a plan,” she said of the Education Department’s oversight, adding that it was supposed to be a two-year project but “things come up.” When another parent asked how the school celebrated religious holidays, she said curtly, “We can’t use that term.”",
		"28" : "On the morning that Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman visited the school, Ms. Castellano-Folk joined their tour at the end, walkie-talkie in hand. Ms. Shneyer asked several questions: Could the principal talk about the school’s approach to discipline? How did the school challenge students who were advanced? What was the interaction between the upper grades and lower grades?",
		"29" : "The couple were satisfied with Ms. Castellano-Folk’s answers, but the school’s falling numbers were evident. That morning a dual-language kindergarten class had only five students present. A second-grade class had fewer than 20 students. Several of the schools in the district’s southern portion have kindergarten waiting lists.",
		"30" : "Ms. Shneyer said later that she was impressed with the math program and liked the small class sizes, though Mr. Kaufman expressed concern about what low enrollment might mean for the school’s budget.",
		"31" : "“That was a surprise,” he said.",
		"32" : "“It seems like a benefit, smaller classes,” Ms. Shneyer said, adding, “People pay a lot of money to send their kids to places with low student-teacher ratio.”",
		"33" : "The couple’s kindergarten application was due Jan. 13. Though they remained concerned about Manhattan School for Children’s demographics, they had decided to rank it first on their application.",
		"34" : "“There’s a coherent vision for the school,” Mr. Kaufman said. “You can see that articulated through small and large decisions that are enacted through the school, and that really appealed to me.”",
		"35" : "But the odds seemed to be against them — 989 children entered the lottery for 90 seats — so they figured their son was most likely destined to attend the dual-language program at P.S. 165, their second choice.",
		"36" : "Manhattan School for Children was started in 1992 by a group of parents from the P.S. 165 zone who felt unwelcome at the school. Although the school is now on West 93rd Street, it originally opened in the 165 building. Its founders had actually shared Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman’s concerns about diversity, and in the early years the school consciously selected classes that were about one-third white, 10 percent Asian and the rest black and Hispanic.",
		"37" : "But roughly a decade ago, the Education Department told the school that it had to run a more formal lottery for kindergarten seats, in which students’ ethnicity could not be considered. Within a few years, the school was mostly white.",
		"38" : "Neither the District 3 superintendent, Ilene Altschul, nor Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña seems to have a vision for how to deal with the district’s segregation and the achievement gap between its schools. The zone lines for 11 of the district’s elementary schools were redrawn last year, but the new lines will probably change the demographics of only a few schools, at most. Ms. Altschul would say only that she was focused on “ensuring that all students in District 3 are provided with a high-quality education.”",
		"39" : "In the end, Ms. Shneyer and Mr. Kaufman’s son won a lottery spot at Manhattan School for Children, and one of his best friends got a seat there, as well.",
		"40" : "The deadline to accept the offer was April 7, and after some agonizing, they did so.",
		"41" : "Mr. Kaufman is happy that the process is mostly behind them, while Ms. Shneyer is still ambivalent, holding out the possibility that they could change their minds and switch to P.S. 165 before school starts.",
		"42" : "She said that most of all, they had wanted to find the school that was the best fit for their son. But she said she was also aware that decisions like theirs have an impact on whether schools thrive, or do not. In other words, the decision is more than just a personal one.",
		"43" : "“Putting our child there, we’re investing our time in a school,” Ms. Shneyer said. “Where do we want to do that?”"

CG: I’ve started to get into lifting. Wherever we’re at, we’re at an Equinox at some point during the day. It’s good to be able to do that for yourself.",
		"5" : "SUSTENANCE SG: After that, we go for brunch. CP: A lot of times we go to Lovely Day, and I always get the same thing. I like a glass of wine after the gym, because it really carries you. SG: Chris gets the salmon and I get the strawberry pancakes, sometimes with wine, sometimes without. If we don’t go to Lovely Day, then we’ll go to Dimes. Dimes is kind of like our go-to place every day. We go to Dimes grocery almost seven days a week for whatever. CP: Food is superimportant. I probably like food about as much as I like clothes. SG: And food is something that we have never skimped on. Whatever happens, we are always eating well, just for general morale.",
		"6" : "CULTURE VULTURES SG: By around 3, if we’re not at home spacing out on the sofa, we go to a museum. MoMA is my favorite: I love the architecture; I love the courtyard; I love being up a couple levels and looking over that central space on the second floor. Then we high-tail it back down to our neighborhood, on the F train.",
		"7" : "DINNER WITH FRIENDS SG: On Sunday nights, we’ve been, for the last little while, having friends over at our place. CP: For dinner parties, which is great. We’ve been living here for four years, but we finally feel that we have the right matrix of friends where we can have interesting parties of different people. SG: It took us a while in New York City to find those people that also connected with each other, but now we have that group of people, which is really nice. CP: A lot of our friends are people who also work in fashion and travel a lot, so it’s exciting when people come back into town because you get to catch up quite a bit.",
		"8" : "RETRO RECIPES CP: We buy a lot of vintage cookbooks on eBay. We’ll be like: We’ll just try all these recipes, and just wing it. SG: The cookbook that we use the most is called the “Japanese Country Cookbook.” CP: A lot of times, you’ll look at the recipe and be like, how hard could this be? Ten lines down they’re like, you’re supposed to have vinegared the potatoes the night before. And you’re like: O.K., wait — what? This is crazy!",
		"9" : "PARTY DOWN CP: We’ll have maybe six people over, and you’ll lose a couple people at 9:30. You’ll lose a couple more at maybe 10:30, and then the last group, when you’re having a lot of fun, leaves at midnight or 1. We end up drinking a lot of wine, hanging out and talking about things."

		"1" : "In 1953, when her youngest child was born, Dana Mazurek’s life looked a lot like the lives of other women of her generation.",
		"2" : "Born in rural West Virginia, she met Ed when she was a striking 21-year-old and he a handsome Marine who had recently returned from the Pacific theater. They were married within a year and headed for Chicago to live near his Polish-American family. By the time Dana was 30, she was a homemaker with five children, all skinny like their mom and blond like their dad, with the kinds of names that sound perfect for a charming family sitcom: Rosie, Mikey, Vicky, Timmy, Mary.",
		"3" : "Behind closed doors, though, life didn’t look like 1950s TV. “These days we call it domestic abuse,” Mary, Dana’s youngest, told me. But back then she would just say, “He beat me up.”",
		"4" : "Dana stayed, until she didn’t: She and Ed divorced when Mary was 2.",
		"5" : "Dana was 32 with five kids under the age of 12, two of them still in diapers, to support on her own, in an era of staunchly conservative family values — single mothers were rare, and divorced women pariahs.",
		"6" : "She didn’t have formal education past high school or much in the way of work history, but someone had to keep the lights on, and the $56 in monthly child support that she had to take Ed to court to get wasn’t going to cut it. And so Dana had two or three jobs at a time: She worked as a crossing guard from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m., and then as a waitress from 4 p.m. until midnight. She took other odd jobs, selling Avon for a while, working at a soap factory for a while — whatever would pay the bills. While she worked, she cobbled together child care, and the older kids often looked after the younger ones.",
		"7" : "“All my life I remember her always saying her legs hurt,” Mary said. “ ‘My legs are killing me, my legs are killing me.’ She was never off of ’em very much.”",
		"8" : "This was not typical 1950s womanhood. In 1955, most adult women were married. Fewer than a third of married women worked, and fewer than a quarter of marriages ended in divorce; even most divorced, widowed or separated women were not in the paid work force. But watching her mother’s life taught Mary an important lesson: For women, work also meant independence.",
		"9" : "That didn’t mean, however, that work brought happiness, fulfillment or purpose. That work could be central to women’s lives and identities was not then, and is not now, the dominant way we think about women and work.",
		"10" : "We have a broad understanding that work is valuable for men, that it feeds their sense of importance as providers and meets some existential need related to identity and sense of self. This force is potent enough to be one factor that may have swung the 2016 elections: Working-class white men, out of work and watching blue-collar jobs dry up, lost their mooring as providers, and cast their ballots for a man who promised to take them back in time.",
		"11" : "Historically, women weren’t supposed to need their individual identity to be formed through work, because women weren’t supposed to have individual identities at all: They melded into their husband’s identity when they married. Women’s identities have long been relational — daughter, wife, mother — rather than individual.",
		"12" : "Which is perhaps why today, women finding individual identities tied to their work makes so many people uncomfortable — why people are so quick to assert that we can’t “have it all,” why the American government and workplaces are so slow to implement policies that would enable us to at least have something a little better.",
		"13" : "The “Leave It to Beaver” era during which Dana Mazurek raised her children was a historical aberration, but one many Americans continue to idolize. While the majority of Americans today — nearly 80 percent — do not think women should return to traditional wife-and-homemaker roles, something shifts when you replace “woman” with “mother”: Just over half of Americans believe children are better off with a mother who is at home full time and does not hold a job. Only 8 percent say the same thing about fathers.",
		"14" : "Perhaps the defining characteristic of the 1950s was women’s turn to the domestic, the first time in recorded American history where women got married sooner and had more babies than their mothers. The prevailing sensibility was that life as a suburban housewife was supposed to bring ultimate happiness.",
		"15" : "But the pursuit of personal fulfillment was less about what actually made women happy and more about money — and men being able to make it without competing with women. Men’s wages rose steadily through the 1950s and ’60s, while women’s stagnated. Although women had earned more than 63 percent of what men did in the early 1950s, by the mid-1960s they made less than 58 percent.",
		"16" : "By the mid-1960s, the cultural blip of the hyperdomestic ’50s was showing signs of decline. Mary, Dana’s youngest daughter, turned 10 the same year Betty Friedan published “The Feminine Mystique,” the book that prompted mostly white, middle-class, stay-at-home mothers to ask themselves, “Is this all?” A few years later, as Mary prepared for high school, both Dana and Ed expected her to attend Jones Commercial, a secretarial training school, instead of a traditional school.",
		"17" : "“This is the late ’60s with the Vietnam War, with women’s lib starting, and the rules for this secretary school were you had to wear a hat, white gloves, your skirts had to be midknee, and you had to wear pantyhose and heels,” Mary said. “This is when kids were in jeans. I would have to walk down the street in a hat and gloves and pantyhose, going to secretary school when everybody else was having sit-ins. I hated it. After six weeks I begged my mom to let me go back to the regular high school, and she never batted an eye — she said yes.”",
		"18" : "After high school she went to nursing school at the local community college, and at 19 started dating Mike, a guy from her South Side neighborhood, who was paying his way through law school by working at the local steel mill. In 1978, when he was 25 and she was 24, they got married. By 1981, they were off to Seattle for Mike’s job. She worked as a nurse the whole time, and at 29 she had her first child — me.",
		"19" : "I was born in 1983, and my sister was born a year and a half later. My mom scaled back, working the night shift two days a week so that she could be home with us during the day. Leaving her kids was wrenching — “there are not descriptive emotional words to explain the thought of being away from your babies” — but the family needed her income, and she also liked her job and what it meant for her independence.",
		"20" : "Unlike my grandmother, whose status as a divorced working mother made her an outlier, my mother was a woman of her generation. Between 1950 and 2000, the number of hours married women spent at work more than doubled. While married black women have long been more likely to work outside the home than their white counterparts, they also saw their workplace participation skyrocket in the same half-century.",
		"21" : "In the 1970s, when my mom was working her first few jobs, women across the country were surging into the work force, and for the first time more than half of American women between the ages of 25 and 54 worked outside the home. By the time I went to college, more than 75 percent of women in the same age group were in the labor force. I expected to be one of them.",
		"22" : "And yet, for all the emphasis modern adults place on the dreams of the young — asking boys and girls what they want to be when they grow up — Americans remain ambivalent about whether adult women working, and especially mothers working, is actually a good thing.",
		"23" : "The idealized vision of 1950s womanhood that still permeates our politics ignores the fact that staying home may not actually make mothers happy. Unfortunately, there’s no robust feminist ideal to counter it. Instead, we fall back on the language of “choice”: that it’s best if women simply get to choose to work or stay home, as if these choices are inherently equal and made without carrying the cultural baggage of sacrificial American motherhood. Or the fact that inhospitable workplaces and economic constraints mean many women never have a real choice in the matter at all.",
		"24" : "That feminists are so often unable or unwilling to make a vigorous moral argument in favor of women working outside the home is perhaps one reason we have not yet seen the political groundswell necessary to pass the workplace policies we so desperately need. This is especially unfortunate, given that women are better off when we work outside the home: Working correlates with better mental and physical health, and working women not only report higher levels of happiness than women who don’t work, but the more hours women work, the happier we are (with the important exception of women who have very small children and work very long hours).",
		"25" : "Mothers who work are also good for families: Daughters of working mothers tend to be higher achieving, work themselves, make more money and spend more time with their children than do daughters of women who did not work; men who were raised by working mothers do more household work and help more with child care than sons of stay-at-home moms. And women’s presence in the workplace is good for women in the aggregate: Men who have stay-at-home wives are more likely than men with working wives to penalize their female co-workers, denying them promotions and viewing them unfavorably.",
		"26" : "Not working also puts women at risk. Without financial independence, we are more likely to get stuck in abusive or simply unhappy relationships. Although many women who take time off assume they can come back into the work force easily, even a few years off can have a lifelong impact on earnings.",
		"27" : "Lawmakers know all of this. They also know that refusing to provide paid parental leave, adequate sick days and affordable child care means women are routinely forced out of the workplace — women don’t choose to opt out, they’re pushed. Politicians make this choice and then claim it’s women who are free to do the choosing.",
		"28" : "Unlike my grandmother and my mother, I grew up with a steady whisper of “follow your dreams” in the background of my educational and career choices — the idea that a job was for both financial security and personal happiness. My own career also flourished atop a foundation of small but crucial benefits that were on offer to my family — low-interest loans under the G.I. Bill, which enabled the purchase of my mother’s childhood house, for example, generally weren’t given to African-American parents.",
		"29" : "And my expectations for career happiness also brought with them a different calculus for work and family: While I internalized the message that I should work for pay, and while I had the privilege of shaping a career that forms my identity and gives me purpose, I also entered my 30s acutely aware that these fragile personal victories could be upended by the ratcheted-up expectations of modern motherhood.",
		"30" : "Until I interviewed my own mother, I hadn’t thought about how her emphasis on finding happiness by chasing a passion was borne not only out of love for her kids but also from a childhood of observing its absence.",
		"31" : "“Grandma wrote songs,” my mom told me about her mother. “And most of her songs were love ballads — ‘I don’t care anymore, it doesn’t matter, though my heart may be breaking in two.’ Her songs were about heartbreak, and I didn’t realize that until I was older and I sat down and started reading the words. She never got to go any further. She didn’t have the time or the money or the ability to follow any of her dreams. She didn’t have the luck to have dreams.”"

		"1" : "He was only in his 30s when he came to power, defeating a sinister ultraright group that threatened to wreck France. Well read and intelligent, he had had the finest education France offered and made the best of it. He had high ambitions for the unity of Continental Europe and France’s foremost place in it, and looked upon a newly isolated Britain with scarcely concealed irritation bordering on contempt. He contemplated military action in Syria. He especially wanted to bring the tens of thousands of French exiles home from London to contribute once again to the life of the country, and promised nothing less than a popular revolution designed to “unblock France.”",
		"2" : "Both Emmanuel Macron and Napoleon Bonaparte fit this description perfectly, assuming that Mr. Macron beats Marine Le Pen of the National Front in the final round of the French elections on May 7, rather as Napoleon crushed the Bourbon royalists in the decade after their attempted coup in 1795. Even Ms. Le Pen’s attack on her opponent as someone who does not love France echoes the Bourbons’ portrayal of Napoleon as a Corsican outsider. Mr. Macron, whose En Marche! (Onward!) movement adopts a military metaphor so beloved by Napoleon, does not seem to mind the comparisons that are already being made.",
		"3" : "Of course the “democratic revolution” that Mr. Macron says he hopes will elect him is far removed from the military coup that propelled Napoleon to power in November 1799 and kept him there until 1815. But like Napoleon, Mr. Macron, who calls himself a pragmatic centrist, says he will transcend the left-right partisanship that has so bedeviled French politics over recent decades.",
		"4" : "Napoleon succeeded in “unblocking” France, with educational, legal, financial, religious and commercial reforms, many of which still exist. The Legion of Honor, Bank of France, Council of State, education system and much of Parisian architecture are Napoleonic constructs that testify to his genius 200 years later. Mr. Macron promises a similar boldness: “I do not propose to reform France; I propose to transform it at its deepest level,” he told this paper. But can his “democratic revolution” create any such enduring monuments?",
		"5" : "Mr. Macron was born in Amiens, the city where Napoleon sent his brother Joseph to negotiate peace between Britain and France in 1802. The treaty signed there lasted barely a year before hostilities broke out again, partly over the issue of the free-trading relationship with Europe that Napoleon would not allow Britain to enjoy, fearing its effect on French industry. The post-Brexit negotiations in which Mr. Macron will most likely play such an important part have long historical shadows. By the collapse of the Peace of Amiens in 1803, Napoleon had lured back from London almost all the French exiles who had fled during the revolution, in larger numbers than the tax exiles who fled the 75 percent top tax rate of President François Hollande, under whom Mr. Macron served as economics minister from 2014 to 2016.",
		"6" : "The panic around the rise of the National Front, which has brought Mr. Macron to the brink of victory, can partly be blamed on Charles de Gaulle. He institutionalized the extensive powers of the French presidency in 1958, with more than a nod to Napoleon’s dictatorship. Strong central government was thought to have worked for France and was visibly lacking in the Second, Third and Fourth Republics thereafter.",
		"7" : "De Gaulle also continued Napoleon’s system of voting in successive rounds, winnowing the number of contenders. De Gaulle assumed that this would ensure two centrist candidates of the left and right always got into the final round. But the eruption of Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002 and now his daughter Marine has exploded that complacent assumption, aided by the exposure of the sheer greed and graft of the center-right candidate François Fillon, who could otherwise have made it to the runoff in Ms. Le Pen’s place. How the shade of the general, the greatest Frenchman since Napoleon, must be regretting his calculations.",
		"8" : "The toxicity of modern French politics would hardly have surprised Napoleon, who survived almost as many assassination attempts as de Gaulle. But even today’s viciousness is as nothing if Mr. Macron does not win on May 7. A neo-fascist victory could well lead to an uprising in the suburban banlieues, which would recall the “événements” of 1848, 1871 and 1968, when protests turned to bloodshed.",
		"9" : "If he does win, Mr. Macron will inherit a sclerotic, underproducing, overtaxed, absurdly bureaucratic, highly partisan country with a huge security problem. Napoleon was able to cut through all of those same problems by manipulating public opinion through a controlled press, muscling through votes in a largely appointed Parliament and simply imposing diktats once he became emperor of France in 1804. He could do this because he differentiated between a “popular revolution” led dictatorially by him and a “democratic revolution” dependent upon free and fair elections.",
		"10" : "As a genuine democrat rather than simply posing as one, Mr. Macron will have no such luxury."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "For most of my career, the Republican Party was pretty easy to define. It stood for small government, an internationalist foreign policy, free trade, and moral and religious conservatism. Ronald Reagan was the party’s North Star. Of course, there have always been Republicans who veered from that line — but everyone understood what the party meant.",
		"2" : "Of all the people still trying to process Donald Trump’s rise to the presidency, perhaps none are more confused than my generation of conservatives, who came of age under Mr. Reagan and drank deeply of that old orthodoxy. We are, by now, the establishment — the senators, governors, think-tank presidents and columnists who, until Mr. Trump came along, got to define what “Republican” and “conservative” meant. My cohort simply cannot accept that Mr. Trump has taken away that coveted role and revolutionized not just our party, but also the very terms of the American political divide.",
		"3" : "But we need to. Because as Mr. Trump recognized, the new schism in American life is not about big versus small government, or more or less regulation. It is about immigration, free trade and the broad and deep impacts of globalization on America’s economy and culture. “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” he told the Republican National Convention.",
		"4" : "It is obvious to all but the most blinkered Republicans that with or without Mr. Trump, the Reagan era is over. The conservative-donor and think-tank consensus has been exploded. The next smart, ambitious young Republican politician with national aspirations will not adopt Ted Cruz’s strategy of trying to revive the rotting flesh of Reaganism. He will read out of Mr. Trump’s playbook, attacking globalism rather than big government. And he’ll win, because he’ll be talking about what worries voters.",
		"5" : "When William F. Buckley founded National Review in 1955, he argued that individual freedom needed to be protected from liberalism’s drift toward collectivism. Mr. Reagan’s vigorous anti-Communism put this into practice, as did his support of deregulation and tax cuts to promote economic freedom. My generation of conservatives inherited this framework.",
		"6" : "Over time, however, that iteration of Republican conservatism became less salient, in large part because it won. In 1989 we saw the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soon after, Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. Barack Obama bailed out Wall Street, promoted the further extension of free trade and was a cheerleader for Silicon Valley billionaires. By 2016, only a thoroughly catechized conservative believed Democrats were strangling economic freedom. Democrats have also assumed a large piece of the libertarian mantle, especially when it comes to sexuality and drugs.",
		"7" : "Meanwhile, the Republican Party stood still. True, the positions Mr. Buckley outlined over the years were supple enough, but their advocates were not: Their unthinking and increasingly ritualized loyalty to that phase of conservatism led the Republican establishment into political irrelevance, as Mr. Trump’s takeover of the party so brutally revealed. Given a clear, brash alternative, the Republican base tossed aside the orthodoxies of Reaganism.",
		"8" : "Most commentators struggle to explain Mr. Trump’s electoral success, because they assume he has no coherent political philosophy. This is myopic. As a public figure, Mr. Trump has articulated a consistent message that speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing the 21st-century West: We must affirm nationalism and fight globalism.",
		"9" : "This basic political message is dramatized by his populist rhetoric. At his campaign rallies he did not get cheers for denouncing government waste or championing tax cuts. His applause lines spoke of building a wall, deporting illegal immigrants, renegotiating trade deals and bringing back jobs. The America First, antiglobalist themes won him the election, not freedom-oriented, anti-government ones.",
		"10" : "I’m not surprised. Both parties — but not the average American voter — have been moving in a globalist direction for years. In his 2013 Inaugural Address, President Obama championed the qualities of innovation and mobility that will allow our nation to thrive in “this world without boundaries.” He was not proposing to eliminate passports, but he was expressing a sentiment that regards borders, limits and boundaries as necessary but regrettable, while openness and diversity are inherent goods.",
		"11" : "This way of thinking is everywhere, which makes it seem like common sense, rather than a political choice. Woodrow Wilson formulated Princeton’s informal motto: “Princeton in the nation’s service.” In 1996 it was extended to include “and in the service of all nations,” and then recently revised to read “Princeton in the nation’s service and the service of humanity.” Undoubtedly, administrators thought they were adapting to new global realities, rather than taking a controversial stance.",
		"12" : "The same goes for Stanford’s president, John Hennessy, who raised $750 million to fund a new program to gather “the world’s brightest minds” who can work “toward solving global challenges.” Isn’t this an admirable, sensible and responsible adaptation to the direction things are going?",
		"13" : "In contrast, Mr. Trump does not presume that the world must become flat. His Inaugural Address contrasted sharply with Mr. Obama’s 2013 speech. He spoke of renewing borders and solidarity, and called for national reconsolidation. This does not mean putting a stop to global trade or shutting down immigration, any more than Mr. Obama meant to bargain away American sovereignty or “destroy America,” as some conservative pundits insisted during his administration. But these two speeches, only four years apart, reflect a stark difference in emphasis. What Mr. Obama presented as a happy evolution Mr. Trump frames as something to be resisted. As he said in his recent address to the joint session of Congress: “My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.”",
		"14" : "Mr. Trump’s shocking success at the polls has done our country a service. Scholars may tut-tut about the historical connotations of “America First,” but the basic sentiment needs to be endorsed. Our country has dissolved to a far greater degree than those cloistered on the coasts allow themselves to realize. The once vast and unifying middle class has eroded over the last generation. Today we are increasingly divided into winners and losers. This division involves more than divergent economic prospects and income inequality. Globalism is an ideology of winners who stand astride our society as it is being remade by dramatic economic, demographic and cultural changes.",
		"15" : "Mitt Romney wrote off nearly half the American population as “takers.” Hillary Clinton made her notorious remarks about “deplorables.” These sentiments, widely shared by elites on the right and left, have become toxic. Caterpillar recently announced it is moving its corporate headquarters from Peoria, Ill., to Chicago. The unspoken reason? “C-suite level” talent bridles at relocating to flyover country. In today’s America, the rich, well-educated and globalized people on top, whether Republicans or Democrats, do not want to live among those who populate our country. The leaders increasingly hold them in disdain.",
		"16" : "After World War II, Mr. Buckley adopted an exaggerated approach to postwar American liberalism (which was hardly inclined toward socialism) because he thought the stakes were high. We face different dangers. In 2017, a growing economic divide and continuing cultural fragmentation, and even animosity, are grave threats that now define our politics. The Cold War is now domestic. Easy talk about the world becoming flat or global trade lifting all boats disguises, explains away and exacerbates the damage being done to the body politic. Mr. Trump’s stark juxtaposition of globalism and Americanism is crude and hyperbolic, but necessarily so.",
		"17" : "The generation of conservatives tutored by Mr. Buckley’s polemics against collectivism developed a healthy skepticism of big government. But they did not dismantle the modern welfare state; instead, they sought to limit its excesses and reduce long-term dependency. In the same spirit, rejecting globalism need not entail renouncing America’s role as leader of the international order or attacking global trade.",
		"18" : "Rather, we need to become much more skeptical of post-national ways of thinking. For too long a globalist utopianism — Mr. Obama’s happy, peaceful and inclusive world without boundaries — has tempted us to neglect one of the fundamental tasks of political leadership, which is to promote the kind of national solidarity that binds a country’s leaders to its people.",
		"19" : "Globalism poses a threat to the future of democracy because it disenfranchises the vast majority and empowers a technocratic elite. It’s a telling paradox that the most ardent supporters of a “borderless world” live in gated communities and channel their children toward a narrow set of elite educational institutions with stiff admissions standards that do the work of “border control.” The airport executive lounges are not open and inclusive.",
		"20" : "John Q. Public is not stupid. He senses that he no longer counts. And he resents the condescension of globalist elites, which is why Mr. Trump’s regular transgressions against elite-enforced political correctness evoke glee from his supporters.",
		"21" : "After Auschwitz, nationalism inevitably frightens many. I prefer to speak of patriotic solidarity, or a renewed national covenant. Whatever we call the antithesis to utopian globalism, it need not mean wholesale endorsement of Mr. Trump’s harshest rhetoric, which is often narrow and inarticulate. There’s a great deal more to our country than he allows, including traditions of secular and religious universalism that make the idealistic internationalism Mr. Obama sometimes articulated paradoxically very American. Nevertheless, we’ve tilted too strongly in the globalist direction. In our divided country, conservatism — and liberalism as well — needs to lean in the direction of nationalism.",
		"22" : "For many in the conservative camp, this seems unnecessary, even irresponsible. They think Mr. Trump has betrayed the movement Mr. Buckley shaped. We need to remember, however, that the Cold War gave drama and relevance to Mr. Buckley’s way of framing our fundamental political commitments. But the Soviet Union collapsed a generation ago. Our commitments must be made against a different horizon."

		"5" : "At Camp Base No. 1 he keeps several suitcases containing his art — drawings and sketches, many of ships, skylines and local musicians, done on paper, cardboard, Masonite and wood — in addition to a few woodworking projects and an L.L. Bean windup radio on which he listens to NPR at night. He also has coffee and a hand-crank coffee grinder, which he is looking forward to using again when he’s back in a setup with a hot plate. At the moment, his kitchen facilities consist of a blue plastic cooler that on a recent afternoon held a bag of ice, cranberry juice and some leftover Greek food.",
		"6" : "“I’m the Igloo guy, compressed into a small area,” Mr. McGill said as he moved a few of the landlord’s many plastic storage crates to reveal his sleeping area: a narrow mattress with a sleeping bag.",
		"7" : "As for bathroom facilities, Mr. McGill said he has “arrangements — locally, I’m always close to places where I can take a shower, use the bathroom, friends’ places.”",
		"8" : "When it comes to housing, the barter system does not always yield even results, and the places where Mr. McGill has lived over the past few years have ranged from downright charming to rather primitive.",
		"9" : "He has stayed, for example, in an atmospheric old longshoreman’s house in Red Hook, a former coffin factory in Bushwick and the master bedroom of a Sea Gate mansion that was later destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, in Brooklyn; his friend, who was renting the house, preferred to sleep on the couch. “That was a great camp,” Mr. McGill said fondly, describing how he fell asleep at night to the sound of waves crashing on the beach. But he has also slept in many a basement, a hammock in a heated Staten Island garage and, for several months in the mid-aughts, on top of a nonworking elevator shaft.",
		"10" : "For a few weeks in 2015, he slept on a Murphy bed in the home of a family living on Pioneer Street in Red Hook, while he taught their 7-year-old son how to dig holes for pylons to support a new back deck. They found bottles of mineral water from the 19th century, marbles from the 1920s and a Mercury dime, which they organized into an informal archaeological museum.",
		"11" : "Not infrequently, Mr. McGill also stays in a Hell’s Kitchen walk-up where his ex-wife lives, when he is renovating the apartment downstairs that one of the couple’s two daughters inherited from the ex-wife’s brother.",
		"12" : "“I’m allowed to stay there if I’m working on something. And when I stay there, I can count on a comfortable night with TV and blankets and Pantene hair spray,” he said with a theatrical flourish about his head.",
		"13" : "Even before adopting his current way of life, Mr. McGill said, he has never liked to stay in one place for long. He moved to New York from Dublin in 1982. He came as a student, researching environmental construction practices, but he had to pay the rent — his apartment on Avenue B cost $285 a month — so he started working.",
		"14" : "But by the time he lost his wood shop in Red Hook, for which he paid $1,100 a month, he had soured on the arrangement and rents had risen so high that they precluded living alone.",
		"15" : "Fortunately, many of his friends in Red Hook own older buildings that often need repairs. Many also own bars in those buildings, on whose walls he stages his art shows; he has one now at Verona Wine Bar on Van Brunt Street. He also barters for food and wine, he said. If it’s good.",
		"16" : "“I don’t want to live with five people and their bedbugs,” Mr. McGill said. “I’ve built a lot of bars around here, done work on a lot of places. It’s a good village I’ve got. You just have to have the ability to adapt to each situation.”",
		"17" : "As for whether he ever gets nervous about finding the next place to stay, Mr. McGill insisted that he doesn’t. “You know there’s always going to be another leak somewhere,” he said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The living room floor slopes in Laura Osnes’s fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper West Side, baffling Lyla, the resident Chihuahua, making guests question their alcohol intake and necessitating the removal of the rolling desk chair.",
		"2" : "The kitchen is of a size that invites unfavorable comparisons to a postage stamp, and the dishwasher is 35 years old (that would be Ms. Osnes’s husband, Nathan Johnson). But there is a deck, high ceilings and exposed brick — and thanks to the five-flight climb, absolutely no need to join a gym. It’s all very “Barefoot in the Park,” an association that delights the apartment’s occupants, who, while approaching their 10th anniversary, seem as much like newlyweds as the characters in that Neil Simon play.",
		"3" : "“We’re very happy here,” said Ms. Osnes, 31, a two-time Tony Award nominee (for the musicals “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella”) and a star of the Broadway musical “Bandstand,” which opened April 26.",
		"4" : "When Ms. Osnes triumphed in a reality show talent competition and won the lead in the 2007 Broadway revival of the musical “Grease,” the prize didn’t include help in smoothing the way from her home in Eagan, Minn., to the mean streets of Manhattan. “It was like, ‘See you in New York for your first rehearsal,’” recalled Ms. Osnes, who was knee-deep in wedding plans at the time.",
		"5" : "She and Mr. Johnson, an actor turned photographer, came east to scout the territory and found a one-bedroom on the 31st floor of the Orion, a shiny new high-rise condominium near Times Square. The unit’s owner was offering a year’s lease, and the newlyweds grabbed it, lured by the view, the unsullied surfaces and the location.",
		"6" : "“It was super close to the theater I’d be working at,” Ms. Osnes said. “There were laundry facilities a floor away, and a doorman. And they served continental breakfast. Moving here with a job and a brand-new husband and a great apartment set us off on the right foot.”",
		"7" : "But after a year, the couple wanted to see some trees and save some money, and it so happened that a cast mate from “Grease” was vacating her one-bedroom rental and looking for someone to take over the lease. Ms. Osnes and Mr. Johnson were willing and eager.",
		"8" : "“We were ready for a change. We were ready for the New York experience,” said Ms. Osnes, who wasn’t sure initially just how much of that New York experience she really wanted. “When we lived in the high-rise and I went to visit friends in walk-ups, I thought to myself, ‘I will never do this. Why would anyone live like this?’ And then, a year later, I found myself living in a five-flight walk-up. It’s funny how your attitudes change the longer you live here.”",
		"9" : "Ms. Osnes and Mr. Johnson exude a sunny optimism, a can-do and make-do spirit. Faced with less than meager work space in the kitchen — and both avid cooks — they installed a tiny drop-down wood counter in the living room.",
		"10" : "Eight for Thanksgiving? Easy.",
		"11" : "And with little wall space to hang show posters and a certain disinclination to bring her work home, Ms. Osnes went with show magnets instead. They’re neatly lined up on the refrigerator door.",
		"12" : "The apartment is furnished mostly with pieces the couple had on their wedding registry and hauled to New York from Minnesota. They’ve since replaced the sofa and bought an accent chair, both gray, as well as an off-white rug, and they recently hired Mike Harrison, an interior designer, to add some polish.",
		"13" : "Mr. Harrison successfully pushed for more throw pillows on the sofa, painted an accent wall colonial blue, hung a round mirror on the brick wall to give the living room more depth, and moved around a few pieces of art. But he knew better than to mess with the liquor cabinet, which is the domain of Mr. Johnson (his wife drinks nothing stronger than tea).",
		"14" : "Mr. Harrison also stayed away from the wall unit, which holds Ms. Osnes’s very special property: 10 binders of Playbills (arranged chronologically, starting with the “Man of La Mancha” Broadway revival she saw during a trip to New York as a high school student in 2003) and a selection of board games, including Yahtzee, Life, Sorry, Scrabble and Clue. Be warned: Ms. Osnes takes her Scrabble very, very seriously.",
		"15" : "“Laura is incredibly talented at it, but she doesn’t want to brag,” Mr. Johnson said, adding, “I no longer play Clue with her; I know what the outcome is going to be.”",
		"16" : "As soon as the weather turns fine, the fun and games move to the deck. Early on, the couple had it resurfaced and bought a grill. Now, a favorite handmade rug from the Citizenry, a home goods website, has come outdoors for the season.",
		"17" : "“Even though other people around us have decks, it still feels really private,” Ms. Osnes said. “We love having friends over, and when Nate grills, our place becomes a real hang.”",
		"18" : "Because they live on the top floor, it is sometimes easy for Ms. Osnes to forget the building has other occupants, so she might just burst into song.",
		"19" : "“Sometimes I’ll see people in the hall and they’ll say, ‘Oh, we heard you singing yesterday,’” Ms. Osnes said. ‘And I’m like, ‘I am so sorry.’ And they’re always very nice and say, ‘No, we love it.’”",
		"20" : "Of course they love it. Who wouldn’t?"

		"1" : "When Nicole Silver wants to book a yoga class in her new apartment building or notify the doorman that her cousin is staying over while she jets off to Thailand, she does not make a phone call, send an email, or leave a note.",
		"2" : "She just opens up an app on her phone. In seconds, she is done.",
		"3" : "“It’s the first app that actually makes a difference in my life,” said Ms. Silver, a 28-year-old Manhattan lawyer. “It makes everything seamless.”",
		"4" : "Ms. Silver is just one of many residents in high-end buildings now getting the app treatment. Living at 7 West 21st Street, an 18-story Flatiron rental building replete with the accouterments of modern luxury living — including a fitness center, golf simulator and rooftop garden — she was surprised to learn that the building came with a new perk: a customized app, courtesy of the developer, Rose Associates.",
		"5" : "While smartphones are ubiquitous and their apps are de rigueur for daily living, developers only recently embraced them. Rose first tested its app last year. Like versions being rolled out by Brookfield Properties, Extell Development and JDS Development, the Rose app offers easier access to the amenities that entice renters to pay more than $4,000 a month for a studio.",
		"6" : "The typical app allows the resident, with an easy swipe and tap, to complete tasks like paying the rent, booking fitness classes, arranging dry cleaning, reserving common areas for parties, receiving package notifications or telling the resident manager that you need your stove fixed. The Rose app offers discounts for neighborhood businesses looking to promote themselves.",
		"7" : "“Some of it is as basic as: ‘How do I reserve things? I want to have friends over for a barbecue on Saturday night. How do I know I can reserve the barbecue?’” said J. Brian Peters, Rose’s chief operating officer.",
		"8" : "At 555 10th Avenue, a new Hudson Yards development, a residential app is a “very important aspect” of the building, said Laura Kirschbaum, the vice president for development at Extell.",
		"9" : "“We’re seeing a tremendous amount of engagement,” Ms. Kirschbaum said. Ninety-three percent of residents pay their rent through the app, for example, she said, adding, “We’re doing everything through apps.”",
		"10" : "Residential apps are flourishing as the luxury market, particularly in Manhattan, cools off. With prices plateauing and demand slackening, developers and building managers are turning to new toys to lure prospective tenants.",
		"11" : "Suddenly, steep prices need to justify themselves, and a rooftop garden is not enough.",
		"12" : "“This notion of buildings developing apps to communicate with their tenants and make it more convenient is a great example of how buildings and developers are thinking creatively about alternative concessions and incentives,” said Lauren Riefflin, a senior manager for marketing and communications at StreetEasy, the listings website. “It’s a product of a changing competitive landscape in the luxury market.”",
		"13" : "App developers see an opportunity. Francesca Loftus is a creator of hOM, an app used by a number of developers, including Rose, AvalonBay, Brookfield and Kushner Real Estate, the company inherited by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law.",
		"14" : "HOM functions somewhat like GoFundMe, allowing residents to propose and rank programming in their buildings. Residents chip in money through their phones and staff members from hOM run events. The app can connect to the calendar in a user’s smartphone to determine the best time for that building-wide Pilates class penciled in for next Thursday.",
		"15" : "“The buildings that really understood the value at the outset were luxury rental buildings,” Ms. Loftus said. Now, smaller buildings without the same amenities — a doorman or gym — are trying to get in on the act. “If you can get $2,000 a month on a 300-square-foot studio and also have some sort of community element, it’s such a win, such a competitive advantage.”",
		"16" : "For the residents who are living the app life, there is no going back.",
		"17" : "“It’s one of those things you overlook when you move into an apartment building. How are packages delivered? How are groceries handled?” said Michael Gleicher, 30, who lives at 7 West 21st Street. “Life is so much easier now.”"

Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.",

		"6" : "Even though some buyers are taking their time in sorting through this oversupply, they are still willing to sign contracts. And prices are generally stable, though with some exceptions.",
		"7" : "Apartments priced in the $1 million to $3 million range may prompt a bidding war, but most homes $5 million and under are selling well. Many offerings over $10 million have been discounted already, and some can be negotiated down as much as 30 percent more, brokers say.",
		"8" : "The market was off to a good start this year. There were 330 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2017, a 33 percent increase from the same period last year, according to a report from Olshan Realty Inc., which tracks sales in this price range. This is evidence that buyers are pulling the trigger, even if they are taking their time about it.",

		"10" : "To introduce the sale of an $11.75 million, four-bedroom penthouse in Midtown, Tara King-Brown and Amy Williamson, two associate brokers from the Corcoran Group, ditched the evening cocktail party, the industry’s tried-and-tested event, and instead held a morning meditation class in the building’s common-area yoga room.",
		"11" : "About a dozen people, mostly brokers, attended the class, which was run by MNDFL, a firm that runs several meditation studios throughout the city. After a 30-minute session of deep breathing and reflection as the sun rose over the East River, the group got a tour of the penthouse at 305 East 51st Street.",
		"12" : "“What’s fantastic about this place is the view and morning light so we wanted the brokers to feel it for themselves,” Ms. King-Brown said. “Hosting a different type of networking event is necessary to stand out, especially since buyers have so much to choose from.”",
		"13" : "To draw attention to a $6.995 million, four-bedroom condo at 6 Cortlandt Alley, Susan Wires, a Stribling saleswoman, held a continuing education class run by the firm TitleVest called “Condominium Essentials” for agents and brokers in the residence. She said it helped “get a lot of eyes on this building since we’re a small, new development, not a large tower that gets a lot of attention.”",
		"14" : "Fredrik Eklund, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman and a cast member of the television show “Million Dollar Listing New York,” recently invited 55 so-called Instagram influencers, or those with the most followers in the city, to a four-bedroom, $20.75 million home at Madison Square Park Tower.",
		"15" : "Ripping a page out of fashion marketing, where social media stars are invited to post photos and comment on designer wear and store openings, Mr. Eklund allowed the group to post photos from the apartment on the 56th floor. He admitted that the move was a little risky, since he didn’t check to see what everyone was posting.",
		"16" : "“But if you’re an Instagram influencer, you’re creative, a good photographer,” so you’re guaranteed a good shot, he said. “They were happy to have access to an apartment with a gorgeous view, plus I reached a non-real-estate audience.”",
		"17" : "The event generated more than 100 postings on the building, eliciting over 150,000 interactions (likes, comments, views) and reached over five million Instagram users who follow the invited social media influencers. The building’s own Instagram page immediately signed up about 1,000 new followers after the event, now totaling about 14,600.",
		"18" : "Mr. Eklund said a Chinese fashion designer who was in town in February for fashion week made an appointment to see an apartment after the Instagram blitz. He said many younger buyers check information on a property through social media even before looking at the building’s website.",
		"19" : "Many developers and brokers like to turn a model showroom or listing into a temporary art gallery and give parties, an easy guest list to compile because buyers of high-end art and real estate tend to overlap.",
		"20" : "Vickey Barron, a broker at Douglas Elliman, said she prefers smaller get-togethers. To drive attention to a Chelsea condominium building, she organized a small breakfast with the developer and several brokers.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The tale of the lease buyout is almost mythical in New York.",
		"2" : "It goes something like this: A tenant with the good fortune of a rent-regulated apartment in a hot neighborhood negotiates a six- or even seven-figure payout in exchange for the keys. On the surface, a buyout may look like a sweetheart deal for a tenant. But tenant advocates say the reality is often dark, with landlords preying on vulnerable tenants and bullying people into leaving their homes for paltry sums.",
		"3" : "Even under the darkest circumstances, though, plenty of landlords still cut the checks. But what happens if they don’t?",
		"4" : "On Jan. 31 of this year, Machiveni Tigrai moved out of his rent-regulated, $1,720-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, expecting to receive a $260,000 buyout. He piled his belongings into a U-Haul and handed in the keys. But his landlord did not give him the money. Instead, when he called, he just got voice mail and silence.",
		"5" : "So Mr. Tigrai, 37, who works in technology, slept in his U-Haul in the middle of winter, afraid to leave his belongings unattended. As the days wore on, he became increasingly anxious. He did not want to sign a lease on a new apartment until he had the check in hand, and he did not want to pay for storage. So he stayed with the truck, some nights sleeping on friends’ couches. “You’re always kind of anxious with a deal of this magnitude,” he said.",
		"6" : "As it turned out, Mr. Tigrai had good reason to worry. His landlord, Raphael Toledano, failed to pay 15 tenants their promised buyouts as his fledgling real estate empire, Brookhill Properties, faltered.",
		"7" : "“He pulled the rug out from under them,” said SaMi Chester, a housing organizer at Cooper Square Committee, an advocacy group that represents tenants in properties Mr. Toledano owns in the East Village.",
		"8" : "Over the last three years, Mr. Toledano, 27, acquired around 30 Manhattan rental properties and a notorious reputation. He bought a portfolio of 15 buildings, including Mr. Tigrai’s building on East 12th Street, from the Tabak family for $97 million in 2015. He financed the deal with a $124 million loan from Madison Realty Capital, a real estate investor, planning to use the extra money for buyouts and renovations.",
		"9" : "What followed was a familiar playbook: Coerce tenants to give up their valuable rent-regulated apartments with threats of eviction or offers of cash payouts, or both. Once the tenants leave, renovate the empty spaces and lease them for considerably more money. “At the end of the day, it’s a part of the business plan,” Mr. Toledano said in a telephone interview.",
		"10" : "But that business plan became a nightmare for some of his tenants. Last year, tenants in a building Mr. Toledano owns on East 13th Street settled a harassment suit against him after they secretly recorded his agent making threatening statements. Mr. Tigrai said that to persuade him, Mr. Toledano called him six or seven times a day, from different numbers, a violation of a city tenant harassment law.",
		"11" : "“He made it really clear that he was going to make it a miserable place to live,” said Jen Bekman, 47, an entrepreneur who lives in another Toledano-owned building, on East Fifth Street. She also fielded daily calls and texts from the landlord. “Sometimes he’d lose his temper. You could just tell that he was kind of volatile.”",
		"12" : "The clock was ticking for Mr. Toledano. His deal with Madison Realty Capital gave him a year to clear out apartments, then renovate and rent them.",
		"13" : "“He really came in with the idea that he was going to be able to empty out that whole portfolio and people were going to roll over,” Mr. Chester, the housing advocate, said.",
		"14" : "As time went on, the buyout offers grew. In June 2016, Ms. Bekman, who had lived in her $1,900-a-month one-bedroom apartment for 25 years, signed a deal for $600,000, the largest payout any of the tenants were offered. In all, 140 of the 300 tenants who lived in the 15 buildings signed buyout agreements, totaling $7 million in payouts, Mr. Toledano said.",
		"15" : "By last spring, Mr. Tigrai, who had lived in his apartment for almost a decade, was worried a window would close. “I felt like this guy is throwing a lot of money around,” he said. “I don’t want to be the last guy to take the deal.”",
		"16" : "But by the time Mr. Tigrai and Ms. Bekman signed agreements to give up their apartments, Mr. Toledano was unable to pay his debts. To shield himself from personal liability, Mr. Toledano had purchased each of his properties using limited liability companies. Last summer, the L.L.C.s that owned the buildings in the Madison Realty portfolio went into default and Madison stopped funding the buyouts.",
		"17" : "“He wasn’t able to renovate the properties as quickly as he expected,” said Brian Shatz, a managing principal of Madison Realty. He “wasn’t able to implement the business plan.”",
		"18" : "In early February of this year, just days after Mr. Tigrai moved out, Madison Realty filed for foreclosure on the properties. About two weeks later, Mr. Tigrai received an email from Brookhill Properties: The company did not have the money to pay him.",
		"19" : "Realizing that he had lost his home and anticipated nest egg, Mr. Tigrai hired a lawyer, James B. Fishman. “I think what happened here is pretty outrageous,” Mr. Fishman said.",
		"20" : "On March 6, a judge ordered Mr. Tigrai back into his apartment, restoring his lease until the case is resolved. He came back to an apartment that still had stains on the ceiling from years of water damage. A few days after he moved back in, he discovered large holes that had been cut in the wood floors without warning. The management told him it had needed to access pipes to repair leaks in another apartment, he said.",
		"21" : "Ms. Bekman, meanwhile, received $50,000 after she signed her buyout. But the next $100,000 installment never arrived, so she stopped packing, and is still living in her apartment. She no longer pays rent, in keeping with the terms of the deal with Mr. Toledano. “I have a free apartment in New York; I’m living in one of these folklore tales,” she said. “But I’ve felt like I’m moving in 30 days for more than a year now.”",
		"22" : "Ms. Bekman worries that she might never get the rest of her money, and might lose the apartment, too. “I have nerves of steel,” she said. “But this is scary.”",
		"23" : "Mr. Chester said that Mr. Toledano’s tactics were no different from those of other landlords hoping to make a quick profit. But being able to return to an apartment in light of a failed buyout usually happens only when the tenant has “good legal representation and good organizing.”",
		"24" : "Even Madison Realty, which decided to lend a huge sum to a young, inexperienced landlord, does not see Mr. Toledano as an outlier. “As much as I’d like to tell you that Raphael Toledano destroyed this portfolio or mismanaged it completely,” Mr. Shatz said, “there are a lot of other landlords that are at this level that are operating and running buildings exactly like this.”",
		"25" : "Mr. Toledano insisted that he never intended to violate the agreements of tenants. “Are they upset, are they frustrated?” he said. “Yes, I can understand. I’m a businessman, I do business deals, very large ones. I feel their pain. I’m sincerely apologetic. It was ultimately a result of something much larger than I was able to handle.”",
		"26" : "In late March, the L.L.C.s that owned the properties filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, halting the foreclosure. At an April 14 hearing, a judge gave Madison Realty’s management company, Silverstone Property Group, the temporary authority to operate the properties, to collect rent and make repairs. “Now the tenants will have some clarity about who their management is,” said Mr. Shatz of Madison Realty.",
		"27" : "For the 15 tenants waiting for their buyout payments, the future is uncertain. Mr. Shatz was circumspect, saying, “Our general intention is to honor those obligations.”",
		"28" : "Mr. Toledano, meanwhile, has been selling off other East Village properties and said he was in contract with an investor to buy a $200 million portfolio of properties in the West Village, a neighborhood where he said tenants were less organized.",
		"29" : "“I kind of want to get out of the East Village walk-up business, to be honest,” he said, without a hint of remorse. “There is so much scrutiny of the buyouts.”"

And while Minnesota may offer the best health care — and a quality of life second only to that in New York — it is also very expensive.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "When my boyfriend, Mike DiPasquale, asked me to move in with him after two years of dating, I was thrilled. Even though I wasn’t sure exactly what I was signing up for.",
		"2" : "Just the prospect of no longer needing to keep two bottles of contact lens solution, two toothbrushes and two sticks of deodorant in two separate homes was enough to have me jumping for joy. Visions of plush rugs, soft lighting and cuddling in front of a fireplace filled my head.",
		"3" : "I quickly realized that I was confusing coffee commercials with real life. The truth is: Living together before you’re married is a big step legally, financially and emotionally.",
		"4" : "Friends and family didn’t give me much practical advice before I moved into Mike’s condo, a third-floor studio inside a former South Philadelphia Catholic elementary school. His mother attended school here in the early 1960s; we boil pasta, play video games and take showers in what was once her seventh-grade classroom.",
		"5" : "My mother gave us a $100 gift certificate to Crate and Barrel, but she didn’t tell me what to anticipate.",
		"6" : "I Googled “Moving in with your boyfriend,” but the search results landed with a thud. The advice was dry and didn’t speak to my concerns: How do I know if I’m picking a compatible person to move in with? What if he’s annoyed by my hourlong phone calls with my sister, the sweatpants I wear around the house, or the insane amount of hair I shed on every available surface?",
		"7" : "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans than ever are choosing to live together before marriage. And the Pew Research Center says more than half of all women aged 19 to 44 who marry for the first time have lived with their husbands before walking down the aisle. Unmarried millennials are more likely to live with their partners than any previous generation at this stage in their lives.",
		"8" : "It’s clear why couples find cohabitation so appealing. Aside from the convenience it affords, the prospect of splitting rent and utility bills is too seductive to pass up. Add in a desire to shed roommates and a reluctance to renew a pricey lease, and you can see why plenty of couples choose cohabitation, even if they aren’t exactly sure what comes next.",
		"9" : "I was so focused on the elation of moving in with Mike that I didn’t even consider what would happen if our relationship went down in flames. We had never discussed who would stay in the condo, who would take possession of the Passat we leased together, or which one of us would get to keep our three-legged cat, Eleanor.",
		"10" : "Turns out we’re not alone. Most couples don’t take the time to walk through the financial and legal implications of cohabitation beforehand. According to leading legal and financial experts, that’s a major mistake and a missed opportunity.",
		"11" : "Frederick Hertz, author of “Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples,” says the first step toward moving in together is to figure out what will happen should you part ways: “You can either plan your breakup in a civilized, caring, thoughtful way, or you can try to avoid it and have it be a nasty fight later on.”",
		"12" : "If you are renting or own a home, figure out who will stay in the event of a breakup. Nail down who will pay any pesky fees or taxes. Come up with a plan.",
		"13" : "In light of this practical advice, I pushed Mike to discuss what would happen if we should break up.",
		"14" : "Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the possibility. He said he’d be so devastated that he would start a new life from scratch. While I appreciated the drama of his response, we still needed to develop a road map.",
		"15" : "Since Mike had owned his condo before we started dating, we agreed he should continue to live in it. I volunteered to move in with my parents until I found a more permanent place. I’d keep the Passat and pay the remaining payments on the lease. And Eleanor would stay with me. (I was thrilled I could keep the cat, but I didn’t want to cheer too loudly.)",
		"16" : "After we settled on the details of our dissolution, we gave each other a long hug.",
		"17" : "Pam Friedman, a marital financial expert and author of “I Now Pronounce You Financially Fit,” agrees that the biggest mistake couples make is moving in together before having these candid talks. She advises couples to be honest about their fears and insecurities and meet them head on: What happens if we break up? Or get sick? Or die?",
		"18" : "Some unmarried couples might benefit from a cohabitation agreement, also known as a no-nup, a legal agreement about who gets what in the event of a breakup or major life event.",
		"19" : "“You’ve got to think five steps ahead,” Ms. Friedman said. “And it’s no fun at first. Then it becomes a project you can work on together.”",
		"20" : "Apart from thorny financial and legal concerns, cohabitation creates a new set of emotional constraints for couples as well.",
		"21" : "Galena Rhoades, a professor and researcher who studies cohabitation at the University of Denver, calls it a “sandwich period,” when people juggle dating and marriage issues concurrently.",
		"22" : "“When you live together,” Dr. Rhoades explained, “you face all the issues dating couples face — time together, managing friends, jealousy, ex-partners — but you also face all the issues married couples face, like household contributions, managing money together and planning for future expenditures.”",
		"23" : "It can be an especially risky undertaking if the couple immediately goes from a long-distance relationship to cohabitation. Katie Leggett and Allen Hotchkiss did just that. The couple dated for over a year while Ms. Leggett lived in the West Village and Mr. Hotchkiss lived in Chicago. Then they moved into an apartment together in Park Slope, Brooklyn.",
		"24" : "“We knew we could get more bang for our buck if we just took the plunge and moved in together when my lease was up, versus getting separate studios, or dealing with roommates for another year in our late 20s,” Ms. Leggett said. “It was definitely an adjustment.”",
		"25" : "“There were very few surprises upon moving in with each other,” Mr. Hotchkiss recalled. “Talking about all of the possible ‘what if’ scenarios is the only way to make sure living together is the right move.”",
		"26" : "A self-confessed Type A germophobe, Ms. Leggett follows a strict set of rules: No shoes in the house and no clothes that have been worn on the subways on the bed. She showers twice a day.",
		"27" : "Mr. Hotchkiss is more laid back. “For me, it was about picking the right battles and respecting Katie’s key points of contention, like taking my shoes off at the door or not wearing my ‘subway clothes’ on the bed,” Mr. Hotchkiss said. This willingness to meet in the middle eased the transition considerably.",
		"28" : "Mike and I slid into certain habits when it came to chores. I’m happiest food shopping, cooking meals and emptying the dishwasher. Mike prefers washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making the bed and taking out the trash.",
		"29" : "The key, says Jolie Kerr, Esquire’s cleaning advice columnist and host of the podcast “Ask a Clean Person,” is to treat each other as teammates rather than adversaries: “You play to each other’s strengths.”",
		"30" : "We were happy to assign chores based on whoever expressed more enthusiasm. However it quickly became evident that our cleanliness standards are wildly different.",
		"31" : "Mike can spot a sesame seed five yards away, and he folds his T-shirts into precise, flat squares. I leave a trail of crumbs in my wake, and my clothes are not so much folded as herded into a vague rectangle. We had to adjust our standards. I’m learning to sweep up my errant crumbs, and he’s learning to live with a little chaos.",
		"32" : "And I knew Mike detested clutter, but we didn’t have any discussions about how we would adjust his 874-square-foot space to fit both our physical needs. Apparently, this lack of conversation around design is also very common.",
		"33" : "Sheena Murphy, a founder and designer at a Brooklyn-based design studio called Sheep and Stone, encourages partners to be explicit about their expectations and boundaries: “One of the biggest things people don’t do is talk about living together, what that means and how you’re going to set up your home.”",
		"34" : "After a year of dating, Armando Morales and Annie Simeone decided it was silly for them both to be paying New York City rents, especially since hers was twice what he paid. Last June they figured they could make it work in Mr. Morales’s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, pending a drastic reworking of the space.",
		"35" : "Fortunately, Ms. Simeone works as a production designer for film and television. She created a rendering of the apartment and its furniture layout using a three-dimensional modeling program, which allowed her to envision various floor plans. Mr. Morales crafted custom shelving so they could save even more space.",
		"36" : "“We have a classic New York railroad, with a kitchen on one end and the bedroom on the other. In between is an office and a living room,” Mr. Morales said. “It’s perfect for a couple in that you can be together but also have separate space when you need it.”",
		"37" : "Another reason couples choose to cohabitate is to spend more time together. It’s been interesting to see how Mike and I use that time.",
		"38" : "Like most modern couples, we are never far away from our cellphones. We’re quick to browse social media at the slightest lull in conversation. I prefer to scroll through Facebook while he’s more of a Twitter guy. Over time, I sensed that our willingness to plug in (and ignore each other) was affecting the quality of our interactions.",
		"39" : "Christine Carter, author of “The Sweet Spot” and “Raising Happiness,” sees this play out in plenty of couples. She recommends setting ground rules for technology usage and minimizing double-screen time, as she calls it.",
		"40" : "If you’re doing something mindless with your partner, like watching TV, just focus on that. Don’t also check your work email, play Candy Crush or do anything else to draw your attention away from each other.",
		"41" : "“Your partner can be a source of deep and lasting joy, connection, meaning, fulfillment,” Dr. Carter said. “Your phone cannot.”",
		"42" : "In the end, some of my initial concerns proved silly. Mike doesn’t mind that I shed like Mr. Snuffleupagus in August. When I conduct marathon phone calls with my sister, he catches up on his social media apps. He’s happy to scrub the toilet, as long as I clean the shower.",
		"43" : "We are stronger for taking this step and navigating our sandwich phase — this premarriage, postdating bubble — with clear eyes.",
		"44" : "Having those difficult talks about our finances and being more mindful of the space we share, the chores we perform and the habits we cultivate, we’re well on our way to creating a happy home.",
		"45" : "After living together for two years — and after countless loads of laundry and a dizzying number of dishwasher cycles — Mike and I tied the knot on April 21, 2017. Eleanor is thrilled."

		"1" : "Dr. Joseph E. Lifschutz, a psychiatrist who spent a weekend in jail in 1969 defending his contention that a legal privilege of confidentiality should be extended to psychotherapists, a position later affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, died on April 15 in Alamo, Calif. He was 92.",
		"2" : "His death was confirmed by his grandson Andy Lifschutz.",
		"3" : "Dr. Lifschutz, a Brooklyn native, landed in a Northern California jail amid a lawsuit in which a high school physics teacher was suing a student who had cracked his jaw.",
		"4" : "Though the teacher publicly acknowledged that he had been Dr. Lifschutz’s patient, Dr. Lifschutz refused to divulge his notes or even to confirm that he had ever treated the man.",
		"5" : "His principled stand eventually established a legal precedent and influenced a Supreme Court decision asserting that the right of confidentiality that applies to lawyers, clergy members and married couples also extends to psychotherapists.",
		"6" : "His case “was the first to assert clearly and formally that a constitutional right to privacy includes a psychotherapist-patient privilege,” Robert G. Meyer and Christopher M. Weaver wrote in “Law and Mental Health: A Case-Based Approach” (2006).",
		"7" : "Dr. Saul Levin, chief executive and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association, called confidentiality one of the most important principles in medicine.",
		"8" : "“I applaud Dr. Lifschutz for going to such great lengths for his patient, even at the risk of his own freedom,” Dr. Levin wrote in an email.",
		"9" : "Technically, Dr. Lifschutz lost his case: The courts ruled that therapists, unlike priests, were not covered by an absolute privilege; that confidentiality was accorded to the patient, not the doctor; and that the disparate treatment of priests and therapists by the judicial system did not deny him equal protection under the law.",
		"10" : "Still, the California courts recognized the necessity of confidentiality and set limits on how much a doctor had to disclose, even in cases in which a patient appeared to have waived a right to privacy by claiming mental or emotional stress.",
		"11" : "“For the proper practice of psychotherapy, a patient has to open his mind as completely as humanly possible,” Dr. Lifschutz told The New York Times after his weekend in jail. “He must have absolute assurance that what he says will have total confidentiality.”",
		"12" : "In 1996, Dr. Lifschutz sat through the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in a subsequent doctor-patient privilege case, Jaffee v. Redmond. In that case, the court ruled that federal judges must allow mental health professionals to refuse to disclose patient records in civil and criminal proceedings. Their ruling cited the Lifschutz case.",
		"13" : "“Was it harder for the U.S. Supreme Court justices to dismiss the importance of confidentiality in psychotherapy while in the presence of someone who had gone to jail for it?” Bram Fridhandler, a California psychologist, wrote in 2005 in The San Francisco Psychologist. “We can only speculate. But we know that their decision has become the single most influential legal statement of the need for confidentiality to support effective psychotherapy, which they describe as a transcendent value for society.”",
		"14" : "Joseph Emanuel Lifschutz was born in Brooklyn on April 30, 1924, to Oscar Lifschutz, who ran a grocery in the Williamsburg neighborhood, and the former Miriam Schor, both of them immigrants from Europe.",
		"15" : "A graduate of Boys High School, he attended City College, Brooklyn College and the University of Oregon before serving in the Army in World War II. He completed his college studies after his military service, graduating with a bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1945. He then earned a medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco.",
		"16" : "During the Korean War, as an Army medical corps captain, he began seeing psychiatric patients at Madigan Army Hospital in Tacoma, Wash.",
		"17" : "His marriages to Barbara Welch and Ellen St. Sure ended in divorce. He is survived by his longtime companion, Jean Neihaus; three children from his first marriage, Yolanda Gamble and Nathan and Thomas Lifschutz; a sister, Rita Wroblewski; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. Another son from his first marriage, Mark, died.",
		"18" : "Dr. Lifschutz’s involvement in the confidentiality issue began in the late 1950s, when he opened his practice in Orinda, a San Francisco suburb. Among his first patients was Joseph F. Housek, a teacher at Burlingame High School in San Mateo County.",
		"19" : "Ten years later, in 1969, Dr. Lifschutz received a subpoena to testify in a Superior Court suit that Mr. Housek had filed, seeking monetary damages for physical injuries and severe mental and emotional distress he said he had endured after an altercation with a student, John Arabian. In a deposition, Mr. Housek revealed that he had undergone therapy with Dr. Lifschutz for six months.",
		"20" : "Mr. Arabian’s lawyer, who subpoenaed Dr. Lifschutz, said that by claiming mental distress and revealing the therapy, Mr. Housek had waived his right to privacy about his prior psychological state.",
		"21" : "Nonetheless, Dr. Lifschutz refused a court order to testify, even though his lawyer was unable to find a precedent for a therapist’s asserting confidentiality when his patient had not done so.",
		"22" : "Cited for contempt of court on Dec. 5, 1969, he was ordered to San Mateo County Jail. He was released after three days pending resolution of the case. Dr. Lifschutz’s appeals, all the way to the Supreme Court, were denied.",
		"23" : "In April 1970, the California Supreme Court ruled that Dr. Lifschutz had to answer “at least the question” — which Mr. Housek had already confirmed — of whether he had treated Mr. Housek.",
		"24" : "Dr. Lifschutz confirmed that he had treated Mr. Housek and turned his records over to the presiding judge, who reviewed them privately and found nothing relevant to the lawsuit.",
		"25" : "“Having defended the principle of confidentiality in psychotherapy,” Paul W. Mosher and Jeffrey Berman wrote in “Confidentiality and Its Discontents: Dilemmas of Privacy in Psychotherapy” (2015), “Lifschutz decided discretion was the better part of valor and found a way to reveal only the bare minimum of his patient’s treatment a decade earlier.”",
		"26" : "The contempt citation was lifted in June 1970. As to why he was released after only three days, Dr. Lifschutz was later quoted as saying that the judges must have concluded, “There’s a psychiatrist in jail; we can’t let this go on.”",
		"27" : "During his weekend behind bars, he read Anthony Trollope’s novel “Phineas Redux,” from the 1870s, about a man falsely accused of murder who is vindicated in court. The judge’s order releasing Dr. Lifschutz was delivered by his 27-year-old lawyer, Nicholas S. Freud, who was a great-grandnephew of the father of psychoanalysis."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "MOSCOW — Holding on to the ankles of two of his opponents, Alex, a 33-year-old member of a Moscow soccer hooligan group, felt the blows on his head but wouldn’t let go. The third man on top of him was battering his skull with both fists, but still Alex held on, hoping to buy his teammates, battling around him, breathing space. At last, the man rammed his elbow down into Alex’s face, shattering his eye socket. He let go.",
		"2" : "This was not his first fight; years of organized brawls have left Alex with a face reshaped by blows. (Surgery and a plastic implant stabilized his eye after this most recent one.) And that last fight, nearly a year ago, had been a good one, Alex said in a recent interview. His side had won.",
		"3" : "What had unnerved him was a new feeling: He realized it was getting harder to keep up.",
		"4" : "When it first appeared in the 1990s, hooliganism in Russian soccer modeled itself heavily on the English version, adopting its clothes and terminology, including the term for its groups: firms. The Russians also embraced the English’s passion for blackout drinking and drunken brawling.",
		"5" : "“The English were our school,” said Yevgeny Malinkin, a fan in his 40s known as Kril. “Now we’ve lost our fathers. We’ve overtaken them.”",
		"6" : "In fact, Russia’s hooligan scene has undergone a transformation. The new generation bears little resemblance to the beery bravado and off-balance punch-ups associated with traditional European hooliganism, or even the sometimes militialike violence of South American ultras.",
		"7" : "Instead, the fans who have emerged in Russia over the past decade are obsessed with physical fitness, elite martial arts training and — at least while fighting — militant sobriety. Christened Okolofutbola, or “around football,” Russia’s hooligan scene has developed into perhaps Europe’s toughest, and just over a year before their country hosts soccer’s World Cup, the most hard-core Russian fans may be in the best fighting shape of their lives.",
		"8" : "But while their prowess is not in doubt, fan monitors, soccer officials and even the hooligans themselves say there is virtually no chance the disorder that the Russian fans brought to last year’s European Championship in France will be repeated on home soil.",
		"9" : "Instead, Russia’s hooligan groups are enduring an unprecedented crackdown by the authorities, who are determined that the World Cup will go smoothly. Interviews with more than a dozen fans and hooligan group members over the past five months have shed light on a wave of arrests and searches that have targeted the most violent fans and their leaders, as the police have turned measures more associated with antiterrorism operations and political repression against the hooligans.",
		"10" : "“Believe me,” said Andrei Malosolov, a soccer journalist who helped found Russia’s national supporters club, “the years before the 2018 World Cup will be the quietest in the history of Russian soccer.”",
		"11" : "In Marseille in June, it quickly became clear the Russians had come to fight.",
		"12" : "Thousands of English fans had packed the Old Port of the southern French city ahead of their team’s match against Russia at the European Championship. The English — many of whom had been drinking for three days — had occupied the waterfront’s cafes, from where some occasionally lobbed objects toward French riot police officers standing watch.",
		"13" : "The Russians, meanwhile, had landed in Barcelona, Spain. There they boarded buses for France, identifying one another by singing Russian punk songs. Arriving in Marseille, they received text messages with instructions on where to gather. Without even stopping to drop their luggage, most headed straight for the English.",
		"14" : "“We literally hadn’t managed to get to the end of the first beer before a clap rang out and our guys shouted, ‘So, what are we doing this?’” Ivan, a wiry fan who traveled with a dozen others to France, recalled in a Moscow bar recently. “We went into that square and started to just really, just to work in all 360 degrees.”",
		"15" : "(Ivan, like many of those interviewed who still take part in organized fights, declined to be quoted using his full name, for fear of a visit from the police.)",
		"16" : "The Russians hit the English like a cavalry charge. In minutes, the port was a battlefield, with fans clashing under barrages of flying bottles and pinwheeling chairs. About 200 Russian fans, many wearing masks and mixed-martial-arts fighting gloves, loped through the chaos, capturing their actions on  GoPro cameras strapped to their bodies.",
		"17" : "The violence continued in the stadium that night, when hundreds of English fans and neutrals were forced to scramble away from another Russian charge. The chaos left 35 people injured. While the English also had clashed with the police, resulting in a half-dozen arrests, most observers were transfixed by the Russians’ more efficient violence.",
		"18" : "The Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, described the Russians in almost military terms, telling reporters that they were “well trained” and “ready for hyper-rapid, hyperviolent operations.” The French police expelled 50 Russians — at least one fan leader sneaked back into the country and had to be deported a second time — and European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, fined Russia’s federation $170,000 and issued a suspended threat of disqualification for its team.",
		"19" : "Hanging over the entire episode, though, was a frightening new question: Would visiting fans risk attack from crack squads of hypertrained hooligans at next year’s World Cup? That some state news media outlets and government officials in Russia appeared to encourage, or at least condone, the violence sowed further doubt.",
		"20" : "“The Russian fans are different,” said Antoine Boutonnet, the head of the French police’s national hooligan division. “It’s almost paramilitary.”",
		"21" : "“I see the new generation, and I’m really surprised,” said Elena Bykova, a producer who made a film with an-all hooligan cast. “They don’t like drugs, alcohol. They’re all in the gym.”",
		"22" : "The fans’ evolution tracks larger movements in Russian society. A trend toward martial arts and fitness generally — partly promoted by the Kremlin and President Vladimir V. Putin, a trained judoka who is proud of his sporting image — has spread to fan circles. At the same time, Russia’s security state has reasserted itself, driving hooligan violence underground.",
		"23" : "While crowd trouble still occurs regularly at Russian league matches, at least a decade ago the authorities’ aggressive policing and closed-circuit cameras largely forced the most dedicated elements of Russian hooliganism to go, as the fans say, “into the woods.”",
		"24" : "They mean it literally. The bulk of Russian hooligan fights now take place in remote woods, where on weekends groups of young men from rival clubs form into two opposing lines in forest clearings. Then they attack each other.",
		"25" : "The bouts are savage. Top fighters measure them in seconds, with opponents usually incapacitated in less than a minute. Five minutes is a marathon.",
		"26" : "The rules are few: no weapons, and stop when commanded by a referee. That’s about it. Some courtesies are observed: Stamping on heads is frowned upon, though not barred.",
		"27" : "The fights are used as proving grounds. Recruits to various firms are invited to trial bouts, starting with seven-on-seven affairs, and then graduating to 15 a side, or 20. Elite fights can involve 80-on-80 brawls, and serious injuries are common: concussions, broken legs, cracked jaws, fractured skulls.",
		"28" : "“If they haven’t yelled, ‘Stop,’ you can continue,” said Alex, a member of RB Warriors, a well-known group that supports CSKA Moscow. “You need to beat them so that a person won’t stand up again. Because if they stand up, it means they can attack you from behind. But I never in my life will jump on someone’s head. Only those who are not strong do that.”",
		"29" : "The opportunity to measure themselves in such unrestrained tests of strength attracted those already practicing combat sports, particularly the forms of Thai boxing and other mixed martial arts now popular in Russia. An arms race among hooligan firms for the best fighters drove up the level. With the quality of fighters at a peak, drinking before a brawl is ill advised, but the pastime surged in popularity after Ms. Bykova’s 2013 film, “Okolofutbola.”",
		"30" : "Older fans marvel at the numbers involved now.",
		"31" : "“It became more like a type of sport,” said Ivan Sergeev, 37, a well-known former member of a top Moscow firm, Union, whose nickname is Il Duce.",
		"32" : "On a recent evening, two dozen young men gathered in a stylish Moscow gym. Wearing skull masks to shield their faces, they went through a warm-up before fighting practice bouts in boxing and wrestling.",
		"33" : "“It’s all on a different level now,” said Yevgeny Berezin, who led the session. Berezin fought in organized brawls for 10 years but recently stopped, he said, to focus on acting.",
		"34" : "The hooligan firms are now effectively underground fight clubs. Older fighters — usually only in their late 30s or early 40s — lament that many fighters are uninterested in soccer; one joked that stadium bans won’t work in Russia “because our fans don’t go to the football.”",
		"35" : "The participants are diverse — construction workers, information technology managers, fitness trainers — but the most active consider themselves elite fighters with an honor code. They insist they would never attack ordinary fans, only other hooligans.",
		"36" : "“Why beat up ordinary people?” Alex said. “It’s not interesting. It’s not fair.”",
		"37" : "He and others attributed the attacks on the English in Marseille to overenthusiasm, noting that the Russian fans there were not from top firms — they were young regional groups at their first big tournament.",
		"38" : "“There are some who like to drink and break stools over people’s heads,” Berezin said. “But that has nothing to do with Okolofutbola. That’s just some kind of hooligans.”",
		"39" : "Particular pride is taken in fighting exclusively bare-knuckle. Ultratrained hooligans have appeared in other countries — notably Poland and Germany — but only in Russia is it seen as having become entwined with the national character. Its supporters also point to the similarities of the fights in the woods to an old peasant game known as stenka na stenku, in which two villages would square off during festivals.",
		"40" : "For some, organized hooliganism has become a sort of primal expression of uninhibited Russian masculinity, and it appears peculiarly suited to a moment when the Kremlin is cultivating the idea that Russia must rely on its strength alone in its opposition to a bloodless, overcivilized Europe.",
		"41" : "After Marseille, Putin himself wondered aloud how “200 Russians could thrash several thousand English.” It was perhaps this context that led to an unlikely proposal recently by a Russian politician to make hooliganism a sport.",
		"42" : "“Given our fans are fighters, not hooligans,” the politician, Igor Lebedev, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and of Russia’s national soccer association, wrote on his website, “we can turn fans’ fights into a sport! Introduce rules, team competitions.”",
		"43" : "Lebedev’s proposal prompted horror in Europe, but it perhaps more reflected an increasing government effort to separate Russia’s hooligan scene from soccer.",
		"44" : "Last spring, a brawl between Moscow’s two top firms resulted in house arrest for five fans, including a firm leader. The men face jail time — an unusually harsh punishment for such a fight.",
		"45" : "The arrests spooked the fighters, as more detentions followed, as well as frequent searches of fans’ homes. Fans interviewed by The New York Times talked of receiving visits from armed police officers, and of telephone calls warning them that they are being watched.",
		"46" : "In September, Russia’s national supporters’ club, which represents fans, was shut down, while its chief, Aleksandr Shprygin, was arrested and briefly held in connection with the same brawl. The next day, Shprygin’s car was set afire by arsonists. The closing of the fan club, which presaged Shprygin’s arrest and arson attack, was viewed as a punishment for his championing the Russian fan violence at the European Championship in France.",
		"47" : "Since Shprygin is a former hooligan himself, his banishment has been seen as a sign that the Russian authorities didn’t want to appear to be backing violent fans ahead of the World Cup.",
		"48" : "In reality, though, the pressure on hooligan groups has been growing for years. Fans said it had intensified perceptibly after the 2014 revolution in Ukraine, in which Ukrainian soccer fans were seen as a critical force in battling the police. A previous crackdown followed a 2010 riot by fans in front of the Kremlin.",
		"49" : "The Interior Ministry’s Department E, responsible for monitoring terrorist and organized crime groups, now also monitors hooligans, with many fans believing their communications are under surveillance. Even the woodland fights have become infrequent, given the increased risk of arrest recently.",
		"50" : "“The movement is paralyzed,” Sergeev said.",
		"51" : "This month, Putin signed legislation imposing harsher punishments for fan misbehavior, introducing lengthy stadium bans.",
		"52" : "Piara Powar, the director of a fan monitoring group, FARE network, said he was “confident” that there would be no major trouble at the World Cup. Given the current pressure on fans, and the massive police deployment expected next year, fans here agreed there was little hope of fighting.",
		"53" : "Not that the hooligans wouldn’t like to.",
		"54" : "“There is a huge desire,” said Alex, the RB Warriors member. “Because when we have such an event happening — that is, when people from the whole world are coming here — I really want to.”",
		"55" : "Describing how it would happen, he said scouts would find foreign hooligans and relay their location. The Russians then would stalk the visitors before launching a surprise attack.",
		"56" : "“No one will kill anyone,” Alex said. “Just rough them up a little. You know, a light massage.”",
		"57" : "It would be such a shame not to, he said.",
		"58" : "“If they don’t arrest me,” he said, “then in 2018, God willing, I will beat someone.”"

		"1" : "You can blame it all on Percocet.",
		"2" : "I was three days post-hysterectomy and a little loopy on painkillers. After five years of weekly testosterone injections, the canal (I can’t stand calling it a vagina, much less referring to it as “my”) had atrophied to near nonexistence. This made surgery difficult; I tore. The pain was bad enough. The fact that it was in an area of my body I had tried to ignore made me feel even worse.",
		"3" : "I had been treating the ache with Percocet, at the cost of my lucidity. In a minor delirium, I developed a sudden need to tell a charismatic acquaintance — a girl from India in my physics class — just how beautiful and funny she was.",
		"4" : "It was winter break, and I was at home in Wisconsin, while she had remained in San Antonio, where we went to school. So I decided to send her a quick message.",
		"5" : "I ended up writing her a rambling letter.",
		"6" : "“Hey,” I began, “you have cow eyes. I know that sounds like a bad thing but have you ever looked into a cow’s eyes? They are so deep and brown and beautiful. I’ve looked into a lot a cow eyes because I’m from Wisconsin.”",
		"7" : "After ruminating for another paragraph about cows and eyes, I wrote about how, when I squinted at the back of her head during physics, it looked as though the kinematic equations on the whiteboard were growing out of her hair. Finally, mercifully, I concluded by asking if she wanted to get together after the break.",
		"8" : "The next day, looking for her response, I found my letter as a new email in my own inbox. In my stupor, I had sent it not to her but to myself.",
		"9" : "I didn’t try to resend it. But when I saw her back at school, I couldn’t resist telling the story of my misdirected, narcotics-fueled message. She laughed, then asked what surgery I’d had to get me on painkillers.",
		"10" : "“That’s top secret,” I said. “You need security clearance. I’m going to need fingerprint scans, and your phone number.”",
		"11" : "She gave me her number. But I didn’t give her security clearance.",
		"12" : "No one at school knew I was transgender. I had transitioned at 15 and arrived at college with no intention of discussing my unusual childhood with my peers. So far I had managed all right, but now, that intention was on a collision course with my dating prospects.",
		"13" : "The more she and I flirted, the more I realized how unprepared I was to explain my history. Should I tell her bluntly or start from the beginning? What if she was angry, or told the whole school? Listening to a friend boast of a recent hookup, I felt a bitter envy; how simple it must be to have a body that makes sense, that needs no explanation.",
		"14" : "After a few dates, I sat her down in the ornithology lab where I worked and tried to explain. Since she is pre-med, like me, I figured the simplest explanation was the medical one; how at the start of high school, after years of feeling like a boy trapped in a girl’s skin, I was told by my doctor that I had gender dysphoria, the product of a mismatch between body and brain.",
		"15" : "Although I tried to maintain a confident tone, I grew flushed and hot before I even managed to say the word “transgender,” and my voice grew so quiet that her growling stomach nearly drowned me out.",
		"16" : "When I was finished she sat very still, the only sound a whirring centrifuge, in the other room. I waited for her to get up and leave. She didn’t.",
		"17" : "Taking my hand, she said, “I had no idea.”",
		"18" : "In the flood of relief, I also felt a twinge of irritation. Of course she had no idea. I’m almost six feet tall, with a full beard and an Adam’s apple that had once poked a girlfriend in the eye. What would have tipped her off?",
		"19" : "“I don’t really care, I think,” she continued. “Just tell me if I say something stupid, O.K.? I don’t know a lot about it. I don’t know anything, actually.”",
		"20" : "For the next week, everything was fine. I was her first kiss. She fed me my first tikhi puri.",
		"21" : "Then one night, as we sat in her car, I learned that the biggest impediment to our relationship wasn’t that I was a boy with two X chromosomes, but something much more commonplace: my heritage. Her parents, who had immigrated to Texas from India when she was 5, feared that their culture would be diluted and lost in America, so she was forbidden from dating anyone who was not Indian.",
		"22" : "With my Midwest accent, ratty Packers sweater and frozen-tilapia complexion, I was the antithesis of the son-in-law they hoped for. She hadn’t told them about me and didn’t know if she ever would.",
		"23" : "A more painful breakup later on seemed inevitable, so we agreed to stop seeing each other. I hoped that the rationality of the decision would offer comfort. It didn’t.",
		"24" : "Soon enough, though, we drifted back to sitting with each other in physics. There, during a demonstration of magnetism, our professor pulled apart two neodymium discs, only to see them slide back together when she laid them on the table.",
		"25" : "We watched, took notes and imitated. Within a week, she was back in my bed. It wasn’t a decision, it was physics. Opposites doing what opposites do.",
		"26" : "After the first few days, when all I could think was how stupid we were being, our relationship had evolved into a surprisingly functional one, though with a few limitations. I couldn’t post photos of us together online, or talk in the background while she spoke to her parents on the phone. Once she had to accessorize her temple apparel — a colorful, traditional kurti — with an oatmeal-like woolen scarf to cover the hickeys I had carelessly left the night before.",
		"27" : "We went on muck-collecting expeditions to find anaerobic bacteria for her microbiology class. I found a way onto the roof of the student center, where we would go to look at the stars. At first I made jokes about how doomed we were, but as we grew closer the jokes stopped being funny.",
		"28" : "She was truly unfazed by my transness. I exulted in this; it seemed as though I had finally cleared the last hurdle between me and the mundane heterosexual existence I had yearned for. Joking about reincarnation once, she said I must have had great karma to be a human in this life.",
		"29" : "“It couldn’t have been that good,” I said, “or I wouldn’t have wound up in a girl’s body.”",
		"30" : "She rolled her eyes. “It’s not a girl’s body. It’s yours.”",
		"31" : "As we lay together at night, listening to the possum living in my ceiling scuffle back and forth, we initiated each other into our opposite and alien existences. I told her about the ordeals of my middle-school years and the euphoria of my first testosterone shot, the suicides of friends, the post-transition balancing game pitting safety against loss of identity.",
		"32" : "And, feeling homesick, I told her about walking on frozen Lake Monona, and how the Wisconsin woods turn orange and then black and stay black for too long, until you think you’re going to die in the lonely cold before the ice ever melts. And how one day everything turns green, the trees and branches and trunks and even the boulders, too.",
		"33" : "She had never seen snow. I had never seen sugar cane fields.",
		"34" : "She told me about her grandparents’ blue house in Gujarat, where she had lived while her parents tried to ground themselves in Texas, and the terror of the plane ride to meet them; 5 years old and flying to America in a cabin full of strangers.",
		"35" : "She attended weekly services at the local Hindu temple and would do her best to explain what had been talked about that day, despite my total religious ignorance. My favorite faux pas: Telling her we should name the elephant figurine on her dashboard Elphy McTrunkface. It turned out he already had a name: Lord Ganesh.",
		"36" : "She and I are still together, and we will almost certainly break up. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and trust — like any healthy pairing — but also on denial. She cannot marry me. We both know this, though I think she knows it better than I do.",
		"37" : "The foolhardy logic I use to rationalize my commitment to her will no doubt worsen my inevitable heartbreak. But for now, it sustains me. As animosity toward brown-skinned immigrants seems to worsen daily in this political climate, and anti-transgender bills that strip me of my dignity draw closer to becoming law in the Texas Legislature, there are days when we wake up scared, go to bed scared and navigate our isolation in between.",
		"38" : "Why not find refuge, however finite and daring, with each other? In a time of such upheaval and uncertainty, our reckless, quiet love feels like deliverance."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "SAN FRANCISCO — What if part of your job became teaching a computer everything you know about doing someone’s job — perhaps your own?",
		"2" : "Before the machines become smart enough to replace humans, as some people fear, the machines need teachers. Now, some companies are taking the first steps, deploying artificial intelligence in the workplace and asking their employees to train the A.I. to be more human.",
		"3" : "We spoke with five people — a travel agent, a robotics expert, an engineer, a customer-service representative and a scriptwriter, of sorts — who have been put in this remarkable position. More than most, they understand the strengths (and weaknesses) of artificial intelligence and how the technology is changing the nature of work.",
		"4" : "Here are their stories.",
		"5" : "Rachel Neasham, travel agent",
		"6" : "Ms. Neasham, one of 20 (human) agents at the Boston-based travel booking app Lola, knew that the company’s artificial intelligence computer system — its name is Harrison — would eventually take over parts of her job. Still, there was soul-searching when it was decided that Harrison would actually start recommending and booking hotels.",
		"7" : "At an employee meeting late last year, the agents debated what it meant to be human, and what a human travel agent could do that a machine couldn’t. While Harrison could comb through dozens of hotel options in a blink, it couldn’t match the expertise of, for example, a human agent with years of experience booking family vacations to Disney World. The human can be more nimble — knowing, for instance, to advise a family that hopes to score an unobstructed photo with the children in front of the Cinderella Castle that they should book a breakfast reservation inside the park, before the gates open.",
		"8" : "Ms. Neasham, 30, saw it as a race: Can human agents find new ways to be valuable as quickly as the A.I. improves at handling parts of their job? “It made me feel competitive, that I need to keep up and stay ahead of the A.I.,” Ms. Neasham said. On the other hand, she said, using Harrison to do some things “frees me up to do something creative.”",
		"9" : "Ms. Neasham is no ordinary travel agent. When she left the Army after serving as a captain in Iraq and Afghanistan, she wanted to work at a start-up. She joined Lola as one of its first travel agents. Knowing that part of her job was to be a role model, basically, for Harrison, she felt a responsibility for Harrison to become a useful tool.",
		"10" : "Founded in 2015 by Paul English, who also started the travel-search site Kayak, Lola was conceived as part automated chat service and part recommendation engine. Underlying it all was a type of artificial intelligence technology called machine learning.",
		"11" : "Lola was set up so that agents like Ms. Neasham didn’t interact with the A.I. much, but it was watching and learning from every customer interaction. Over time, Lola discovered that Harrison wasn’t quite ready to take over communication with customers, but it had a knack for making lightning-fast hotel recommendations.",
		"12" : "At first, Harrison would recommend hotels based on obvious customer preferences, like brands associated with loyalty programs. But then it started to find preferences that even the customers didn’t realize they had. Some people, for example, preferred a hotel on the corner of a street versus midblock.",
		"13" : "And in a coming software change, Lola will ask lifestyle questions like “Do you use Snapchat?” to glean clues about hotel preferences. Snapchat users tend to be younger and may prefer modern but inexpensive hotels over more established brands like the Ritz-Carlton.",
		"14" : "While Harrison may make the reservations, the human agents support customers during the trip. Once the room is booked, the humans, for example, can call the hotel to try to get room upgrades or recommend how to get the most out of a vacation.",
		"15" : "“That’s something A.I. can’t do,” Ms. Neasham said.",
		"16" : "Diane Kim, interaction designer",
		"17" : "Ms. Kim is adamant: Her assistant doesn’t use slang or emoji.",
		"18" : "Her assistant, Andrew Ingram, also avoids small talk and doesn’t waste time on topics beside scheduling her meetings, she said.",
		"19" : "Ms. Kim isn’t being tyrannical. She just knows her assistant better than most bosses, because she programmed him.",
		"20" : "Ms. Kim, 22, works as an A.I. interaction designer at x.ai, a New York-based start-up offering an artificial intelligence assistant to help people schedule meetings. X.ai pitches clients on the idea that, through A.I., they get the benefits of a human assistant — saving the time and hassle of scheduling a meeting — at a fraction of the price.",
		"21" : "It’s Ms. Kim’s job to craft responses for the company’s assistants, who are named Andrew and Amy Ingram, or A.I. for short, that feel natural enough that swapping emails with these computer systems feels no different than emailing with a human assistant.",
		"22" : "Ms. Kim’s job — part playwright, part programmer and part linguist — didn’t exist before Alexa, Siri and other A.I. assistants. The job is like a translator of sorts. It is to help humans access the A.I.’s superhuman capabilities like 24/7 availability and infallible memory without getting tripped up by robotic or awkward language.",
		"23" : "Even in the narrow parameters of scheduling meetings, it takes a lot of machine learning to break down emails for a computer. For example, setting a meeting for “Wednesday” is different than setting a meeting for “a Wednesday,” as in any Wednesday. X.ai breaks down emails to their component parts to understand intent.",
		"24" : "The automated response is where Ms. Kim takes over. Her job is to imagine how a human assistant would arrange a meeting for the boss. For a specific task, she devises different situations — for example, what if the meeting had five attendees versus two — and then she creates a flow chart of how the email exchange would go.",
		"25" : "The goal is to schedule a meeting in as few emails as possible. With that in mind, x.ai settled on a set of personality traits for its assistants: polite, professional, friendly and clear.",
		"26" : "Sometimes, it’s hard to predict what will rub people the wrong way. Early on, the A.I. assistant sent emails to potential attendees saying that the assistant would be happy to put something on the boss’s “calendar,” but some people found that wording to be cold, and not always appropriately deferential to the other attendees.",
		"27" : "X.ai changed the wording so that the A.I. assistant says it would be happy to “find a time” that works for all attendees.",
		"28" : "Some people try to test the A.I. assistants with unusual requests. For example, people are curious what else the assistants can do and ask for help in booking hotels, flights or conference rooms (things they can’t do). Others ask Amy’s age, or Andrew’s birthday. “How do we elegantly recover when Amy or Andrew don’t know what to do?” Ms. Kim said.",
		"29" : "X.ai doesn’t pretend the assistants are human. But Ms. Kim still gets satisfaction when people don’t realize that the assistants are robots. People ask them out on dates. They receive thank-you emails from happy customers even though, as robots, they don’t need gratitude.",
		"30" : "“They’re shocked and surprised that they were talking to an A.I.,” she said.",
		"31" : "Dan Rubins, chief executive",
		"32" : "Mr. Rubins has a lot of grievances with lawyers.",
		"33" : "At his former job, he recalled the time when six corporate lawyers, each billing at hundreds of dollars an hour, were inspecting a contract looking for capitalization errors. It’s what prompted him to create Legal Robot, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence to translate legalese into plain English.",
		"34" : "Having reviewed nearly a million legal documents, Legal Robot also flags anomalies (strange wording or clauses) in contracts. “Lawyers have had 400 years to innovate and change the profession, and they haven’t done it,” said Mr. Rubins, who is not a lawyer. “It’s time for some outside help.”",
		"35" : "He said legal documents are well suited to machine learning because they are highly structured and repetitive. Legal Robot tapped a vast trove of contracts prepared by human lawyers in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission — “a cesspool of legal language,” Mr. Rubins said — as well as past documents from law firms who wanted to help train Legal Robot’s systems.",
		"36" : "After going through a large set of documents, the company’s machine learning systems start to recognize patterns indicating the words that tend to go together and those that do not. However, Mr. Rubins becomes worried when the A.I. is too confident about its results. That’s often a byproduct of training the computer on too narrow a set of contracts.",
		"37" : "For example, Legal Robot trained its A.I. on thousands of employment contracts from a state that allows noncompete clauses, which restrict employees from switching to a rival company. That meant when the A.I. saw contracts from states where noncompetes aren’t enforceable, it nevertheless piped up to say the clause was missing. In other words, the A.I. was missing important context.",
		"38" : "Mr. Rubins, 33, said the A.I. is good at identifying potentially vague word choices. He recently received a two-page nondisclosure agreement — it was reviewed by human lawyers — from another company containing the word “shall” 30 times. The A.I. pointed out that “shall” can be vague and advised that “will” or “may” are more clear, depending on the context.",
		"39" : "Mr. Rubins doesn’t think A.I. will put lawyers out of business, but it may change how they work and make money. The less time they need to spend reviewing contracts, the more time they can spend on, say, advisory work or litigation.",
		"40" : "“I really don’t think we’re going to get rid of lawyers,” he said. “Unfortunately, we still need them.”",
		"41" : "Sarah Seiwert, customer representative",
		"42" : "It took two weeks for Ms. Seiwert to notice that her company’s A.I. computer system was starting to pick up on her work patterns.",
		"43" : "Ms. Seiwert, 37, a customer representative at the online test-prep company Magoosh, answers student emails. When a question comes in, she searches a database of preapproved responses and finds the appropriate answer.",
		"44" : "There are thousands of different responses. Finding the right answer isn’t as easy as it sounds.",
		"45" : "When Magoosh implemented an A.I. system in February to help its customer service team work more efficiently, Ms. Seiwert noticed that it was reading the questions and suggesting responses.",
		"46" : "If the suggestions were good, she would add a few niceties and send back a quick reply. But within two weeks, she noticed that even when she wasn’t responding directly to an email, but following up to one that she had sent earlier, the software was suggesting the proper response.",
		"47" : "“That was a ‘wow’ moment for me,” said Ms. Seiwert, who works from a home office in Mankato, Minn. “It’s been studying and learning my patterns.”",
		"48" : "As more customer service moves from phone calls to text-based conversations through chat or email, companies are looking to machine learning to help the human agents work faster. Magoosh is using software created by DigitalGenius, a London-based start-up.",
		"49" : "When an email comes into Magoosh, the system reads the email, categorizes it and routes it to the appropriate employee. After a few months, some DigitalGenius customers start to automate responses for some common questions. Basically, this happens when the A.I. has seen enough examples of how human agents handled the request that it gains confidence that its answer will be correct.",
		"50" : "Magoosh isn’t there yet. But Ms. Seiwert said the software has reduced Magoosh’s queue of customer requests by half, and it has made her team’s goal of responding to every customer within 24 hours more manageable.",
		"51" : "Even though the A.I. is learning from the human agents, Ms. Seiwert said she doesn’t foresee a future where she’s out of a job. Too many questions still require a level of human intuition to know the appropriate answer. There are also times when rules need to be broken, like when customers ask for an extension on their account because of some circumstance beyond their control.",
		"52" : "“I am not convinced that artificial intelligence is going to replace us,” she said. “You can’t program intuition, a gut instinct. So the A.I. might get very intelligent, but I hope as a human I continue to get intelligent and not stand at a standstill.”",
		"53" : "Aleksandra Faust, software engineer",
		"54" : "As a senior software engineer at the self-driving car company Waymo and a robotics expert, Ms. Faust grapples with an unpredictable world.",
		"55" : "Formerly known as Google’s self-driving car project, Waymo wants to build autonomous vehicles that can react properly under all kinds of unusual circumstances. Not only when drivers run red lights, but also when a child crosses an intersection riding a hoverboard while walking a dog (which happened recently).",
		"56" : "Waymo’s cars have driven two million miles in the real world and billions more in computer simulations. But it’s impossible to program for every event.",
		"57" : "“There’s always going to be some cases that we haven’t seen before,” Ms. Faust said. “Based on the situations it’s seen, the A.I. helps the car react in situations it hasn’t seen.”",
		"58" : "Safety is a concern, said Ms. Faust, 43, but so is comfort. Take the process of braking at a red light. When human drivers see a red light, they tend to slow down gradually before coming to a full stop. Waymo’s driverless car was hitting the brake too abruptly in a way that human drivers would do if they weren’t paying attention.",
		"59" : "However, a sudden stop is dangerous because other drivers may not be paying attention. And it is jarring for the passengers.",
		"60" : "Using real-world examples of how human drivers slow to a stop from different speeds, Ms. Faust’s team creates different models for the most natural way a car should brake depending on how fast it is going. “One thing we’ve learned about human driving is that it’s very, very complex,” said Ms. Faust, who joined Waymo two years ago when it was still part of Google’s research lab, X."

		"1" : "Going on a vacation to learn a skill you have long wanted to pick up sounds like an ideal getaway, but proceed with caution, said John Spence, the president of Scott Dunn USA, a travel company in Solana Beach, Calif., that specializes in customized tours. “If you don’t pick the right skill for you, or go in with unrealistic expectations, your precious time off won’t be enjoyable,” he said.",
		"2" : "Here, he shares his advice on planning a learning vacation that you won’t regret taking:",
		"3" : "FOLLOW YOUR PASSION The options for what you can learn on your vacation are limitless, and include cooking, photography, art history, farming or a sport such as diving or horseback riding. To get the most out of the trip, Mr. Spence advises choosing something you’re passionate about; also, if you’re traveling with others, don’t be unduly influenced by their interests. “I’ve had instances with clients where friends piggyback on each other’s learning trips and don’t have the best time because they’re not particularly keen on that skill,” he said.",
		"4" : "A LITTLE, OR A LOT? With whatever skill you intend to learn, figure out whether you want an immersion or only to occupy a portion of your trip. It’s possible to learn cooking basics, for example, by taking a weeklong course at Ballymaloe Cookery School in County Cork, Ireland. Another option is to enroll in several half-day classes at the school and have more free time to explore the destination itself. “Spending your entire break devoted to learning something new can be overwhelming, so make sure that it’s what you really want,” Mr. Spence said.",
		"5" : "CONSIDER YOUR BUDGET No matter the skill, you can learn it by taking a vacation in a wide range of price ranges, and having a clear idea of your budget will help you home in on the right trip. If you want to learn scuba diving, for example, heading to the Maldives will cost several thousand dollars per person, while a scuba diving trip to the Florida Keys is a more wallet-friendly proposition. Another example: Mr. Spence recently planned a learning trip for a group of friends where he hired a private photographer to teach them photography in Chobe National Park in Botswana. That trip cost $12,000 a person, but he said some group photography courses in the United States cost just a few hundred dollars.",
		"6" : "DON’T FORGET THE CHILDREN Learning vacations can be great family trips, too, provided that they are fun, not overly educational. “Yes, you want your kids to learn, but you don’t want them to be bored by overloading them with too much information,” Mr. Spence said. His favorite child-friendly options include the Junior Ranger program at Tswalu Kalahari Reserve in South Africa, where children learn wildlife tracking, and a class at the Gladiatorial School Rome, where families can learn about gladiatorial combat."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "People in New Orleans won’t bat an eyelash if you put a pig’s tail or feet on a plate in front of them, said Marcus Jacobs, the chef for and an owner of Marjie’s Grill in Mid-City: “You can go to a gas station and buy pig’s feet pretty much anywhere in town. People are open-minded about those kind of ‘off cuts.’”",
		"2" : "While traveling in Southeast Asia, Mr. Jacobs and his partner and the restaurant’s other owner, Caitlin Carney, who are alumni of the fine dining stalwart Herbsaint — discovered similar appetites for “off cuts” in Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. “People make a lot of comparisons between the Mississippi Delta and the Mekong Delta,” Mr. Jacobs said. “They’re not afraid to eat weird pieces of pork. There’s a lot of cultural crossover.”",
		"3" : "Weird pieces of pork are indeed on the menu at Marjie’s Grill, and they are sublime. During a recent visit, I could have ordered a dozen plates of pig knuckles — salty, crispy and unctuous morsels drizzled with cane syrup, down-home and decadent. I washed them down with a tropical sunset-hued cocktail called the Rad Jam made with tequila, Campari and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit (a beer and juice mixture). And if crisp, spice-dusted cracklings and supple slices of soy- and chile-glazed pork jowl are weird, who could want normal?",
		"4" : "The palatable balance of sweet, salty, spicy and acidic flavors typical of Southeast Asian cuisine pairs fabulously with Gulf ingredients, many of which are smoked, grilled or coal-roasted over a barbecue pit out back, a feature reminiscent of that at Mr. Jacobs and Ms. Carney’s pop-up restaurant, Sparklehorse Grill. “We enjoyed doing pop-ups with this food but knew we could do more,” she said, so they began looking for a permanent spot. They opened Marjie’s Grill — named after Ms. Carney’s mother — in December.",
		"5" : "At Marjie’s, rich, charred ribbons of cabbage are brightened with cilantro and scallions and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Cornmeal-coated and fried head-on Gulf shrimp are sweet and crunchy, while Mississippi beef tartare tossed with mint and cilantro and savory fried shallots is meltingly tender. Coal-roasted Gulf fish — a firm and flaky sheepshead the night I dined — is served on its blackened skin beside a bouquet of fresh, leafy herbs meant for wrapping and dipping bites of the fish into a lively, citrusy sauce.",
		"6" : "I finished things off with johnnycakes smeared with strawberry jam and topped with a sweet praline. The balance between Delta influences was all off, favoring the Mississippi and abandoning the Mekong. It was surprisingly incongruous end to an otherwise delightful meal."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Most Americans view current levels of economic inequality as a problem: In fact, for 30 years, Gallup polls have consistently found a clear majority supporting a more even distribution of wealth and income.",
		"2" : "But there is far less agreement on how to achieve that goal. Do we need to level the playing field so that people born to modest circumstances have a better chance? Should we be trying to instill a stronger work ethic in the United States, and build a more robust culture of hard work? Counterproductive and, at times, bitter arguments bog down the search for solutions.",
		"3" : "A recent paper by the psychologists Shai Davidai of the New School of Social Research and Thomas Gilovich of Cornell University reveals a quirk in human psychology that, I think, is responsible for some of our failure to make much progress on those issues. Understanding that quirk could help us find common ground on how to help the poorest Americans.",
		"4" : "In public talks, Mr. Gilovich illustrates the research findings by displaying two separate Google image searches. The first, for “headwind,” elicits many pages of vivid cartoons and photo images, as you will see if you try it yourself. But if you search for “tailwind,” you will be hard pressed to find any compelling images at all.",
		"5" : "One metaphor is well represented, both in our imaginations and in our iconography, while the other is neglected.",
		"6" : "This asymmetry reflects a deeper psychological bias: We tend to remember the obstacles we have overcome more vividly than the advantages we have been given.",
		"7" : "This bias is embedded in our day-to-day lives. Most of our time and energy goes toward overcoming the challenges immediately in front of us. Headwinds demand attention because they must be overcome. Tailwinds may evoke a momentary sense of well-being and gratitude; but primarily, they free us to focus elsewhere, on challenges that must be overcome.",
		"8" : "Mr. Davidai and Mr. Gilovich show some of the broader social and political consequences of this psychological asymmetry. They find, for example, that both Democrats and Republicans believe that electoral maps are not apportioned to their advantage. The scholars also find that, within families, people tend to think their parents were tougher on them than their siblings recognize.",
		"9" : "Of course, we don’t really know what is going on inside everyone’s mind, but it does appear that many of us overrepresent the obstacles we face.",
		"10" : "In many autobiographies, for example, even fortunate people, born to rich, loving families, look back on life and remember all the things that stood in their way. Not only do we play the starring role in our own life stories, but those stories often revolve around struggle.",
		"11" : "I see this tendency in myself. When it comes to education, I have won not just one but several birth lotteries: Many children born next to me in rural India struggled to obtain anything beyond simple primary education and maybe a decent high school. Yet I had some of the best educational resources placed right in front of me all the way through my doctorate at Harvard.",
		"12" : "I would be foolish if I did not remind myself of these advantages every day. Yet it is telling that I do need to remind myself. My spontaneous thoughts are of the challenges I faced, not the advantages I had.",
		"13" : "This cognitive bias, I think, sheds light on persistent disagreements over inequality and opportunity that affect many of us in American society.",
		"14" : "When we see our own past in terms of the headwinds we managed to overcome, it is easy to attribute the failure of others to a lack of perseverance. When poor children drop out of high school, someone who complains that these children don’t have an adequate work ethic may be remembering educational hurdles that she managed to surmount early in her own life.",
		"15" : "We often disagree over the source of our success: Those who emphasize the existence of birth lotteries point to the easy ride the well-off have had. Yet relatively privileged people may look at their own lives and feel, “I’ve struggled too.”",
		"16" : "Arguing about these perceptions doesn’t seem to be productive. We may try a different approach. Poverty, after all, is not only caused by strong headwinds; it is also characterized by a lack of tailwinds. If we work on creating more tailwinds — by giving poor children more advantages — we can solve many otherwise intractable problems.",
		"17" : "Consider that by high school, poor children are doing much worse than those from well-off families. Researchers have found that most of this gap accumulates not during the school year, but in the summer months. In Baltimore, for example, a study has found that the entire achievement gap between the poor and the well-off is accounted for by learning disparities in the summer.",
		"18" : "During these months, richer children benefit from summer programs and books around the house, and, more broadly, from the myriad advantages of having parents with the resources, knowledge and time to intellectually engage them. Even conversation around the dinner table can be a tailwind.",
		"19" : "Closing the achievement gap could, then, be about generating tailwinds for poor children. In many ways, the provision of decent public education is itself a tailwind; it is, if not a complete equalizer, more equal than home life. But we could do more. For example, some have suggested the creation of a Summer Opportunity Scholarship to help low-income youth.",
		"20" : "From a public policy perspective, it may be easier to agree on creating tailwinds than on removing headwinds. Even people who take great pride in having gotten ahead through hard work can, if prompted and upon reflection, recognize the tailwinds that helped them. This recognition does not detract from their genuine effort. Instead, it can be a moment to be thankful, perhaps for a family member who believed in you, or an unexpected piece of good fortune at just the right time.",
		"21" : "By focusing on tailwinds, we can sidestep potential disagreements about the role of personal responsibility and initiative. Even with a tailwind, hard work is still needed; that work just yields more reward. A summer scholarship is not a substitute for serious effort.",
		"22" : "We could garner support for such programs by asking people to remember the tailwinds in their past: It is a small step from gratitude for one’s blessings to the realization that everyone can use a little help, the poor most of all."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Corporations are people, Mitt Romney once told us. But if the Trump administration’s tax plan were to become law, in the future a whole lot of people may just become corporations.",
		"2" : "That’s because of a huge loophole implied by the broad tax ideas the administration recently released. Unless revised in actual legislation, the plan would give millions of Americans the opportunity to cut their taxes by essentially turning themselves into small business entities.",
		"3" : "This mind-bending curiosity of the tax code could undermine the very idea of a job as we know it — or, arguably, accelerate a shift that has been underway for years.",
		"4" : "The opportunity to game the system arises from the huge gap between the tax rate paid on individual income — up to 39.6 percent now, or 35 percent under the Trump plan — and the low rate on business income the president proposes, of 15 percent. He seeks to apply that rate to all businesses, including “pass-through” organizations such as limited liability companies and S corporations, and that is where the opportunity for games arises.",
		"5" : "For example, I am currently an employee of The New York Times, paid a salary every two weeks to write articles about economics. My earnings are labor income; I happen to be in the 28 percent tax bracket.",
		"6" : "Suppose I instead formed Irwin Scribblings L.L.C., a “company” dedicated to providing economics writing services. Irwin Scribblings could then contract with The Times to provide articles about economics for a rate equivalent to the value of my current salary and benefits.",
		"7" : "Under current law, I would pay the same taxes on that business income that I do on personal income. In important ways I would be worse off, as I would need to pay more of my own payroll taxes, wouldn’t have unemployment insurance, and would need to get health insurance through some channel other than my employer.",
		"8" : "But under the Trump tax plan, my tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 28 percent, saving thousands of dollars a year — enough to justify those annoyances.",
		"9" : "Higher earners have even more to gain from this trick. Many of the costs attached to paying an accountant or a lawyer to set up the structure are fixed, perhaps on the order of several hundred dollars, whereas the potential gains are unlimited and rise with one’s income. And of course people in higher tax brackets gain more from reducing their rate to 15 percent.",
		"10" : "This is no abstraction. After Kansas eliminated its state tax on pass-through income, the number of people taking advantage of the exemption soared, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue for state coffers.",
		"11" : "Pass-through entities include a variety of corporate structures with one thing in common. They do not pay federal income tax directly, but rather pass their earnings along to their owners, who in turn pay individual income tax on the money. That avoids the problem of double taxation faced by C corporations (the structure most commonly used by the biggest companies), which pay the corporate income tax directly and whose investors must pay taxes on dividends they receive.",
		"12" : "But if the tax code is changed to lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, from its current 35 percent, that creates a different fairness problem. Suddenly C corporations would have much lower tax rates than competitors that happen to be organized using pass-through structures, such as S corporations and limited liability companies.",
		"13" : "Those companies include about 28 million entities, many of them quite small, but also many large enterprises like car dealerships, real estate partnerships and law firms. These interests are lobbying hard to have their organization’s profits taxed at the same low rate as C corporations may receive in a tax overhaul.",
		"14" : "Lawmakers and tax experts have proposed various solutions to prevent blatant tax avoidance using pass-throughs, and the Trump administration has signaled openness to them, while not specifying any particular approach.",
		"15" : "One blunt and powerful way would be for the tax code to allow only some fixed percentage of pass-through income to benefit from the lower tax rate. The problem is it would undermine the goal of putting a lower rate on pass-through income to begin with. That goal is to put these entities on an even tax footing with firms that pay the corporate income tax.",
		"16" : "There are more subtle approaches that limit the types of firms that can take advantage of the low rate, though those involve complex rules and the I.R.S.’s taking a more invasive role in trying to enforce them. I for one do not want an I.R.S. agent asking a bunch of nosy questions to try to figure out if Irwin Scribblings is a real company or a gimmick to lower my taxes.",
		"17" : "Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center has an intriguing idea in which pass-through entities would distinguish between standard returns that business owners receive on capital they directly put into that business, which would be taxed at the low rate, and returns above that level. The latter returns would be taxed like labor, on the assumption that when a business achieves some extraordinary return, it suggests the business owner is really just paying for his or her own labor in a different way. That, though, would penalize entrepreneurs whose ventures have hit it big.",
		"18" : "Whichever approach Congress might take to rein in some of the opportunities for exploitation that a 15 percent pass-through rate creates, there is a more fundamental issue at stake.",
		"19" : "Simply put: The bigger the gap between the ordinary income tax rate and the tax on pass-through businesses, the more incentive that people — especially high-earning people — will have to find a way to game the system.",
		"20" : "If the pass-through tax rate were set at 25 percent, the 28-percent-tax-bracket people wouldn’t have much incentive to try to play these games. (Farewell, Irwin Scribblings.) But the highest earners, who face a top income tax rate of 39.6 percent on millions of dollars, most certainly would.",
		"21" : "“As long as you have differential rates, there will always be incentives to try to classify income in ways that take advantage of whichever rate is lower,” said Scott Greenberg, an analyst at the Tax Foundation.",
		"22" : "Moreover, people with that much money at stake will have more ability and incentive than merely upper-middle-income people to hire good accountants and lawyers to ensure they comply with the letter of the tax code and I.R.S. regulations, if not necessarily the spirit. It’s not worth paying lawyers a few thousand dollars to save a few thousand dollars. It is worth paying lawyers a few thousand dollars to save a few million.",
		"23" : "All of that means that the low pass-through rate creates inherent advantages in the tax code for anyone wealthy enough and clever enough to try to find ways to exploit it, implicitly hurting those of us who are mere wage earners.",
		"24" : "That in turn raises questions about the nature of work in the 21st century.",
		"25" : "Right now, there might be a big difference in compensation between a top corporate executive and the most junior person in a factory or office floor. But one thing they share is that they are payroll employees of the company, tied to its success and with a variety of protections, like health insurance and retirement benefits, linked to that status.",
		"26" : "Already that definition at work has been eroded from one direction, with companies seeking to classify more of their workers as “independent contractors” who are essentially small businesses but without the tax advantages created by the Trump tax plan.",
		"27" : "A world with highly favorable treatment of pass-through income could create a dynamic where the traditional definition of a job is chipped away at the high end, with the best-compensated executives seeking to redefine their work relationship as a contract between a company and an S corporation or L.L.C.",
		"28" : "For every child who grows up dreaming of having a limited liability company of his or her own, President Trump’s tax plan promises a dazzling future."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — In a meeting at the White House with business leaders two weeks into his presidency, Donald J. Trump turned to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.",
		"2" : "Aren’t the Chinese manipulating their currency? Mr. Trump asked, according to two people who were there.",
		"3" : "“No, Mr. President, they’re not,” Mr. Dimon replied. “I think they’re trying to be responsible.”",
		"4" : "Others at the meeting, including the former Boeing chief W. James McNerney, agreed. Their advice echoed arguments by members of Mr. Trump’s staff and cabinet that he should abandon his campaign pledge to punish China over its currency.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump was listening. Two months later, facing a strengthened United States dollar and the need for Chinese support against a pugilistic North Korea, he reversed his position.",
		"6" : "The meeting with Mr. Dimon and other corporate executives was just one of dozens of sessions Mr. Trump has convened with top businesspeople since becoming president. Nearly 300 executives have visited the White House this year, according to a New York Times tabulation, an open-door policy that is a sharp break with the Obama administration and puts corporate chieftains on par with senior lawmakers in the pecking order of who has influence in Washington.",
		"7" : "Frank and occasionally confrontational, the conversations have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s young presidency, inspiring policy debates and in some instances 180-degree shifts by the president, according to White House officials and executives who have participated in the discussions.",
		"8" : "And while some Democrats and other critics complain business leaders are being granted unfettered access to Mr. Trump — who ran as a businessman planning to apply executive principles to Washington’s problems — the White House is unapologetic. The relationship-building is acting as a welcome substitute for a lack of legislative accomplishments, and presidential aides suggest the rapport positions Mr. Trump for future success.",
		"9" : "“The whole idea is, do something with all of this communication and feedback,” said Chris Liddell, the president’s assistant for strategic initiatives and a former chief financial officer at Microsoft and General Motors. “And some of that happened in the first hundred days, but we’re really setting ourselves up for the next thousand days.”",
		"10" : "Many executives said that they were rarely given face time with President Barack Obama, and that even when they were, they sensed he wasn’t fully engaged. “The feedback from the Obama White House was, ‘We’ll listen to what you have to say, but we know what we’re doing,’” said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.",
		"11" : "The parade of chief executives has included familiar Republican faces, like Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone and Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric.",
		"12" : "But it has also included Democrats. Larry Fink, the chief of BlackRock, was a potential Treasury secretary had Hillary Clinton won the presidency; on Friday, he blasted the administration’s approach to immigration and cast doubt on the economic models underpinning its proposed tax cuts, saying, “There is a lot of uncertainty due to the new administration.”",
		"13" : "Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was a Clinton supporter who predicted in January that Mr. Trump would do “evil things” as president. And Charles Phillips, chief executive of the software company Infor, sat on Mr. Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.",
		"14" : "“As he’s shaping his view, he is kind of learning a lot of things,” Mr. Phillips said of Mr. Trump. “So this is a good time, in this first six months, to go in there.”",
		"15" : "Alcoa’s chief executive, Roy Harvey, experienced that firsthand on Thursday, as he watched Mr. Trump sign a memorandum directing the Commerce Department to investigate the effects of aluminum imports on national security.",
		"16" : "“We appreciate the support of the administration to try to make a level playing field,” Mr. Harvey said.",
		"17" : "Mr. Trump’s dialogue with business leaders has at times been freewheeling, and at times focused on topics that were first dissected in small sessions with staff or cabinet members. At the gatherings, some executives, who have been cowed by the president’s itchy Twitter finger and tendency to take quick offense to perceived slights, have found Mr. Trump open to disagreement.",
		"18" : "At the meeting when the Chinese currency was discussed, Elon Musk, the South African-born chief of Tesla and SpaceX, attacked a newly signed executive order banning travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not only did Mr. Trump welcome the criticism, said the people who were present, he calmly defended his position, noting that public-opinion polls supported his viewpoint before sharing the floor with John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary.",
		"19" : "Some business leaders have parlayed their White House access into support for specific causes. In a TED talk on Friday, Mr. Musk said, “I’ve used the meetings I’ve had to argue in favor of immigration and climate change,” according to a Twitter post published by the organization. Mr. Schwarzman of Blackstone encouraged Mr. Trump to soften his hard-line stance on deporting so-called Dreamers — the young, undocumented foreigners living in the United States.",
		"20" : "Late last year, IBM’s chief executive, Ginni Rometty, wrote a letter to the president-elect, urging him to expand vocational job-training programs. That idea, which she later repeated directly to the president at the White House, was integral to a meeting Mr. Trump called with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and several multinational companies. Mr. Phillips of Infor also raised the subject of job training.",
		"21" : "“Because of these conversations, it really became a significant focus of the administration,” said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.",
		"22" : "Executives are hoping the White House will support putting federal education grants toward skills-training programs rather than just traditional college. So far, however, the administration hasn’t taken a public stance on the legislative efforts to do so.",
		"23" : "Mr. Trump’s unofficial business cabinet was handpicked, in many cases, by influential companies and trade associations. On the president’s first full weekday in office, he welcomed a dozen industrial executives who had been convened by Andrew Liveris, head of the Dow Chemical Company. A senior staff member at the Retail Industry Leaders Association put together a panel of executives drawn from her group’s ranks.",
		"24" : "Mr. Schwarzman recruited a range of business leaders, economists and policy experts for the president’s strategic and policy forum, which regularly meets at the White House and has emerged as the most elite outside counsel.",
		"25" : "To be invited to the policy forum, there were a few criteria, according to someone who was briefed on the selection process: Be an expert in your field who is respected by Mr. Schwarzman, be a United States citizen and don’t be vetoed by Mr. Trump.",
		"26" : "The task of dealing day to day with the chief executives falls largely to Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, and Mr. Cordish, a Baltimore real estate scion, who share a cramped office in the West Wing. It is decorated with a laminated United States map and a full-page ad, ripped from The Wall Street Journal, that thanks Mr. Trump for agreeing to reconsider fuel-economy standards. It was purchased by auto trade groups.",
		"27" : "During a recent interview, Mr. Liddell and Mr. Cordish were upbeat. Since the White House “listening groups” began, Mr. Cordish said, they’ve been barraged with ideas from executives and trade groups for deregulation, job creation and the streamlining of services.",
		"28" : "In a meeting in early April, a group of 50 or so chief executives involved with the Partnership for New York City proposed adding public housing to Mr. Trump’s infrastructure initiative. The idea was recirculated at another trade group meeting about a week later, suggesting that the White House was seriously considering it.",
		"29" : "Some of the infrastructure changes under consideration would improve the government’s own inner workings, including at the White House itself. “A lot of technology here is 20 years out of date,” Mr. Liddell said.",
		"30" : "But even with all the access, some chief executives are frustrated with what they describe as well-intentioned but so far fruitless talk — and a public environment that can be leery of any cooperation with the Trump administration.",
		"31" : "Robert Hoopes, a consultant who advises nonprofit groups and large companies and has done work for prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said executives were making a careful calculation when they traveled to Pennsylvania Avenue. If the topic for discussion is core to your business, Mr. Hoopes said, “you want to be a part of that conversation.” But if the session is peripheral or unrelated to your business, he said, the “risk calibration” is very different.",
		"32" : "Two dozen trade-group officials and chief executives, some of them suggested as potential interview subjects by the White House, either refused to speak for this article or didn’t respond to messages. Others declined to be quoted on the record, citing the toxic environment and the potential fallout among the public and their own employees for being regarded as an ally of Mr. Trump.",
		"33" : "“Usually, when a campaign is over, things settle down and people feel they can work with the president without having a backlash,” Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City said. “In this case, there continue to be divisive forces that don’t want that to happen.” C.E.O.s, she said, “feel pressure from all sides.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "CALAIS, France — The clang of giant weaving looms ricocheted across a cavernous factory one recent afternoon at Desseilles Laces, one of the oldest lace makers in France. A handful of workers flitted among the machines, guiding gossamer threads into a floral confection destined for luxury lingerie and couture dresses.",
		"2" : "The halls here, and at hundreds of lace factories around Calais, were once thick with employees. But as competition from countries with cheaper labor costs buffeted France, waves of layoffs swept through this working-class town on the edge of the English Channel.",
		"3" : "Today, fewer than 300 employees remain at just three factories — Desseilles, Noyon Dentelle and Codentel — a fraction of the 30,000 whose livelihood depended on lace less than two generations ago. Around Calais, the hulking brick skeletons of abandoned lace factories cast shadows over modest, low-slung houses. And Desseilles was recently taken over by a Chinese investor, drawing laments that a crown jewel of the industry had fallen into foreign hands.",
		"4" : "It has been a painful retreat for an industry whose delicate creations symbolized “Made in France” know-how, an economic pattern repeated across the country and one of the most divisive issues in the presidential election.",
		"5" : "From steel mills to auto factories, the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs to globalization has created social distress — and competing visions from the candidates about how to fix it. France’s rigid labor laws, despite recent reforms, add a layer of complexity by making it difficult for companies to adjust to a shifting economy.",
		"6" : "In ravaged industrial areas like Calais, anger about the impact of globalization is fierce, as unemployment tops 20 percent and the remaining factory floors rely more heavily on machinery than manpower.",
		"7" : "The far-right firebrand Marine Le Pen won big in last Sunday’s presidential runoff in such locales. Her pledges to revive industry in France, impose “intelligent” protectionism and roll back harmful European policies have found a ripe audience.",
		"8" : "And while Emmanuel Macron, the liberal former economy minister, is expected to win on May 7, France’s blue-collar bastions may yet prove a liability. His vows to create jobs by keeping France open to global competition and easing labor rules must win over disenchanted workers who have seen incomes and job security erode.",
		"9" : "“Marine Le Pen says this election is about the patriots versus the globalists,” said Famke Krumbmüller, the head of research at OpenCitiz, a political risk consultancy in Paris. “She’s right: The new cleavage opposes those who feel they have lost from globalization and want economic and national protectionism, versus those who think the answers to France’s problems also lie in European and international openness and cooperation.”",
		"10" : "French lace has long been a symbol of refinement. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, the French aristocracy drove demand for the luxurious adornments that were just starting to be produced in Calais. Today, superfine lace continues to embellish outfits of the elegant, whether as a cascade of sheer flowers on the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress, or layered in couture gowns on catwalks around the world.",
		"11" : "Lace-making began to flourish here in the early 19th century, after three British weavers smuggled giant looms, called Leavers machines, across the English Channel to evade English restrictions on selling lace to the French.",
		"12" : "They set up in the textile-making town of Calais. The new industry blossomed, and the metallic click of the Leavers looms vibrated in Calais’s narrow streets day and night. Some streets are named after leaders of an industry that ushered in jobs, prosperity and a cosmopolitan makeover that would sustain the town’s families for generations.",
		"13" : "The dream began to unravel around the 1960s. Factories still relied heavily on the antique Leavers looms, which were slow and required many employees. When more efficient lace-knitting machines were added, workers lost jobs.",
		"14" : "Shifting fashion trends also affected demand, as women started wearing pants, plainer shirts and fewer dresses and undergarments trimmed with lace. More casual lifestyles took their toll on lace tablecloths and handkerchiefs.",
		"15" : "In the ensuing decades, more jobs were lost as factories opened in Asia, cranking out lower-quality but passably pretty lace. Many of Desseilles’s clients shifted their buying away from Europe.",
		"16" : "Labor costs were up to 15 times cheaper in Asia than in France, where employers also pay high taxes on salaries to fund the generous social welfare system. “A French person working 35 hours a week cost the same as 15 Chinese,” said Michel Machart, the head of MM Textile, a consultancy.",
		"17" : "Then in 2005, the European Union abolished textile import quotas, allowing cheap garments — and knockoff lace — from Asia to flood the European market. It was the final blow.",
		"18" : "Soon, only a few thousand of the 30,000 lace-related jobs that had existed 30 years earlier were left. The sound of Leavers machines gave way to silence as layoffs accelerated and factories were abandoned.",
		"19" : "Unemployed lace workers in Calais went to nearby steel and paint factories, only to see them shutter, too.",
		"20" : "Manufacturing in France in general has fallen from about 25 percent of the economy in the 1960s to around 10 percent today, putting millions of people out of work.",
		"21" : "Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on the disenchantment. “The main thing at stake in this election is the rampant globalization that is endangering our civilization,” she told supporters last Sunday. She wants to pull France out of “harmful” European pacts and hold a referendum on membership in the European Union. Around Calais, which used to vote for the far left, Ms. Le Pen’s posters promise to “Bring Order Back to France.”",
		"22" : "Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, says that business-friendly policies and sticking with the European Union are the way to shield France from globalization’s threat.",
		"23" : "“Globalization can be a great opportunity,” he said on the campaign trail. On Wednesday, he repeated his message at a Whirlpool factory destined for closure in his hometown, Amiens, after a visit by Ms. Le Pen. But in a stagnant economy with high unemployment, he was jeered by some workers, who blamed cheap competition for killing jobs.",
		"24" : "At Noyon, executives tried to play the globalization game. In 2003, they opened a factory in Sri Lanka. Like Desseilles, Noyon was still making expensive Leavers lace for high-end lingerie clients, and hoped the production in Sri Lanka would improve margins.",
		"25" : "It didn’t stop the bleeding. With around 800 workers in Calais, representing 60 percent of Noyon’s costs, revenue kept eroding.",
		"26" : "Noyon laid off hundreds of employees, many of whom had spent their lives in the factories. “It hit all types of workers,” said Henri-Philippe Durlet, the general director of Noyon. “It was people who designed patterns, threaded bobbins, cut lace, maintained the machines, as well as drivers and customs officers who had less to inspect.”",
		"27" : "As losses mounted, Noyon filed for bankruptcy last September and was on the verge of closing until a group of French lingerie makers swooped in to invest, wanting to protect their high-quality supply. Today, with just 170 employees, it is the largest lace factory in town.",
		"28" : "The only way it can keep a competitive edge, Mr. Durlet said, is by maintaining the exquisite design and quality of French lace that artisans have perfected for decades.",
		"29" : "Desseilles faced a similar fate, exacerbated by French labor laws. In 2011, facing what Michel Berrier, an owner, called “catastrophic losses,” Desseilles went into receivership to shed nine of its remaining 74 workers in a bid to survive.",
		"30" : "But five employees, among them protected union leaders, sued to be reinstated. In 2015, a court ordered Desseilles to rehire them with back pay and damages, a cost of nearly one million euros. With debts of €600,000, it was money Desseilles did not have.",
		"31" : "The company was forced into bankruptcy. “Globalization isn’t the only reason we ran into trouble,” said Mr. Berrier, surveying his near-empty factory floor. “The French labor laws put the last nail in the coffin.”",
		"32" : "Ms. Le Pen’s National Front party issued a news release blaming cheap Chinese competition and the French labor code for endangering Desseilles.",
		"33" : "Yet it was a Chinese investor, Hangzhou Yongsheng Group, that rescued the company, acquiring it in 2016.",
		"34" : "Since then, Yongsheng, which runs textile and investing companies in Asia, has increased productivity, installing a bright new LED system that allows employees to easily identify flaws, and grouping Leavers machines closer together so that one employee can work several looms at once. Yongsheng also added new looms, and linked employee pay to production.",
		"35" : "“‘Made in France’ matters — the expertise is here,” said Cloris Li, Yongsheng’s manager in France, who wants to start an Asian luxury label using French-made lace. “I hope I can bring a brighter future to Desseilles.”",
		"36" : "With the factory humming again, Mr. Berrier hired five new employees, and hopes to obtain seven more.",
		"37" : "Even there, the French system can provide disincentives. When he tried to hire a lace maker whom Noyon had laid off, he said, the man told him he was collecting so much of his old salary through unemployment, he saw no point in working.",
		"38" : "The last of the lace makers are relieved to have jobs, but many are nostalgic for the days when French lace was king. Most have family ties to the factories that go back for generations.",
		"39" : "“I learned how to string a bobbin when I was 11,” said Sonia Rengot, 47, a lace maker at Noyon for over 30 years. “Everyone in Calais had someone in the business.”",
		"40" : "Today, when she walks around town, she can tell just by looking in a shop window whether the lace on a dress was made in Asia or in Calais.",
		"41" : "Jean-Philippe Lenclos, 50, has worked the lace machines at Desseilles for 30 years. “We’ve seen our colleagues leave one after another,” he said. “I’m the last one: My three children are teenagers, but none of them wants to do what their father is doing.” He added that the younger generation has grown up hearing only about layoffs.",
		"42" : "Even as they hope the factories will stay afloat, the lace makers seem aware that the damage to France’s lace industry — and to other manufacturers around the country — is permanent. On the streets of Calais, no one really expects the factories to return.",
		"43" : "Mr. Durlet, the Noyon executive, does not think either of the presidential contenders is capable of reversing France’s industrial decline. Not Mr. Macron, with his pledges of keeping France open to globalization. Not Ms. Le Pen, with her vision of hard protectionism.",
		"44" : "“She talks about closing borders, but what will that serve?” Mr. Durlet asked. “Nothing. ”",
		"45" : "But for some on the factory floor, Ms. Le Pen’s promises have struck a chord.",
		"46" : "“People are so disappointed that they will go vote for Marine Le Pen out of frustration,” said Renato Fragoli, a 23-year Desseilles veteran who led an employee group called the Forgotten, which backed Yongsheng’s bid to keep the factory from closing.",
		"47" : "“It’s truly sad,” said Mr. Fragoli, recalling the scores of longtime workers who left the factory amid waves of layoffs. “But I can understand them. The jobs have disappeared.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "It has been 100 days of gold-plated promises and red baseball caps; 100 days of ethical questions and contradictions; 100 days of rule breaking and rumpled posturing.",
		"2" : "I’m not talking about policy making, you understand. I’m talking about image making. Though to a certain extent, when it comes to the Trump administration, it often seems as if they are one and the same.",
		"3" : "After all, the president came into office a brand: one that, in his billowing navy suits and too-long power ties, his signature blond comb-over and fake tan, was redolent of ersatz 1980s nostalgia. He came with a wife and daughter who were effectively his own brand extensions, and a visceral made-for-TV understanding of the power of style to give what seemed like substance to his words.",
		"4" : "It worked in the campaign. But the transition from self-branding to state branding has been, it seems, more complicated than anticipated. Like the business of governing itself.",
		"5" : "On Day 1, President Trump stood on the steps of the Capitol and pledged his determination to “buy American and hire American.” Cheering him on was his special adviser Kellyanne Conway, in what appeared to be a superpatriotic red, white and blue coat — that turned out to have been bought from an Italian brand (Gucci) whose products were manufactured in (surprise) Italy, and whose designer had been inspired to create it in honor of … the British. Huh. It was a moment of bungled dress symbolism that turned out to be a harbinger of much more to come. Practically every week.",
		"6" : "It’s not that what the president and his cohort wear is more important than what they do (or don’t do), the legislation they dismantle or the geopolitical relationships they threaten, but that their confused image-ineering has somehow become a lightning rod — a subject of debate, mockery, compulsive attention — representing all the rest of the above.",
		"7" : "There has barely been a week since Jan. 20 without some sort of style news related to the administration bubbling up. Fashion, from the industry to the individual, has played a role in the opening narrative of this president that it hasn’t in any other administration. As a compelling expression of a (sur)real time it is, literally, everywhere you turn.",
		"8" : "There was the first lady channeling Jacqueline Kennedy in Ralph Lauren on Inauguration Day, seemingly giving living proof to her husband’s agenda and the age-old tradition of first ladies supporting local industry — until a few weeks later, when she returned to supporting Dior, Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana, whose jacket she chose to enshrine in her official portrait. The industry, meanwhile, cast itself in the role of the resistance (along with pretty much every late-night talk show host and their costume departments), with designers from Sophie Theallet to Tom Ford marking their distance, or hid in the shadows, apparently afraid to be seen as endorsing the new administration.",
		"9" : "Not that Mrs. Trump needs them: She buys her own clothes, so she can do what she wants, and then she lets her clothes do the talking for her as she stands by in enigmatic silence. Even if that means settling into a look that calls to mind a militarized version of 1950s womanhood, one that favors tightly belted coat dresses instead of housedresses, with the passive-aggressive role playing that implies.",
		"10" : "Speaking of the military, it, too, was pulled into the story when Mr. Trump boasted that his generals came straight from “central casting,” though apparently Sean Spicer, the press secretary, didn’t get the message until he was told to start dressing for his part behind the lectern. He smartened up, but then kept spilling on the ties, not to mention sporting his de rigueur American flag pin upside down during one briefing. As a sartorial metaphor, really, it doesn’t get much better than that.",
		"11" : "The president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, however, does understand the desired dress code, as does Mr. Kushner’s rival Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, who swapped his hunting jacket for a casual-Friday blazer when he got his office in the West Wing. Still, Mr. Kushner one-upped the costume parade when he wore a navy blazer under his flak jacket on a trip to Iraq. It may have prompted multiple comic memes — though possibly not as many as were inspired by a New York Times photo of Donald Trump Jr. in his woodsman outfit — but that probably mattered less than pleasing the boss back home.",
		"12" : "Admittedly, Mr. Kushner did not also wear a tie under the vest, but it’s possible that the only real tie of meaning belongs to the president himself: a red flag to all sorts of bulls that he wears like a primary-colored malapropism in the face of endless criticism (it is too long; he uses tape to hold it together), giving himself an anti-elitist gloss even as his promotes his Master of the Universe credibility.",
		"13" : "It’s a sartorial contortion matched only by that of his daughter Ivanka. Her role in his administration has forced her to wrestle with the peculiarly modern existential question of whether it is possible to extricate herself from a company that bears her name and was founded on her image, not just officially (that can be done) but philosophically (that’s another issue). Or if every time she Instagrams a picture of herself looking like a perfectly polished version of what Wendi Murdoch (in her piece on Ms. Trump for Time magazine’s “Most Influential” issue) called a “modern working mom,” it acts as a sales stimulus, whether intended or not, and hence a call to arms.",
		"14" : "Case in point: her presence, along with other officials, at a dinner her father hosted at Mar-a-Lago for President Xi Jinping of China — on the same day the Chinese authorities approved her company’s trademark applications. Everyone denied the two events were related, but the problem was obvious for all to see.",
		"15" : "“See” is, in many ways, the operative word — not just for that particular moment, but in this particularly visual age, for them all."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "A rarity in a business like fashion, where fairy-tale transports are most often town cars, the story of Edward Enninful, recently named the next editor of British Vogue, began on the London tube.",
		"2" : "Born in Ghana and raised in Ladbroke Grove, an unglamorous neighborhood in west London, Mr. Enninful was discovered in 1989 on the Hammersmith and City Line by the fashion stylist Simon Foxton.",
		"3" : "It was not necessarily a fashion sighting. Mr. Foxton recalled Mr. Enninful in those early days in an ever-present duffel coat and National Health-style glasses, the arms of which would occasionally be mended with tape. Still, Mr. Foxton said in a recent interview: “He must have had something about him. I don’t stop that many people.”",
		"4" : "Mr. Enninful went home and asked his mother’s permission to model for Mr. Foxton. He had to. He was all of 16.",
		"5" : "Duly, if reluctantly, permitted, the teenager appeared in a shoot done by Mr. Foxton and the photographer Nick Knight, for i-D magazine, the upstart London style bible. He was transfixed. He quickly went from Mr. Foxton’s model to his assistant.",
		"6" : "“I seem to remember he said he was wanting to go to college to do law,” Mr. Foxton said, “But once he saw the bright lights of fashion, he thought, ‘Oh, well, forget that.’”",
		"7" : "So began a nearly three-decade career in fashion, which has taken Mr. Enninful, now 45, from the chaotic offices of i-D to fashion shows and photo shoots the world over to — as of this August, when he and his partner, the filmmaker Alec Maxwell, will relocate to London — the tony doorstep of Vogue House in Hanover Square. His appointment represents a timely rupture with tradition. He is a gay black man in a position that has been held for 100 years by a white woman, for the last 25 by the departing editor, Alexandra Shulman.",
		"8" : "“It does show that there is a God,” said Mr. Knight, who continues to work with Mr. Enninful. “He’s broken that mold. I think that offers a lot of hope for people who see fashion as something they couldn’t ever get into, that they’d be shut out from.”",
		"9" : "Mr. Enninful, who declined to be interviewed for this article, may have been little more than a lad from Ladbroke Grove at the outset, but he happened down one of London fashion’s most fertile and febrile rabbit holes. I-D had been founded a few years earlier by Terry Jones, a former British Vogue art director who struck out on his own to document a London that was truer to what he saw in the streets than in Vogue’s high-gloss pages. Its Covent Garden office was a magnet for ambitious young talent, which Mr. Jones assessed without overmuch regard for age, station or experience. Mr. Foxton compared it with a drop-in center. Money was a secondary concern, and a spirit of can-do reigned. Mr. Enninful came with Mr. Foxton, and for some 20 years, stayed.",
		"10" : "“He was basically soaking up what he needed to set himself up,” said Judy Blame, a stylist and jewelry designer who contributed to i-D. “I suppose we were his mad college.” Mr. Blame invited Mr. Enninful to move into his house, which belonged to the singer Neneh Cherry; Mr. Enninful stayed a year.",
		"11" : "Mr. Enninful distinguished himself early, and when i-D’s fashion editor left for another magazine not long after, Mr. Jones appointed him to succeed her — despite the fact that he was 18 years old.",
		"12" : "“It’s gut instinct,” Mr. Jones said of the choice. “The nature of i-D was to start people who didn’t already work with major magazines, usually at the beginning of their careers, and then just give them support. I always wanted that energy, that fresh beginning, when people have got their eyes open and are prepared to take risks.”",
		"13" : "Suddenly Mr. Enninful was a person to be reckoned with. Mr. Blame took him to Paris to see the runway collections there for the first time. They cadged shelter from friends and slept on the hotel-room floors of better-budgeted editors. I-D was a favorite of the designers on the cutting edge.",
		"14" : "“All the designers that I knew gave us really good tickets,” Mr. Blame said. “It caused a bit of a stir: ‘Who is that boy with Judy?’ ‘Oh, he’s the new editor of i-D.’ There weren’t that many black faces in the front row.”",
		"15" : "“He was a bit nervous, to tell you the truth,” Mr. Blame added. “I was glad to be there to hold his hand and say, ‘You’re the bloody editor of i-D! Jean Paul’s given us front row, come on. Helmut wants to see you afterward.’”",
		"16" : "Mr. Enninful adapted quickly. Soon he and the magazine were attracting new attention. He met Naomi Campbell, who said he is like a brother to her, at a shoot for i-D in Paris in 1993. “I’d heard of him,” she said, and when she arrived on set, “I loved his style, I loved his personality, I just loved him.”",
		"17" : "“Any model will tell you, to this day,” she said. “Even when Edward was at i-D — they never had a big budget — but no matter what, if Edward called, the girls would jump on a plane and do it. We knew it was going to be a great story, creatively. We wanted to be part of it.”",
		"18" : "He was promoted at i-D, and bigger commissions followed. Mr. Enninful began a long and fruitful collaboration with Steven Meisel at Italian Vogue, and Grace Coddington paved the way for a contributing position at the American edition. He styled major fashion shows and high-paying ad campaigns, including Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Dior.",
		"19" : "It was not a transition without growing pains. Mr. Enninful’s appearance in “The September Issue,” the 2009 documentary about the making of the year’s largest issue of Vogue, painted him as a journeyman stylist, whose work gets scrapped for not living up to Anna Wintour’s high standards. “Where’s the glamour?” she is seen demanding in one scene. “It’s Vogue, O.K.? Please, let’s lift it.” (Ms. Wintour called Mr. Enninful’s British Vogue appointment a “brilliant choice.”)",
		"20" : "But Mr. Enninful also had plenty of triumphs, often with Mr. Meisel, from their famous plastic-surgery sendup to Italian Vogue’s history-making 2008 Black Issue, featuring only models of color, for which Mr. Enninful was one of a handful of collaborating stylists. A growing number of models and celebrities were impressed by his warmth and ease (products, his collaborators say, of intense preparation and research).",
		"21" : "“Most times people in his position, they’re pushing a brand on you or pushing an agenda on you,” said the musician Pharrell Williams. “The only thing Edward ever pushes is the best part of who you are to come out, to be photographed and to take charge. The most presidential section of your essence — he knows how to find that. That’s a unique talent.”",
		"22" : "In 2011, Mr. Enninful left i-D and Vogue to become fashion and style director of W magazine. The British Fashion Awards gave him the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator in 2014, and he was named an Officer of the British Empire in 2016. “I was so terrified I was going to be late for him, I set the clock an hour ahead of time,” said Ms. Campbell, who has a famously self-determined approach to punctuality. She accompanied him to the ceremony, and co-hosted a celebration for him afterward at Mark’s Club, attended by Kate Moss and Madonna.",
		"23" : "The honor was intended in part to recognize Mr. Enninful’s service to diversity in the fashion industry, a cause that is both personal and longstanding. In 2013, he addressed the issue head-on, when he tweeted his displeasure at a seating assignment during the haute couture shows: “If all my (white) counterparts are seated in the front row, why should I be expected to take 2nd row? racism? xoxo.” It quickly went viral.",
		"24" : "In a subsequent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Enninful declined to identify the designer whose show he had left, and said: “Change always takes time. The fashion industry needs to breed a whole different way of thinking. We need more diverse people working in all facets of the industry.”",
		"25" : "But more often he has expressed his commitment to diversity through his work, in particular by championing models of color in his photo shoots and fashion shows. “There are so many girls that have had an opportunity because of Edward,” said the designer Brandon Maxwell, a former assistant of Mr. Enninful’s.",
		"26" : "The truth is, there is scarcely more diversity in fashion today than there was when Mr. Enninful was himself a model in the late 1980s, and indeed maybe less, as the London scene from which he emerged drew voraciously and promiscuously from the intermingled worlds of music, art and club culture as well as the narrower milieu of fashion.",
		"27" : "“In today’s media, we often see tokenism and gimmicks, what I call forced diversity,” said Joe Casely-Hayford, the longtime London-based designer, who is black. “What Edward stands for, he’s in a league of his own when it comes to championing diversity, and different notions of beauty in a consistent, relevant and authentic way.”",
		"28" : "Mr. Casely-Hayford credited this to Mr. Enninful’s education at i-D, and to his own background. The standard-bearers of London fashion in the 20th century, he said, ticking off Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, “came with a fearlessness that you couldn’t find in the leafy suburbs.”",
		"29" : "“I think Edward is cut from the same cloth,” he continued. “In order to progress, we need to challenge the status quo. This is something that Edward will bring to Vogue. It’s the real essence of fashion — it’s fashion, not frocks. Nowadays, you see pages and pages of frocks.”",
		"30" : "This is perhaps particularly true of British Vogue, which, despite its eminence, has lagged behind in both the reach of its American cousin and the boundary-pushing radicalism of its Italian and, to a lesser degree, French counterparts. It is seen by many in the industry as a quainter, more commercial and prettier, but less pathbreaking, magazine than some photographers would like.",
		"31" : "Across the board, photography in particular has suffered. Compressed shooting schedules, budgets and pressure from advertisers have bred timidity from editors and compromised the more creative work of years past. “I think for a long time in Vogue magazine you haven’t seen a real support for fashion photography,” Mr. Knight said, “which is sort of odd, because fashion photography is the reason Vogue magazine exists.”",
		"32" : "Mr. Enninful, on the other hand, is devoted to the photographers he works with (besides Mr. Knight and Mr. Meisel, they include Steven Klein, Craig McDean, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott and Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, among many others) and beloved by them in return. His shoots are intensive, baroque productions — Rihanna as a queen in peace and in war, Ms. Moss as an enameled nun — and he represents, his collaborators hope, a return to a more photography-driven British Vogue.",
		"33" : "“He’s someone who’s primarily concerned with the picture being amazing,” Ms. van Lamsweerde said. “ He really is the best collaborator I know.”",
		"34" : "In an industry still haunted by stereotypical devils, tyrants and snobs, Mr. Enninful leaves an unusual trail of good vibes in his wake. Still, even to his friends, news of his appointment was a happy surprise. The rumor mill had been churning, but Mr. Enninful’s name was usually mentioned after current and former British Vogue staffers — among them Emily Sheffield and Jo Ellison — whose profiles more closely fit the established archetype.",
		"35" : "“We went bowling on my birthday just recently and he didn’t tell me,” said Marc Jacobs, a close friend, who was with Mr. Enninful the day before the announcement was made. “He said, ‘I didn’t want to take away from your day.’ That sums up what kind of person he is.”",
		"36" : "Mr. Enninful’s original collaborators said they were delighted by the news.",
		"37" : "“Over the years, I’ve seen his career trajectory and now it seems almost inevitable,” Mr. Foxton said. “But back then, if you’d told me? I wouldn’t have believed you.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "It’s morning in Stardew Valley, and I’m a child again! Dawn twinkles. Azure skies. Birdsong. It’s dreadful.",
		"2" : "Morning after morning in the tight circadian cycles of this precious pastoral role-playing game — which has become all the rage among city-dwelling parents leery of Roblox Prison Life and similar gun-heavy games — I’m reborn to about second grade. But not in the sense of fresh and innocent, suffused with wonder. I’m childlike meaning incompetent, can’t do a danged thing. Can’t grow a potato, can’t open my mailbox, can’t make a friend.",
		"3" : "The friendship problem is especially grim. I approach a blonde — a honey with a “Hee Haw” vibe — and present her with a decorative bowl as a gift. She calls me “gross.” Then I give a child named Demetrius some highly useful sap and he says, “This is disgusting.”",
		"4" : "Another way I’m like a child in Stardew Valley is that I’m forever on the brink of getting in trouble — for hoeing a crooked row, missing my curfew, trying to enter a bus with a pickax. (An accident! My pickax intel was not 100 percent!) This is a game of honest toil, in dirt, with fellow farmers, requiring only the sweat of my brow and an earnest heart. So it’s a little crushing to find that everything I do in Stardew Valley seems wrong.",
		"5" : "A PC game aimed at the Minecraft demo, Stardew Valley is played on a desktop or a laptop, using a platform like Steam — which is to say probably Steam itself, as Steam is considered the largest digital distribution platform for computer games.",
		"6" : "Download Steam, from which Stardew has been downloaded over a million times, and you find a trove of games that, for now, are thought more refined and dignified than console games; they also feature fewer massacres, consume less floor space that the room-swallowing sofa-television-PlayStation matrix, and can easily toggle with, say, Microsoft Word. Using discreet laptop angling you can even play Stardew and look like you’re working.",
		"7" : "Stardew Valley, which in 2016 The Verge and many others named to their best-of-the-year lists, has other virtues that might turn the head of even the most principled anti-gamer. For one, the action in it is nonfelonious (unless “felony” covers barely visible, accidental and entirely unwitnessed property damage to a bus with a pickax). Stardew Valley also encourages teamwork, friendship and even romance; it’s downright communitarian.",
		"8" : "But best of all it’s an indie game, which means it was created by a auteur developer, Eric Barone, without a megabucks publisher focus-grouping and then adjusting it to please only the alpha gamers who carp the day away on Twitch. Indie games, in other words, show the maker’s hand more than market research. Minecraft also started as an indie project.",
		"9" : "But, see, I can’t play Minecraft. The closest I come is eavesdropping on my children and their friends as they discuss that game’s arcana, including how they might best prosecute digital goat thieves. Not only does the opaque idiom of Minecraft seem infinitely rich in their hands, but when Minecraft — and now Stardew — come up on their screens, they intuitively grasp their locations and purpose in nonspace. They also know how to amass the inventory of stuff that drives progress in these games. While I was still walking into Stardew Valley trees, and trying to chop them down with a daffodil, they had built up enough lumber for a log-homes empire.",
		"10" : "Sigh — my cabin. My foodless, loveless, plumblingless cabin. Good morning. So my avatar, who looks like a stout Andy Warhol, has learned to water the plant! I give it a good soaking. There’s a bulky tube television I can’t turn on; I have the good idea to sell it. My for-sale bin rejects it. I decide to go for a walk.",
		"11" : "Defying the filmic realism of console games with Cubist graphics, Stardew Valley is the magnum opus of prodigy designer Mr. Barone, whose nom de jeux is ConcernedApe. The game is a skillful revision and extension of a beloved 1997 release called Harvest Moon, and both nostalgic gamers and their offspring have greeted it as an instant old friend.",
		"12" : "It’s the game’s tender, clever frame story that distinguishes it. Theorists of narrative often point out that the hard-working opening paragraphs of a novel must briskly transform a person who is not reading into one who is. Stardew Valley gets this just right, with a deathbed scene wherein “my” grandfather presses on me an envelope, which, in a flash-forward, I open while suffocating at a future office job, strikingly rendered by Mr. Barone as a fading tech enterprise with stained, gunmetal desks that speak of gutting despair. Grandpa’s letter tells me that he once “lost of what mattered most in life … connections with other people and nature.” He “dropped everything and moved to the place where I truly belong,” and suggests I follow his lead: right to a cut screen, and then an arable plot of land and sturdy cabin in the cartoon Eden of Stardew Valley.",
		"13" : "With this tale, the game brilliantly styles itself as a verdant refuge from the internet — social media, shooter games and the moral vacuum digital culture is said to open up in us. Though of course Stardew Valley is on a screen itself.",
		"14" : "I have a surprise knack for violence here. When I sorted out that the ax (not the flower) is for chopping, I became like Once-ler in “The Lorax” — hacking away at the old-growth beauties and shipping the fragments off for profits. At midmorning — time flies here — I eye a bona fide cherry tree with a newfound perversity that recalls Warhol himself; I go nuts and ax it to bits. The signature transgression of the father of our country leaps to mind. Chopping down a pretty cherry tree turns out to be id-driven, and no joke. Sadly, I have no friend to whom I cannot lie.",
		"15" : "But then! The key is the daffodil! “What a thoughtful gift!” my blonde exclaims this time. I find her warmth heartening. I redouble my commitment to popularity and light off in search of first daffodils and other flowers with which to wow them; filled with purpose, I collect a cheery bouquet.",
		"16" : "On another screen my 7-year-old daughter now has enough friends for a Shire-like jamboree. I’m not invited.",
		"17" : "It’s almost night. In the game, that is. Tomorrow, soul refreshed by fellowship, I will actually till my land and do my grandfather proud.",
		"18" : "On a whim, I glance out my apartment’s real window. It’s a magnificent spring day in the real world, rich with highly realistic graphics. My window needs washing, which speckles the view, so the blue sky is also imperfect, the way the real world can sometimes be, and the Stardew farmscape is not.",
		"19" : "I’ve been playing this game for hours, and — it hits me like a sock to the gut — I seem to have lost sight of what matters most in life, connections with other people and nature. Time for a walk with the children. To my surprise, they’re ready to peace-out on Stardew Valley, too. We drop everything and move to the place where we truly belong."

		"2" : "Credit the forthcoming nuptials of Pippa Middleton, who will marry next month, most probably dressed in a fragile variation on the modestly cut gown worn by her sister, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, on her wedding day.",
		"3" : "Whatever its impetus, a similarly chaste spirit has infiltrated bridal wear, lending regal authority to the spring 2018 collections shown all over town last week.",
		"4" : "“We’re exiting away from the sexy, sheer look,” said Rachel Leonard, the editorial director for the Bridal Council, a trade group. “We’re moving toward statements about romance, femininity, sensuality and pure simplicity.”",
		"5" : "To some minds, that shift in direction arrives not a moment too soon.",
		"6" : "“My collection was a reaction to the very naked dressing that was happening last year,” Vera Wang said. “More coverage felt newer, and way more modern.” To that end, Ms. Wang mixed propriety with a bit of coyness in a collection highlighted by filmy collared gowns, billowing sleeves and wispy Empress Josephine silhouettes.",
		"7" : "Elie Saab, Sachin & Babi, Carolina Herrera and Ines Di Santo, who only a year ago espoused steamy sensuality, were also among those who seemed, at a glance, to be celebrating a return to tradition but were in fact executing a radical about-face.",
		"8" : "Like Ms. Di Santo, many designers abandoned the provocative cutouts, plummeting necklines and transparencies they once favored for high collars, covered arms, bodice-concealing wraps, hooded capes, gloves and other totems of bridal decorum.",
		"9" : "Few entirely relinquished the deep V-necklines, strapless tops and slit-to-the-thigh dresses that remain best sellers. But a proliferation of pared-down dresses and, conversely, traditionally frothy ball gowns, seems reflective of a recent nostalgia for the prosperous, if somewhat uptight, Reagan-era 1980s, a period punctuated, in the pop culture at least, by the fairy-tale wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.",
		"10" : "For Monique Lhuillier, the ideal is a timeless, elegant and wedding-appropriate look. “Remember,” she said, “you are surrounded that day by family and friends.” As for sheerness and nudity, she added, “that wave has passed. I hope one day my daughter will feel the same way.”",
		"11" : "Ms. Lhuillier’s designs underscored the new mood, supplying her demure brides with point d’esprit lace capelets and matching gloves.",
		"12" : "Bridal week wasn’t all candy-box confections, though. Some collections bowed to an unbridled romanticism that bordered on decadence. Ms. Wang injected a hint of goth-tinged darkness, embellishing an otherwise streamlined cream-colored gown with an outrageously oversize black corsage; she complemented a bias-cut dress with an austere black cape.",
		"13" : "Mrs. Herrera accented the waistline of a prim lace top and cropped trousers with an incongruously sassy black silk sash. Naeem Khan introduced a ghostly element in the shape of a gossamer hooded cover-up.",
		"14" : "Others like Viktor & Rolf chose to showcase freshness and purity, balancing an understated cap-sleeve top with a minimally embellished, if ultrawide, skirt. Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia of Oscar de la Renta showed a tailored white trouser suit with nothing fancier than a wide silver cummerbund.",
		"15" : "Ms. Leonard suggested that this season’s shift in tone may have less to do with making a sociopolitical statement than with acknowledging a taste for escapism. “Last year’s aggressive sexiness has given way to something more magical, dreamy, otherworldly,” she said.",
		"16" : "The contemporary bride, she said, is comfortable with her femininity and coming to terms with the notion that it’s fine to show a tender side. “Why not, if that’s what she wants? It is, after all, her wedding day.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "President Trump eagerly repaid his campaign debt to the National Rifle Association on Friday by appearing at its annual convention in Atlanta. Last year, candidate Trump benefited greatly from the N.R.A.’s endorsement and $30 million worth of campaign support; the N.R.A., in turn, relished Mr. Trump’s fear-inducing agenda, which led to greater arms sales among more and more ordinary Americans.",
		"2" : "Interestingly, however, now that Mr. Trump’s in the White House, gun sales have been leveling off, gun company stocks are dropping and industry workers are being laid off. One reason is that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have departed the political scene, thereby depriving gun marketeers and the N.R.A. of the selling point that caused an eight-year binge of gun sales to buyers who feared tight new regulations.",
		"3" : "And binge it was, with the industry growing from 166,000 employees to 301,000 in the Obama years, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. But since the election, “there is no political incentive to buy guns,” Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland, told CNN Money, leaving gun makers and retailers “a victim of their own success.”",
		"4" : "Americans concerned for public safety can only hope that the decline will continue as the nation’s gun carnage seems likely to produce another year of 30,000-plus deaths. Mr. Trump himself has displayed no sense of responsibility to offer prescriptions for how that toll might be reduced through gun safety. Rather, in his appearance Friday, he stuck to the red-meat stuff expected at a convention where hundreds of companies displayed an astonishing 15 acres of guns and firearms paraphernalia for thousands of conventioneers.",
		"5" : "“You came through for me and I am going to come through for you,” Mr. Trump declared, as gun owners cheered. Exactly how he might do that remains to be seen, although the president pointed to his decision to ease federal restrictions against the use of lead bullets on federal hunting grounds. Lead ammunition remnants prove highly toxic in the animal food chain and had been restricted.",
		"6" : "Beyond that, Mr. Trump did not touch on such N.R.A. priorities as the gun lobby’s push in Congress to expand its “concealed carry” campaign of gun ownership by requiring states to recognize different gun permits issued in other states. This is currently the gun industry’s main hope for a sales rebound — weakening permit laws to see more guns in more people’s pockets in more public places.",
		"7" : "Gun safety research indicates concealed-carry gun owners are responsible for far more homicides and suicides than self-defense standoffs against criminals. But Mr. Trump, who used to favor strong gun controls, has endorsed the N.R.A.’s vigilante approach as a safety measure. “If I’m in that room and let’s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns,” he hypothesized as a candidate, “we’re going to do a lot better because there’s going to be a shootout.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "HOUSTON — They say everything is bigger in Texas. And certainly, the saying holds true for the state’s feral hog population.",
		"2" : "At 2.5 million it’s the nation’s largest, and is growing exponentially as the sows birth litters of five to six piglets twice a year and those piglets can start reproducing before they are even a year old.",
		"3" : "Brought to Texas by Spanish explorers in 1542, wild pigs here cause an estimated $52 million a year in damage as the bristly backed hooligans smash through fences, decimate crops, eat baby livestock, dig up internet and water lines, ruin golf courses and cause car accidents when they dart across the road. They also carry diseases that have the potential to devastate cattle and domesticated pig operations, as well as infect humans.",
		"4" : "And so the state’s agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, who made his name in the State Legislature sponsoring the “pork chopper bill” allowing Texans to shoot wild pigs from helicopters, now wants to use chemical warfare to bring about what he calls the “feral hog apocalypse.” The poison? Warfarin (a.k.a. Coumadin), the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant, or blood thinner, for humans.",
		"5" : "His department issued an emergency rule in February fast-tracking the use of warfarin-laced bait, sold under the brand name Kaput Feral Hog Bait. The rule stipulated that, at least initially, sale and distribution of the product, which was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency a month earlier, be limited to licensed pest control professionals. “I didn’t want some yahoo getting a 50-pound bag and dumping it on the ground,” Mr. Miller said.",
		"6" : "Texan hunters, who smear on face paint and wear night-vision goggles to track and take out the nocturnal pigs by land and by air, have pushed back, convincing a state district judge in March to issue a monthlong restraining order against use of the warfarin bait. They also lobbied for a bill calling for more testing, which has passed the Texas House and is pending in the Senate.",
		"7" : "The outcry prompted the hog bait’s manufacturer, Scimetrics, to withdraw its Texas registration on Tuesday. The company says it can’t afford to fight the legal battles that seem likely, but opponents say the move is designed merely to table the bill requiring more research. Since the State Legislature meets every other year, once the body adjourns on May 29, the company could theoretically reregister. And now that the restraining order has expired, it could simply put the product back on the market.",
		"8" : "Wild pigs provide hunters with a food source and a significant revenue stream, as slaughterhouses will pay $30 to $180 per pig. The slaughterhouses sell the cheaper cuts to pet food companies and the better ones to high-end restaurants. But it’s unlikely chefs will buy poisoned pork belly, bacon and short ribs, even if they are organic and free range.",
		"9" : "“If Kaput or any warfarin hog bait is allowed, I cannot guarantee the meat I sell doesn’t have the drug in it,” said Will Herring, a hog hunter in Hubbard, Tex., near Waco, who last year founded Wild Boar Meats, which buys feral pigs and sells the meat to pet food companies. “It will kill my business,” which he said processes about 5,000 pigs a month. Also a lawyer, Mr. Herring filed the lawsuit that prompted the restraining order, supported by the Texas Hog Hunters Association and the Environmental Defense Fund.",
		"10" : "Both hunters and environmentalists worry about collateral damage. The warfarin-laced bait is dispensed by a contraption that works a bit like a giant Pez dispenser; only a determined pig should be able to trigger the release. But video of a black bear ripping into the device recently caused Louisiana officials to halt plans to follow Texas’ lead in allowing use of the Kaput product. Moreover, pigs are messy eaters and inevitably litter the bait around, where other wildlife and pets can get it. And of course, there is the danger to humans, who may consume pork from a pig who ate the bait.",
		"11" : "How can a common drug also be a poison? In fact, even when administered therapeutically, warfarin, which is widely prescribed to reduce the risk of blood clots and subsequent stroke, is the leading cause of adverse drug reactions requiring hospitalization among older Americans.",
		"12" : "“Warfarin can be tricky to prescribe,” said Dr. Greg Marcus, director of clinical research in cardiology at the University of San Francisco School of Medicine. The drug works, he said, by inhibiting vitamin K synthesis, which in turn inhibits the production of proteins in the blood that control bleeding. Genetics, diet and even bacteria in the gut can affect how people respond to the drug. Some people can take two milligrams and hemorrhage, while others can take 10 milligrams to little effect. And one person’s safe dose one day can become a toxic dose the next.",
		"13" : "“You have to do a lot of blood testing to monitor and fine tune the dose,” Dr. Marcus said.",
		"14" : "Before relinquishing the registration last week, Richard Poché, the president of Scimetrics, said a lethal dose for pigs is three milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Since the bait contains 0.005 percent warfarin, he said, pigs would have to eat about 2.7 kilograms, or about six pounds, to die.",
		"15" : "But judging from the experience of wildlife officials who experimented with warfarin to poison feral hogs in Australia in the 1980s, it seems pigs are a lot like humans, in that the toxic dose is hard to peg.",
		"16" : "According to Jim Hone, an emeritus professor of wildlife management at the University of Canberra in Australia who participated in that research, animal welfare concerns led them to stop using warfarin. “It took on average seven to 10 days for the animals to die,” suffering all the while from internal bleeding, he said. “It didn’t seem humane.” He also said there is not enough evidence to discount the risk posed to wildlife such as deer and birds that may eat the poison or predators and scavenger species such as mountain lions and buzzards that might eat the poisoned pigs.",
		"17" : "Warfarin is still used in Australia as a rat poison, just as it is in the United States, though it has become less popular because rats seem to develop a tolerance for it (which pharmacologists said would most likely be the case for pigs). It was approved in the United States first as a rat poison in 1952 and as an anticoagulant for humans two years later. Warfarin was initially discovered in the 1920s after cattle started dying from internal bleeding, and the cause was traced to moldy clover silage. The responsible compound was later identified and synthesized to make the drug.",
		"18" : "People who take warfarin have increasingly begun to question whether it’s wise, given that small doses can kill 300-pound feral hogs. But doctors still urge its use to reduce the risk of stroke. Dr. Marcus said for those with atrial fibrillation, a kind of irregular heartbeat, closely monitored warfarin dosing reduces the risk of stroke from about 5 percent to 1 percent a year. There are newer anticoagulants on the market, but they, too, have worrisome side effects. The newer drugs are also often not covered by insurance because they are so much more expensive than warfarin.",
		"19" : "For his part, Commissioner Miller, a former rodeo champion who advised the  Trump campaign on agriculture, has framed the withdrawal of the Kaput product as a disconnect between rural and urban Texas. “The hard-working folks who turn the dirt and work from sunup to sundown have fallen victim to lawyers, environmental radicals and the misinformed,” he said in a statement. “Once again, politically correct urban media hacks and naysayers win out against the rural folks who produce the food and fiber everyone needs.”"

		"2" : "That was when Donald Trump visited and made remarks at the C.I.A. He had fences to mend with the American intelligence community, whose failure to fall fawningly in line with his nascent administration had prompted him to compare them to Nazis. He stood before a wall of stars that commemorated lives sacrificed for country.",
		"3" : "And what message did he bring? What manner did he summon?",
		"4" : "He lied, saying that the media had invented his feud with the agency. He lashed out at suggestions that his inaugural crowds hadn’t been the biggest and most orgiastic. To top it all off, he crowed about how often he’d claimed the cover of Time magazine, because who isn’t fascinated by that? Who doesn’t want a running tally? Whose heart doesn’t beat faster when Trump yet again ponders the glory of Trump?",
		"5" : "He was president at that point. Vindicated. Inaugurated. He could decide to be big. But he chose to be small, and it was clear then, if it hadn’t been before, that there would be no pivot to dignity, which was either beyond his capabilities or outside his interests.",
		"6" : "Most historians, political analysts and other observers are taking stock of him at this presidential mile marker in terms of his legislative cul-de-sacs, his policy flips and flops, his executive actions and his foreign policy, such as it is.",
		"7" : "But that minimizes and, yes, normalizes the most distinctive aspect of Trump’s presidency, which is his complete and consistent rejection of the conventional etiquette of the office — of public comportment that speaks to the best in us, not the worst.",
		"8" : "The other presidents in my lifetime have at least done a pantomime of the qualities that we try to instill in children: humility, honesty, magnanimity, generosity. Even Richard Nixon took his stabs at these. Trump makes a proud and almost ceaseless mockery of them.",
		"9" : "And while I worry plenty that he’ll achieve some of his most ill-conceived policy goals, I’m just as fearful that he has already succeeded in changing forever the expected demeanor of someone in public office.",
		"10" : "All around me people shrug and yawn at his latest petulant tirade, his newest baseless tweet, his freshest assertion that the numbers that the rest of us see are just optical illusions and he really did win the popular vote. Even outrage grows boring, and it begins to feel pointless: His obnoxiousness isn’t going to get him impeached.",
		"11" : "Besides, the mendacity, the grandiosity: That’s just Trump being Trump. It’s old news by now. Many readers will get this far in this column and wonder why I and other naysayers don’t just let it go and cut him a break. As if we’re stuck on piddling things and his bearing is nothing more than peculiar.",
		"12" : "But when something no longer provokes remark, it becomes unremarkable, and the road from there to acceptable is a short one.",
		"13" : "In her own warped way, Kellyanne Conway grasped this earlier and better than almost anyone else, giving nearly perfect expression to it. She was at a Harvard University forum in December, deconstructing the presidential election, and Jake Tapper asked her if Trump’s splenetic tweets, such as his unsupported assertion that Hillary Clinton had benefited from millions of illegal votes, constituted presidential behavior.",
		"14" : "“Well, he’s the president-elect,” she said. “So that’s presidential behavior, yes.” She was dead right, inasmuch as our sense of how presidents can and should conduct themselves is established by the conduct of presidents so far. From the moment Trump joined the long line of our commanders in chief, he began to change the terms and the tenor of the job.",
		"15" : "My glasses aren’t rose-colored and my recall is clear: The presidency was degraded plenty by his predecessors, more than a few of whom had their own stripes and streaks of rashness, pettiness and cupidity. There were tortured psyches and tawdry doings before Trump. I haven’t forgotten Monica Lewinsky or the Lincoln Bedroom.",
		"16" : "But who among the presidents of the last half-century has been so publicly cavalier about conflicts of interest, so blithe about getting away with whatever grifts he could, so lavishly meanspirited and so proudly rude? Who among those presidents made so little concession to decorum?",
		"17" : "Who stooped so low, on the campaign trail or in office, as to ridicule a disabled journalist and make light of a prisoner of war’s ordeal? Who talked incessantly about how heroic his election was, summoning more energy for self-congratulation than he ever exhibited for the praise of others?",
		"18" : "Who taunted his adversaries with such abandon? Who made such a spectacle of his grievances that he invented a phenomenon: sore winning?",
		"19" : "Trump’s fans can excuse and explain all of this, and there are glimmers of merit in some of what they say:",
		"20" : "He is owning up to, and not laboring to disguise, the emotional currents that move most politicians. He has honed his vanity into a kind of weapon, so it’s useful if not honorable. There’s a candor to the way he does things; a boldness and an authenticity, too. Politicians who feigned rectitude didn’t take the country where it needed to go. Why not give a shot to one who doesn’t bother much with the pretense?",
		"21" : "Now he has his shot, and I continue to root for him to govern wisely, because we’re the real losers if he doesn’t. I’m heartened by occasional signs that he’s learning and by flickers of flexibility.",
		"22" : "But I’m sickened by the lack of deference that he still shows toward traits that we’ve long and rightly extolled. It’s one thing to fall short of them, as so many presidents have. It’s quite another to step onto the inaugural stage, put your hand on the Bible and then go out of your way to belittle the past presidents who are sitting, respectfully, just a few feet away.",
		"23" : "That’s what Trump did on the afternoon before he went to the C.I.A., and on both occasions he wasn’t just assaulting propriety. He was fashioning a new model of leadership. He was saying that it could strut and seethe and whine like this. He was consigning an entire roster of virtues to the junkyard of the quaint.",
		"24" : "They remain there 100 days later — but not, I hope, forever."

		"1" : "Tens of thousands of Haitians living in the United States are facing an ominous deadline. The temporary protected status that has allowed them to live and work here legally since 2010 — the year an earthquake devastated their country and left them unable to return safely home — is set to expire on July 22. Unless the homeland security secretary, John Kelly, decides to renew it, about 50,000 Haitians will lose their welcome here and be vulnerable to deportation.",
		"2" : "A reasonable person might say: The United States couldn’t do that. Haiti has made only a fitful recovery from the quake, which all but destroyed the national government and left hundreds of thousands homeless, and ensuing disasters have deepened the country’s misery. Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 ravaged Haiti’s southwest peninsula, killing more than a thousand people and laying waste to villages and farmland. A cholera epidemic that erupted after the earthquake has not been subdued.",
		"3" : "These acute crises, laid atop chronic poverty and political turmoil, make Haiti a fragile place. The sudden return of tens of thousands of expatriates would be yet another damaging blow. Better those Haitians remain in the United States, where they can be safe and work and send money home, and not further burden their traumatized homeland.",
		"4" : "That is a reasonable conclusion. But not everyone in the Trump administration recognizes it. The acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, James McCament, wrote to Mr. Kelly this month recommending that temporary protected status be ended next January.",
		"5" : "“Although Hurricane Matthew recently caused a deterioration of conditions in Haiti’s southwest peninsula,” he wrote, “over all, circumstances in the country have continued on an upward trajectory since the 2010 earthquake.”",
		"6" : "Give that man a prize for bureaucratic understatement: “Deterioration of conditions” is a brutally antiseptic way to describe a Category 4 hurricane that left so much death, sickness and hunger in its wake. In fairness, Mr. McCament’s memo does acknowledge many of the other afflictions that would argue for temporary protected status, including homelessness, gender-based violence, food insecurity, deep deficiencies in sanitation and health care, and a weak government.",
		"7" : "And yet it reached the wrong conclusion. Only in December, in President Barack Obama’s administration, the State Department examined the same circumstances and recommended that the Haitians be allowed to remain.",
		"8" : "Temporary protected status is where United States law joins practicality and humanitarian compassion. Mr. Kelly may make his decision by May 23, 60 days before the expiration date. Before he decides to send them back — and, given the Trump administration’s coldblooded approach to destitute migrants the world over, who knows what he will do? — we hope he considers what advantage there could possibly be in sowing greater instability in Haiti, deepening its poverty and subjecting so many people to such pointless cruelty. Rather than make a desperate situation intolerably worse, he should extend America’s welcome to the Haitians once again."

		"1" : "BERKELEY, Calif. — My dad and stepmom live in Mobile, Ala., and spend their vacation time an hour’s drive away in Orange Beach, Ala. This means that, throughout my life, I have regularly vacationed there as well.",
		"2" : "Whenever I tell people in Berkeley, Calif., where I live, that I’m headed to the beach in Alabama, they are shocked. Most people outside of the Gulf Coast have no idea that Alabama has beaches — even though if you look at a map of Alabama, there is a part of it that looks as if it should belong to Florida. There is even a bar at the Alabama-Florida border that commemorates this fact. That bar is named the Flora-Bama. (Calling it the Ala-Lorida would just be ridiculous.)",
		"3" : "I often try to convince my wife, Melissa, that we and our two daughters should vacation in Orange Beach more often. I try to persuade friends to come, too. It is the perfect fun-and-sun vacation. We stay across the street from the beach, which is perfect for my wife. The resort has an old-school arcade room with one of those claw machines, which is perfect for our older daughter, even though she has never won anything from it. And it has a lazy-river pool, where you can sit in an inner tube and let the underwater jets push you around while thinking that you may be experiencing the pinnacle of human achievement. That’s perfect for me.",
		"4" : "But no one has taken us up on the invitation yet, because of one problematic word: Alabama. Nobody I know from the Bay Area has any interest in purposefully spending time in Alabama. Florida, maybe, but Alabama? Nah, that’s a hard pass.",
		"5" : "I have discovered that when you are black, saying “I’m headed to the South” to someone, especially a white person who is not from the South, is like saying, “I’m headed to my own lynching and I decided to bring the rope just to make it easier on the Klansmen.”",
		"6" : "It is one of my enduring frustrations with this country. People live in their part of the Union, and if they don’t travel a lot, then there is a tendency to believe that the other parts of America couldn’t possibly be as American as their part. You can see it in the way people in the South scrunch up their faces when they hear words like “New York,” “Chicago” and “challah.” And you can also see it in the way people on the coast narrow their eyes when they hear words like “Louisiana,” “Kentucky” and “pork rinds.”",
		"7" : "Sometimes it gets even worse. Some people think that the things going on in other parts are actually anti-American.",
		"8" : "I’m happy that I know how to speak “Southern.” I spent a lot of time in Alabama throughout my life. I even lived there for part of junior high and high school, so I learned the true beauty and mastery of the Southern dialect. “Y’all” is one of the greatest and most useful words ever invented. Saying you are “fixing to get ready to go” is useful, because it is a state most of us are regularly in, even if we don’t know it. It means you are thinking about maybe leaving. That is me, every time I try to go out of the house.",
		"9" : "Southern is more than just a language. It’s also about understanding someone’s intentions. There are things people in the South say to me that I just let go, but if someone outside the South says the same thing, I’ll think to myself, “Well, I’ll be telling this story onstage tonight.”",
		"10" : "I was in a Walgreens in Northern California once, back when I still had long dreadlocks. The cashier, a white woman, asked as she was ringing me up, “Can I touch your hair?” When you have dreadlocks you start to get used to this question. I said, “No, you can’t touch my hair,” but I said it with a smile so that we could both move on without the situation getting weirder than it already was.",
		"11" : "A few months later, in Mobile, I was at a Krispy Kreme with my dad. A different white woman asked the same question and I said, “Sure.” I could tell that she was taking a chance by asking. It felt like more than the idle curiosity or simple objectification that I felt in Northern California. Maybe some part of me hoped that she would touch my hair, her eyes would glaze over, and then like Neo from “The Matrix” she would say something like, “I now understand how the institution of slavery is directly connected the current struggle of black people in America, and I also recognize white people’s part in that … also, I know kung fu.” That didn’t happen. But she did give me an extra doughnut.",
		"12" : "Those types of interactions prepared me for my current career, where I travel the country and ask (and occasionally answer) “dumb questions.” When I created a pilot for CNN called “The United Shades of America,” I tried to roll all of that experience up into an hour of television. I went to Kentucky and talked to the Ku Klux Klan.",
		"13" : "When the episode aired back in a distant time called April 2016, the major criticism I heard was: “Why are you giving the K.K.K. a platform? We already know the K.K.K. is awful.” Well, my mom taught me that there is no such thing as too much knowledge. And as gobsmacked as my liberal friends were by Donald Trump’s victory, they now know that they definitely didn’t know as much about America as they thought.",

		"1" : "Here we go again. The Federal Communications Commission, now led by an anti-regulation ideologue appointed by President Trump, wants to gut the net neutrality rules that keep powerful broadband companies from calling the shots on the internet, at the expense of consumers.",
		"2" : "Under the cynical guise of “restoring internet freedom,” the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, wants to give big telecom companies carte blanche to treat the content of their subsidiaries and partners more favorably than information from other companies — a practice that AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are already starting to employ. They would also be able to demand fees from companies like Netflix and YouTube to deliver videos and other content to customers.",
		"3" : "If the commission, which has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, approves Mr. Pai’s proposal, there will be little stopping the broadband industry from squelching competition, limiting consumer choice and raising prices. The previous F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, helped put the rules Mr. Pai is attacking in place in 2015, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld them last year.",
		"4" : "Mr. Pai argues that existing regulations are hurting the internet. He said that the 12 largest internet service providers reduced investment by 5.6 percent between 2014 and 2016 because the net neutrality rules were too onerous. But he is cherry-picking data to make his case. Free Press, a public-interest group that supports net neutrality, found that total investment by publicly traded broadband companies increased 5.3 percent between 2013-14 and 2015-16.",
		"5" : "Large telecommunications companies have been raking in profits in recent years. And they have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions — not something you see from an industry that is withering from senseless regulations. Charter spent more than $65 billion last year to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. AT&T bought DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015 and is trying to buy Time Warner, the media company, for $85 billion.",
		"6" : "Not only is Mr. Pai’s lament for the broadband industry based on alternative facts, it misses the bigger point. Net neutrality is meant to benefit the internet and the economy broadly, not just the broadband industry. That means the commission ought to consider the impact the regulations have on consumers and businesses. In particular, the commission has a responsibility to protect people with few or no choices; most Americans have access to just one or two companies for residential service and just four big operators for wireless.",
		"7" : "Mr. Pai argues that if the Wheeler rules are revoked, some safeguards will remain. For example, he says, broadband companies would refrain from blocking or slowing the content of competitors. He has not said how he would ensure that. But the F.C.C. is considering using voluntary commitments from the industry.",
		"8" : "Under that approach, officials at the Federal Trade Commission would have the power to fine or sue companies that make pledges and then fail to uphold them. But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.",
		"9" : "Under Mr. Pai’s proposal, broadband companies would probably use their gatekeeping position to give themselves a leg up. AT&T, for example, already encourages people to buy the streaming video service of its DirecTV subsidiary by allowing customers to watch it on AT&T’s wireless network without incurring data charges. Verizon and Comcast have similar practices. Over time, such corporate policies will make it harder for smaller companies to compete with the telecom giants.",
		"10" : "Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai’s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.",
		"11" : "Smaller firms and start-ups — some of which may never get started — will not be as lucky.",

		"1" : "MARIETTA, GA. — Shortly before President Trump’s swearing-in, I spoke to Steve Cohen, a liberal congressman from Tennessee, about his decision to skip the ceremony. Mr. Cohen said his horror of Mr. Trump almost made him understand how Tea Partyers might have felt under President Barack Obama. “I want my country back!” he said, echoing the right’s rallying cry.",
		"2" : "One hundred days into his administration, President Trump has few legislative achievements to his name. But he has forced liberals to experience the near-apocalyptic revulsion that conservatives have often felt toward Democratic presidents. In doing so, he has unwittingly created a new movement in American politics, as Democrats channel the sort of all-encompassing outrage that has long fueled grass-roots conservatism.",
		"3" : "For decades, Democrats have envied the Republicans’ passionate, locally attuned base. It turns out that what Democrats were missing was a sense of existential emergency. Mr. Trump has provided it.",
		"4" : "Objectively, there’s no comparison between the conservative demonization of Mr. Obama and the progressive case against Mr. Trump. People on the right saw Mr. Obama as a Kenyan-born secret Muslim with a hidden agenda to hobble American power and a health care reform plan to establish “death panels.” None of that is true.",
		"5" : "People on the left believe that Mr. Trump has incited hatred against minorities, and boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. Democrats think that the president and his family are blatantly profiting off the presidency and that he welcomed the help of a hostile foreign power during the election. All this is grounded in fact.",
		"6" : "Facts aside, there is an emotional symmetry between the conservative reaction to past Democratic presidents and the liberal response to Mr. Trump. Suddenly, left-of-center people get what it’s like to have a president who is the living negation of all they value, a president who makes them ashamed before their children and terrified for their future. Now they’ve learned what it’s like to worry that malevolent foreign conspirators are manipulating American affairs. And these feelings, it turns out, are an extremely powerful goad to political action.",

I was there to report on the special congressional election to fill Mr. Price’s seat. Ahead of the April 18 open primary, a Democrat, Jon Ossoff, was showing unexpected strength. In the event, he only narrowly failed to win the district outright, and goes forward to a June runoff against the leading Republican vote-getter.",
		"8" : "Lots of outsiders were paying attention to the race; Mr. Ossoff raised a staggering $8 million for what was widely seen as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s presidency. On the ground, though, the people powering the campaign were locals, many of them previously apolitical suburban women shocked into action by the presidential election.",
		"9" : "In November’s aftermath, Amy Nosek, a 42-year-old stay-at-home mother of two living in an affluent Atlanta suburb, sank into depression, though she’d never been depressed before. “I didn’t even want to go pick up my kids from the school bus because I didn’t want to talk to the other parents, or see anybody,” she told me.",
		"10" : "As an antidote, she and a friend founded a local chapter of Indivisible, the network of anti-Trump groups that sprang up after the election. Soon, they were consumed by political organizing. “We’re working all the time,” Ms. Nosek said. “Sometimes, I fall asleep on the couch at 9 or 10 p.m., and then I wake up at 2 and I’m working until 4.”",
		"11" : "Like her, most of the activists I met were new to electoral politics. Some had not even known what district they lived in or who their local representatives were. Now, thanks to Mr. Trump, they were obsessed.",
		"12" : "I was struck by how their stories echoed tales of conservative political awakening. Until the rise of Mr. Trump, wave after wave of right-wing Republican activism was driven by comfortable but morally scandalized suburbanites, particularly suburban women. Shaken by what they saw as liberal attacks on beloved institutions — family, church, law enforcement, private property — they organized politically, and found meaning and community in it.",
		"13" : "This phenomenon long predates the Tea Party movement that so galvanized Republican voters for the 2010 midterm elections. In her 2001 study, “Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right,” Lisa McGirr described how Orange County, Calif., became ground zero for militant conservatism in the early 1960s: “At living room bridge clubs, at backyard barbecues, and at kitchen coffee klatches, the middle-class men and women of Orange County ‘awakened’ to what they perceived as the threats of communism and liberalism.”",
		"14" : "Campaigning to save the nuclear family from the depredations of the Equal Rights Amendment, Phyllis Schlafly induced housewives to become local activists.",
		"15" : "“These were local women whom most politicians feared to alienate,” wrote Mrs. Schlafly’s biographer, Donald Critchlow, “because these women talked politics, volunteered in political campaigns and wore political buttons when they came to meetings.”",
		"16" : "Democrats have their passionate local leaders, but they’ve lacked a Schlafly-style nationwide network of kitchen-table activists. And outside big cities, the party has allowed its local infrastructure to whither.",
		"17" : "Mr. Trump is changing all that.",
		"18" : "For many Democrats, his election was a traumatic event that demands a response, lest their country become unrecognizable. Democratic women, especially, find it intolerable and degrading to call Mr. Trump their president.",
		"19" : "“The story we hear again and again and again is that it’s moms and other women who came together after the election and said, ‘This is totally unacceptable,’ ” said Ezra Levin, one of Indivisible’s founders.",
		"20" : "Alan Abramowitz, a professor at Emory University who studies political polarization, said of Democratic antipathy to Mr. Trump, “If anything, I think it’s gotten stronger since he became president because the stuff he’s been doing has just exacerbated those negative feelings.”",
		"21" : "There are dangers for Democrats in this absolute loathing. Hatred obliterates nuance and fosters conspiracy theories, a particular temptation when the country is sorting through real evidence of the Trump campaign’s worrisome foreign entanglements. It’s probably not good for America that every election — even an off-year special election in placid suburban Georgia — feels like a struggle over the future of civilization.",
		"22" : "Yet, as the right has repeatedly shown over the past 50 years, disgust is politically potent. Nothing, Professor Abramowitz said, works as well as what political scientists call “negative affect” — intense dislike — for “getting people energized and mobilized.”",
		"23" : "So far, the lesson of this presidency is that when it comes to building political power, love does not, in fact, trump hate."

		"1" : "EVERY surge of right-wing populism confronts voters with a different dilemma. In the Brexit referendum, the risk was the policy, not the politicians. Voting to leave the European Union was not a vote to make Nigel Farage prime minister; it was a vote for a leap into the unknown, but one supervised by mainstream Tory leaders.",
		"2" : "In the case of Donald Trump, there was risk in the policy, but the central question was always about the candidate himself: about his fitness for the office, his ability to execute its basic duties, the effect that his demagogy and self-dealing would have on civic norms.",
		"3" : "In the case of Marine Le Pen — presently facing off against Emmanuel Macron, the John Lindsay of the Eurocrats, for the presidency of France — the main risk is her party. To elevate her to the presidency is to empower the National Front, an organization that despite years of renovation and attempted purges — extending to Le Pen’s own father, Jean-Marie — still includes figures like her successor (briefly; he just resigned) as its leader, who appears to have done the “I’m just asking questions” thing about the gas chambers.",
		"4" : "Parties matter, their histories and undercurrents matter, and the Front’s Vichy taint is a good reason to prefer a world where a Le Pen never occupies the Élysée Palace.",
		"5" : "At the same time, individual personalities and their policies also matter — and there the case for #NeverLePen seems weaker in important ways than the case for #NeverTrump.",
		"6" : "To begin with, nobody seriously doubts Le Pen’s competence, her command of policy, her ability to serve as president without turning the office into a reality-TV thunderdome. Trump’s inability to master his own turbulent emotions is not an issue with his Gallic counterpart.",
		"7" : "Nor is there much evidence that Le Pen herself draws any personal inspiration from the Vichy right. However incomplete the project, she is the reason that her party has ejected Vichyites and disavowed anti-Semitism and moved toward the French mainstream on many issues.",
		"8" : "This has been done, of course, in the hopes of gaining power. But that is how the purging of poisons always happens, and being disowned by one’s father is a quite costly and dramatic act of political purgation.",
		"9" : "Some argue that Le Pen has simply replaced anti-Semitism with Islamophobia. But her attacks on Islamic fundamentalism and her defense of a strict public secularism have been echoed by many mainstream French politicians. An argument for quarantining her perspective would apply to Nicolas Sarkozy or François Fillon, not just her.",
		"10" : "Over all, the politician that Le Pen has obviously strained to imitate is not her father or Marshal Pétain, but Charles de Gaulle — the de Gaulle who fiercely opposed European political integration, who granted Algeria its independence in part because he doubted France could absorb millions of Muslim immigrants, whose “France First” worldview consistently gave other Western leaders fits.",
		"11" : "Even the most controversial utterance of Le Pen’s campaign, a denial of widespread French complicity in the deportation of French Jews, was deeply Gaullist: An insistence that the true France existed with de Gaulle’s government-in-exile, not Pétain’s regime.",
		"12" : "This is comforting myth, of course, and perhaps de Gaulle’s style of nationalism is too chauvinist and mystical for our era.",
		"13" : "But on the other hand, our era’s “enlightened” governance has produced an out-of-touch eurozone elite lashed to a destructive common currency, and an experiment in mass immigration that has changed French society faster than integration can do its necessary work.",
		"14" : "These are the same sort of issues that helped Trump win the presidency, but in the European context the challenges are more severe and the populist critique more compelling.",
		"15" : "There is no American equivalent to the epic disaster of the euro, a form of German imperialism with the struggling parts of Europe as its subjects. There is no American equivalent to the challenge of immigrant-assimilation now facing France — no equivalent of the domestic terror threat, the rise of Islamist anti-Semitism, the immigrant enclaves as worlds unto themselves.",
		"16" : "Which means that while much of Trump’s notional agenda was an overreaction to the country’s problems, some of Le Pen’s controversial positions are straightforwardly correct.",
		"17" : "She is right that France as a whole, recent immigrants as well as natives, would benefit from a sustained mass-immigration halt.",
		"18" : "She is right that the European Union has given too much unaccountable power to Brussels and Berlin and favored financial interests over ordinary citizens.",
		"19" : "And while many of her economic prescriptions are half-baked, her overarching critique of the euro is correct: Her country and her continent would be better off without it.",
		"20" : "The French will presumably vote against her nonetheless. They will choose Macron, a callow creature of a failed consensus, over the possibility that the repulsive party’s standard-bearer might be right.",
		"21" : "That decision will be understandable. But it’s the kind of choice that has a way of getting offered again and again, until the public finally makes a different one."

	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/sunday/lessons-from-100-days-of-president-trump.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "Here are a dozen things we have learned in President Trump’s first 100 days.",
		"2" : "1. Trump has had the worst beginning of any president since, oh, perhaps William Henry Harrison (who died a month after his inauguration). Trump has had no legislative triumphs, and he has by far the lowest public approval of any new president in polling history. Large majorities say he is not honest, does not keep promises and does not care about ordinary people.",
		"3" : "2. Trump distinguishes himself in one area: incompetence. The debacle of the travel ban was followed by the collapse of the G.O.P. health care bill, and I doubt we’ll ever see passage of a tax reform package, a health bill or even a major infrastructure spending bill. Trump has made no trips abroad (at this juncture, Barack Obama had visited nine countries), and he has fewer than half as many nominees confirmed for senior positions as Obama did at this point.",
		"4" : "3. New presidents typically grow into the job, but Trump remains a bully and a charlatan. In my career, I’ve never known a national politician as mendacious, ill informed, bombastic and dangerous as Trump. His tweets are as immature as ever, and The Washington Post calculates that he has issued 452 false or misleading claims since assuming office, churning them out at a rate of more than one every six hours around the clock (no wonder he seems so busy!).",
		"5" : "4. The opposition to Trump has been ineffective in reaching Trump voters, and he remains deeply popular with his base. Only 2 percent of Trump voters say they regret their choice in November, and an ABC/Washington Post poll suggested that if 2016 voters filled out their ballots today, Trump would be elected by the popular vote as well as by the electoral vote. Even more people say that the Democratic Party is out of touch with ordinary voters than say the same of the Republican Party. Trump’s popularity among Republicans means that the liberal aim of removing Trump by impeachment or the 25th Amendment is probably fantasy — and all this should prompt some hard reflection among progressives.",
		"6" : "5. Trump systematically betrays his supporters. Elected in part on working-class anger at elites, he keeps proposing giant tax cuts for the rich financed by cutting health care for the needy, and his tax “plan” would in effect borrow from China to reward billionaires like himself. His “deregulation” includes letting chemical companies peddle an insecticide, chlorpyrifos, linked to brain damage in children.",
		"7" : "6. Trump has built a colossal swamp in Washington, hiring lobbyists to craft policies governing the very companies that previously paid them. To cover up abuses, the White House issues secret waivers of its own ethics rules! The denizens of this swamp are also like nothing previously seen in the White House: One counterterrorism aide, Sebastian Gorka, founded an extremist political party in Hungary and allegedly has ties (which he denies) to a Nazi-allied group there.",
		"8" : "7. Bless the American people: Scapegoating and bigotry carry a political price. Trump has demonized some of the most vulnerable people — refugees and unauthorized immigrants — but large majorities of Americans disapprove of his policies on immigration (57 percent to 41 percent, according a CNN poll).",
		"9" : "8. After initially tussling with allies like Australia and Mexico, and apparently refusing to shake Angela Merkel’s hand for a photo, Trump has partially adapted to reality on foreign policy, abandoning his positions on two Chinas, on China’s currency and on the Iran nuclear program. He has replaced an awful national security adviser (Michael Flynn) with a good one (H. R. McMaster) and now has a respectable national security team.",
		"10" : "9. Perhaps the greatest single risk of a Trump presidency is what he calls a “major, major conflict” erupting on the Korean Peninsula. I don’t think this is likely, but it would be cataclysmic. The problem is that Trump’s existing policy won’t succeed in getting North Korea to give up its nuclear stockpile — and one can’t help worrying when two inexperienced and impulsive leaders face off.",
		"11" : "10. Democrats should be careful to avoid Trump Derangement Syndrome. A survey of Dartmouth students found that 45 percent of Democrats would be uncomfortable with a roommate of opposite political views, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans. Meanwhile, the passions to block conservative speakers at Middlebury and the University of California, Berkeley, should also give us pause: Liberalism mustn’t be illiberal.",
		"12" : "11. Let’s avoid the temptation to chase the latest shiny thing. Focus on what’s truly important: health, tax and housing policy, the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, the efforts to undermine women’s health programs, and the effort to slash foreign aid just as 20 million people face possible famine.",
		"13" : "12. The Republic stands. Checks and balances have constrained Trump, courts have blocked his travel ban, journalists have provided oversight, and the public has hounded members of Congress. Alarm that the U.S. might slip into a fascist dictatorship has diminished — but it’s a long three years and nine months still ahead of us."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "BOSTON — Every morning, I stand behind the metal detectors, searching bags as students enter the school. They come clutching iced coffee and bags of chips, their faces burned by the wind. Sometimes they raise a hand in greeting, but mostly they look off into the distance, bobbing their heads to the music in their earbuds. I am an administrator at a public high school in Boston, serving almost entirely low-income black and Latino students, and that means every morning I am the white guy at the metal detector telling them they are suspected of a crime as they walk into their school.",
		"2" : "I’ve been an educator in urban schools for over a decade. There are mornings when I imagine a different life, one where I take the train downtown and sit at a desk, actually sit, for 15 minutes over the course of a day. But it is just a passing thought. I keep on going to school because I believe in the work, which is another way of saying I believe in the kids. And then I arrive, and I see their faces framed by metal detectors.",
		"3" : "There are metal detectors at the entrance of nearly every public high school in Boston — I imagine it’s the same in most major cities. Last year, when I started working at this school as part of a new administration, we were determined not to use them. We made it until October, when a student brought a knife to school. He was a gentle kid, a ninth grader, and he said he’d brought the knife only because some guys in his neighborhood were harassing him on the way to school and he needed to protect himself. But our first job is to keep the school safe, and so we asked the district for metal detectors, which arrived before 7 the next morning. I had never seen anything arrive so promptly from the district. Textbook orders take months.",
		"4" : "At first we didn’t know how to use them, but we figured it out through trial and error. Set them up too close to the door and the kids have to wait outside in the rain. You need a table for their bags, but if you put it too close to the detectors, the alarm will keep going off. You need people to check the bags, people to run the wand over students who set off the alarm, people to ask kids to empty their pockets, and then to ask them to try again. People like me.",
		"5" : "As a student in rural New Hampshire, I never had to enter my high school through metal detectors. It was a concrete monolith with a vocational center and auto shop in one wing, where everyone was white, only a handful of kids were on the college track, and nobody was made to feel like a criminal.",
		"6" : "The reality for my students is different. They have been followed through stores, had people roll up their car windows or cross the street when they approach. So perhaps they are unsurprised by the metal detectors.",
		"7" : "I try to tell myself none of this is within my control. I think of our school’s work to design courses around diverse texts, hire teachers who reflect our students’ cultures and connect kids with opportunities like internships — how we welcome all students with the promise that we will not rest until they achieve their potential.",
		"8" : "But I see how their body language shifts when they walk through metal detectors, some wrapping their arms around themselves and others throwing their heads back in defiance. I see how they fixate on their phone screens or scarves, anything to avoid meeting my gaze. In that moment, there is no denying I am part of the machine.",
		"9" : "Still, the only way my kids will make their way through this world is armed with an education, which means they have to enter the building. Which means every morning, I try to disrupt the narrative the only way I know how: by greeting them by name, asking about last night’s game, about their families, their plans for next weekend and for college.",
		"10" : "Sometimes, when I’m searching through bags, I see a book and ask a student how she likes it, what else she reads, and then maybe I recommend an author to check out. Sometimes she says thanks. But I wonder what she is really thinking as I zip the bag back up, hand it back and try to catch her eye as I say good morning, welcome to school. I’m glad you’re here."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The establishment press has been vicious about Donald Trump. He’s portrayed, day after day, as a narcissist, personally obnoxious, with a policy agenda to match. He deserves most of this criticism.",
		"2" : "But does he deserve all of it? Does he never do anything right? Say anything wise? Are all his schemes to reform this agency and abolish that regulation utterly misguided? Can “President Trump’s America” really be compared to Vladimir Putin’s Russia?",
		"3" : "Surely, if there is a “party line” among the establishment media in the United States, it is anti-Trump, not pro. That doesn’t make it wrong. In fact, it’s largely right. But the venom, the obsession, the knife-twisting are hard to understand.",
		"4" : "It must be partly a matter of bad timing. Mr. Trump came along just as the mainstream media, especially newspapers, were trying to come to terms with the internet. Hoary concepts like “objectivity” and “balance” were giving way. This was a good thing, believe it or not. Reporters no longer had to pretend that after spending weeks or months on a story, they had emerged with no opinion about it. The word “I” could now be used to refer to oneself, rather than “a reporter.” Mr. Trump, already dislikable, became the first test case of the new mind-set.",
		"5" : "Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, though, and even Donald Trump can’t be wrong all the time.",
		"6" : "With that in mind, we’re looking for a few positive words about the president, and we’re asking for your help. This is not about Trump the family man. It’s not another forum for debating the issues. It is a place to point out positive things Mr. Trump has said or done from the viewpoint of The New York Times and its readers. (And don’t tell me Times readers are too diverse to classify. You know who you are.)",
		"7" : "So here’s an example. Twitter. Donald Trump tweets. Yes, of course, what he tweets is more important than the mere fact that he tweets. But that mere fact is not trivial. With his use of Twitter as a sort of brain dump, exposing his thinking to the world at all hours of day and night, he has made social media almost a part of our constitutional system.",
		"8" : "And he apparently writes his tweets himself. Here is the direct connection to the people that presidents always say they want and presidential aides always strive to prevent them from getting, for fear that the boss will go “off message.”",
		"9" : "As with so much new technology, Twitter works its magic by cutting out the middleman. But the benefit in this case is not just economic. Thanks to @realDonaldtrump, the average citizen now has a view straight into the president’s id. You may not like what you see, but you can see it.",
		"10" : "President Barack Obama tweeted, or had someone tweet on his behalf. But he never embraced the idea as Mr. Trump has.",
		"11" : "So that’s one good thing he has done for the country. Can you think of another? Please let me know at somethingnice@nytimes.com. We’ll be revisiting this theme regularly in Sunday Review."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "At a rally in New York City in 1962, the famously liberal journalist Murray Kempton said to an audience full of old Reds: “I have known many Communists in my life. I have not known them as criminals. I knew them once as activists — and we had our quarrels. But while this country has not been kind to you, it has been fortunate in having you. You have been arrested, you have been followed, you have had your phones bugged, you have had your children fired. Throughout this, I can think of numbers of you I have known who have remained gallant and pleasant and unbroken.” He added, “I salute you and I hope for times to be better.”",
		"2" : "My mother was in the audience that night and said, when she came home: “America was fortunate to have had the Communists here. They, more than most, prodded the country into becoming the democracy it always said it was.”",
		"3" : "My parents were working-class socialists. I grew up in the late 1940s and early ’50s thinking of them and their friends as what they themselves called “progressives.” The sociology of the progressive world was complex. At its center were full-time organizers for the Communist Party, at the periphery left-wing sympathizers, and at various points in between everything from rank-and-file party card holders to respected fellow travelers.",
		"4" : "In my childhood, these distinctions did not exist for me. The people who came to our Bronx apartment or were present at the fund-raising parties we attended, the rallies we went to, and the May Day parades we marched in were all simply progressives. At the kitchen table they drank tea, ate black bread and herring, and talked “issues.” I understood nothing of what they said, but I was always excited by the richness of their rhetoric, the intensity of their arguments, the urgency and longing behind that hot river of words that came pouring ceaselessly from them.",
		"5" : "They were voyagers on that river, these plumbers, pressers and sewing machine operators; and they took with them on their journey not only their own narrow, impoverished experience but also a set of abstractions with transformative powers. When these people sat down to talk, Politics sat down with them, Ideas sat down with them; above all, History sat down with them. They spoke and thought within a context that lifted them out of the nameless, faceless obscurity into which they had been born, and gave them the conviction that they had rights as well as obligations. They were not simply the disinherited of the earth, they were proletarians with a founding myth of their own (the Russian Revolution) and a civilizing worldview (Marxism).",
		"6" : "While it is true that thousands of people joined the Communist Party in those years because they were members of the hardscrabble working class (garment district Jews, West Virginia miners, California fruit pickers), it was even truer that many more thousands in the educated middle class (teachers, scientists, writers) joined because for them, too, the party was possessed of a moral authority that lent shape and substance, through its passion for structure and the eloquence of its rhetoric, to an urgent sense of social injustice.",
		"7" : "Most Communists never set foot in party headquarters, laid eyes on a Central Committee member, or were privy to policy-making sessions. But every rank-and-filer knew that party unionists were crucial to the rise of industrial labor; party lawyers defended blacks in the South; party organizers lived, worked, and sometimes died with miners in Appalachia; farm workers in California; steel workers in Pittsburgh. What made it all real were the organizations the party built: the International Workers Order, the National Negro Congress, the Unemployment Councils. Whenever some new world catastrophe announced itself throughout the Depression and World War II, The Daily Worker sold out in minutes.",
		"8" : "It is perhaps hard to understand now, but at that time, in this place, the Marxist vision of world solidarity as translated by the Communist Party induced in the most ordinary of men and women a sense of one’s own humanity that ran deep, made life feel large; large and clarified. It was to this clarity of inner being that so many became not only attached, but addicted. No reward of life, no love nor fame nor wealth, could compete with the experience. It was this all-in-allness of world and self that, all too often, made of the Communists true believers who could not face up to the police state corruption at the heart of their faith, even when a 3-year-old could see that it was eating itself alive.",
		"9" : "I was 20 years old in April 1956 when Nikita Khrushchev addressed the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and revealed to the world the incalculable horror of Stalin’s rule. Night after night the people at my father’s kitchen table raged or wept or sat staring into space. I was beside myself with youthful rage. “Lies!” I screamed at them. “Lies and treachery and murder. And all in the name of socialism! In the name of socialism!” Confused and heartbroken, they pleaded with me to wait and see, this couldn’t be the whole truth, it simply couldn’t be. But it was.",
		"10" : "The 20th Congress report brought with it political devastation for the organized left around the world. Within weeks of its publication, 30,000 people in this country quit the party, and within the year it was as it had been in its 1919 beginnings: a small sect on the American political map.",
		"11" : "The effective life of the Communist Party in the United States was approximately 40 years in length. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were Communists at one time or another during those 40 years. Many of these people endured social isolation, financial and professional ruin, and even imprisonment. They were two generations of Americans whose lives were formed by political history as were no other American lives save those of the original Revolutionists. History is in them — and they are in history."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "With President Trump now talking about overhauling the tax code, it’s worth reflecting on the last time Congress revamped the system: the Tax Reform Act of 1986.",
		"2" : "That bill’s success relied on a clear set of principles, a committed president, an effective Treasury secretary, bipartisan support and congressional committee chairmen willing to put their reputations on the line. Few of those pieces seem in place today, and the Trump administration hasn’t even begun to face the trade-offs necessary to cut rates without increasing the deficit or widening the gap between rich and poor. But perhaps the lessons of the past show a way forward.",
		"3" : "After World War II, federal tax rates rose steadily, loopholes proliferated, and the tax code grew more complex. By the 1980s, its unfairness was indisputable. Middle-class taxpayers shouldered the burden for the wealthy, who often paid little tax. Republicans liked lower rates, and Democrats wanted loopholes closed, but no one had put the two together. So how did we make that combination?",
		"4" : "It took years of work. In 1983, Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri and I introduced a tax reform bill that cut rates and closed loopholes, one I outlined in a 1984 book, “The Fair Tax.” I tried to sell the idea to Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential nominee, but he rejected it. President Ronald Reagan, however, worried that Mr. Mondale might embrace reform and seize the initiative on cutting tax rates, so he asked the Treasury Department to study the issue and report back after the election.",
		"5" : "The department’s first study called for rate cuts and closing loopholes. The latter was predictably savaged by special interests. A subsequent, watered-down but still useful report offered a framework based on four principles: equity, so that equal incomes paid equal taxes; efficiency, to let the market allocate resources more freely; simplicity, to reduce loopholes; and fairness, to ensure that those who have more income pay more tax.",
		"6" : "In 1985, President Reagan met in the West Wing with a bipartisan group of senators — not unusual in those days. I jokingly told the president that he and I backed reform for different reasons: As an actor, he’d paid a marginal rate of 90 percent; as a professional basketball player, I’d been a depreciable asset. We all agreed that the system was broken.",
		"7" : "The task of getting the president’s bill passed fell to Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Bob Packwood, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. It was tough sledding in the House, where all revenue bills start. After failing to eliminate a tax break for banks, the bill stalled. But Mr. Rostenkowski persevered, and thanks to his clout and deal making, a bill limped to the Senate. It was far from what Mr. Reagan wanted, but he’d urged House Republicans to support it to “keep the process alive.”",
		"8" : "Senator Packwood held 33 days of hearings before rewriting the bill in committee. Things took a familiar route: Lobbyists swarmed the halls outside the hearing room, which the press called “Gucci Gulch.” Because the committee didn’t follow the Treasury Department’s four principles, there was no rationale to resist the lobbyists. So the business deduction for excise taxes, benefits for the timber industry, the capital gains exclusion and other loopholes went untouched, making it impossible to lower rates without increasing the deficit. An unnamed White House source called reform “moribund,” and Mr. Packwood abandoned the fight.",
		"9" : "Then, over a beer with his chief of staff at the Irish Times pub, Senator Packwood decided to give the bill-writing one more chance. But this time he decided to embrace Treasury’s principles and to do the work in private.",
		"10" : "Mr. Packwood convened three Republican and three Democratic Finance Committee members in his office. He knew we had to act fast before the special interests got organized. We met every morning from 8 to 11 during one week and for 10 hours on Saturday. When we disagreed on what to do about a loophole or rate reduction, we’d vote. Sometimes the winning side had three Democrats and one Republican, sometimes three Republicans and one Democrat. Whatever the outcome, we supported the majority.",
		"11" : "With seven respected committee members backing the bill, Bob Packwood cajoled, threatened and persuaded others on the committee to embrace it, outmaneuvering senators who wanted higher rates and real estate lobbyists eager to protect tax shelters. There were a few perilous moments. We came up short on revenue at one point, increasing the deficit in a supposedly revenue-neutral bill. Initially we missed our agreed income-distribution goals. But in the end, the bill passed committee 20 to 0; and then, after a big battle on I.R.A.s, it passed the Senate 97 to 3. That kind of vote really used to happen.",
		"12" : "As a conference committee then negotiated differences between the House and Senate bills, Representative Rostenkowski hovered large. Like Senator Packwood, he wanted to show he was a chairman who could complete what Washington insiders said was impossible. He called in chits, delivering reluctant Democrats.",
		"13" : "The final bill chopped the top rate to 28 percent from 50 percent, closed nearly $100 billion a year in loopholes, taxed labor and capital at the same rate, and gave low-income Americans one of the biggest tax cuts of their lives. Most people got to save more of every dollar they earned, corporations were treated more equally, and the wealthy ended up paying a higher share of total income tax revenue because they’d benefited disproportionately from the loopholes we’d eliminated.",
		"14" : "Treasury Secretary Jim Baker’s role was critical, particularly on corporate tax changes. High-paying companies benefited from a rate cut to 34 percent, but those who lost loopholes and paid higher taxes — real estate, oil and gas, and some manufacturing industries — would appeal. Secretary Baker had to back up the “no” that they’d heard from Mr. Packwood and Mr. Rostenkowski. He knew that the president’s goal was lower rates and that giving up loopholes was the way to get them. A man of substance and political smarts, he knew, as they said in his home state of Texas, when to hold and when to fold.",
		"15" : "Throughout, the press played a positive role. Its scrutiny was a bulwark against special interests. More important were the tireless staff members who knew the arcane details of tax policy and were savvy enough to understand the explosive political terrain.",
		"16" : "In the end, the Tax Reform Act upheld the general interest over the special interests, showing that clear principles, legislative skill and persistence could change a fundamentally unfair system.",
		"17" : "After it was over, the team gathered at the White House on a bright October afternoon as President Reagan signed the bill. But Senator Packwood and I were stuck by chance in Oregon campaigning — he for re-election and I for the Democratic candidate for governor — and fog made us miss our flight back to Washington. Yet, at Mr. Packwood’s suggestion, we did our own news conference. Bipartisanship then was something to be proud of.",
		"18" : "Over the years, bill after bill has chipped away at the changes we made, and people today once again see unfairness everywhere in the code. Tax liability appears to be totally random. Loopholes cost over $1 trillion, and equal incomes don’t pay equal taxes. The question is the same as in 1986: Can our leaders put principle and country over politics and party, and work together for the common good?",
		"19" : "Given the extreme polarization within and between the parties, the odds are against success. Legislating is a very human experience in which trust and mutual respect play critical roles. But 1986 proved that when both are present, big things can get done."

		"1" : "Here’s some good news for self-conscious people. That coffee stain on your shirt, those mismatched earrings you absent-mindedly selected this morning, that unfortunate haircut you just got — people do not notice those things as much as you think.",
		"2" : "Although it can feel as if your flaws and missteps are the focus of everyone’s attention, research in social psychology suggests otherwise. In a classic study from the 1990s, for example, participants put on a shirt emblazoned with the face of the singer Barry Manilow and then walked into a room full of people. Later, when asked how many people in the room would be able to identify what was on their shirt, the participants significantly overestimated: It turned out that only half the number of people noticed as they had thought.",
		"3" : "Now here’s the bad news. Most of the time, when you’re minding your own business and feeling relatively inconspicuous, you’re being watched much more than you realize. My colleagues and I demonstrated this in several studies whose findings we published in this month’s issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.",
		"4" : "In one experiment, we asked two strangers participating in our study to arrive in our lab at the same time. They were seated in a waiting room and told that the experimenter was running a little behind schedule. They were invited to pass the time by reading one of the newspapers provided (or in any way they liked) as they waited for the study to begin. Five minutes later, the experimenter returned, told the participants she was ready to begin and ushered them into separate rooms in a different part of the lab.",
		"5" : "Unbeknown to the participants, the study had begun the moment they walked into the waiting room. The real reason they were made to wait was to give them an opportunity to watch — and to feel observed or unobserved by — each other.",
		"6" : "Once the participants were in their private rooms, one of them was asked to write down anything he or she noticed or thought about the other person, and then to report on a numerical scale how much he or she had observed the other person. The other participant was asked to write down anything he or she believed the other person had noticed or thought about him or her, and then to estimate how much the other person had observed him or her, using the same scale.",
		"7" : "Although people surreptitiously noticed all kinds of details about each other — clothing, personality, mood — we found that people were convinced that the other person wasn’t watching them much, if at all.",
		"8" : "So other people notice our coffee stains less than we think, but they watch us in general more than we think. The problem, in both cases, is that we project the focus of our attention onto others. Because we’re fixated on our coffee stain (or whatever we happen to be self-conscious about), we assume others must be, too. But when nothing in particular draws our attention to ourselves, we neglect the fact that we may nevertheless be an object of other people’s interest.",
		"9" : "In short, we pay too much attention to what we’re paying attention to.",
		"10" : "Assuming other people are focused on the same thing we are is at the root of many kinds of miscommunication. Employees pull their hair out in frustration while bosses obliviously believe their instructions are simple and straightforward. Spouses feel misunderstood because their partners fail to notice that they cleaned the house. Activists preoccupied with the issue of health care assume others are uncaring because they can’t recall what a single-payer system is.",
		"11" : "We all have a tendency to egocentrically ascribe our own perspective to others. That doesn’t make us selfish or bad. But it’s worth keeping in mind that everyone’s attention illuminates the world in a particular way, and what gets spotlighted differs from person to person."

In January, the building’s new owners began eviction proceedings against me, on the grounds that owning a pet violated my lease. But I’ve noticed that listings for newly renovated units advertise the building as pet-friendly. I suspect the eviction suit is harassment (I’m head of the tenants’ association). Does my landlord have grounds to evict me, and can he have different rules for different tenants?",
		"2" : "A. Under New York City rules, if a tenant has openly owned a pet for three months and the landlord or management knew about it or should have known about it, the landlord waives the right to evict the pooch or the tenant. Assuming your Chihuahua has lived openly with you for all this time, that rule should apply.",
		"3" : "But you have an even stronger case: Under state law, there is a six-year statute of limitations for bringing a claim for a breach of contract, and a lease is considered a contract. “You don’t even need to show that your landlord knew or should have known” about the pet, said Darryl M. Vernon, a real estate lawyer who represents people with companion animals. You might even be able to adopt another pet, because “the clause is now unenforceable forever,” Mr. Vernon said. (The city’s rule, however, applies only to your current dog.)",
		"4" : "Even so, you are not out of the woods. An eviction proceeding is serious. You should get a lawyer to represent you, if you can afford one. Avoid corresponding with your landlord without seeking legal advice. “Sometimes people write back things that can hurt their rights,” Mr. Vernon said. In the meantime, collect evidence that shows how long you have owned your Chihuahua, like veterinarian bills or proof of adoption.",
		"5" : "As for your new neighbors, your landlord can give pet-friendly leases to some tenants and not others. The landlord might tolerate pets in market-rate apartments because those apartments tend to be much more expensive, and so the more perks he can offer, the more likely it is he’ll be able to draw high-paying tenants."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "You never really know when a FaceTime chat will change your life. For Eric Thames, the majors’ early-season slugging sensation, it happened in late 2013, when he was playing for a team in Caracas, Venezuela.",
		"2" : "Three organizations — Seattle, Baltimore and Houston — had taken turns that season with Thames, who was playing in the Venezuelan Winter League to recover from a broken hand. His agent, Adam Karon, reached out with an opportunity that Thames immediately rejected: the NC Dinos of the Korea Baseball Organization.",
		"3" : "“Back then, the stigma was if you go to Asia, you go when you’re like 35 — you’re older, you’re out of it,” said Thames, who had just turned 27 when the offer came. “I said, ‘No chance — I’m staying here and getting back to the big leagues.’ My agent convinced me to go for a year. It’s good money, so I did it.",
		"4" : "“Then I signed a two-year deal after that,” he said, “and I just figured I’ll be in Asia and make good money. It’s a good team, a good country. Then — bam! — I’m back here. Being here is like the most random thing to me. I was not expecting it at all.”",
		"5" : "Thames was speaking early in spring training at the Milwaukee Brewers’ camp in Phoenix. After his three spellbinding seasons in South Korea, the Brewers had met all of Thames’s requirements for returning: a three-year contract with an everyday player’s salary and a clause that forbids the team to option him to the minors.",
		"6" : "For three years and $16 million (plus a team option for 2020), the Brewers, it seems, got the steal of the off-season. Thames has a .350 average and 11 home runs, tying him with Ryan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals for the major league lead and challenging the record for April home runs — 14, shared by Albert Pujols (in 2006) and Alex Rodriguez (2007).",
		"7" : "If Thames keeps this up much longer, the Milwaukee-inspired nickname bestowed on him this month by MLB Network Radio — the Sultan of Brat — just might stick. Yet his celebrity may still not approach what it was in Changwon, the home of the Dinos, for whom Thames hit .349 with 124 homers in three seasons.",
		"8" : "“Over there, he was almost like a comic-book superhero — big beard, big muscles,” said Zach Stewart, a pitcher for the Class AAA Norfolk Tides who played with Thames in South Korea.",
		"9" : "“He’s nothing like they’d ever seen in that country; people just don’t look like that,” Stewart said. “And to have the kind of production he had, to be the M.V.P., that took it to a whole other level. He could hardly go anywhere without being hounded. We’d go out to eat after the game and people would just swarm the table. It was ridiculous.”",
		"10" : "To Stewart, it was not much of a surprise. He was also teammates with Thames in 2010, with Class AA New Hampshire in the Toronto Blue Jays’ farm system. Thames was 23 that season, and he batted .288 with 27 home runs and 104 runs batted in, leading the Eastern League.",
		"11" : "“It was unbelievable what kind of season he had,” Stewart said. “He was the heart of our team.”",
		"12" : "Yet Thames did not make much of an impression as a rookie for the Blue Jays in 2011. He batted .262 with 12 homers in 95 games, constantly dreading the prospect of a trip to the bench or the minors. The Blue Jays traded Thames the next summer to Seattle, where he hit .220. He did not appear in the majors in 2013.",
		"13" : "To Karon, the agent, the 2014 contract in South Korea represented more than a chance for Thames to make about $800,000. Karon had never encouraged a client so young to play there, but he made an exception for Thames.",
		"14" : "“My view was, ‘Look, you’ve always been successful when you’ve played every day, and you’re not going to get the opportunity here,’” Karon said. “He was the last man on the 40-man roster of the worst team in baseball.”",
		"15" : "That team was the Astros, who granted Thames his release after Karon finally persuaded him to try the K.B.O. Stewart compared games there to the last few innings of spring training exhibitions, with a few highly skilled players scattered among those with far less polish. Thames clearly stood out, overpowering pitchers who feared him so much that they ultimately sharpened his hitting eye.",
		"16" : "“They tried to just throw junk at him all day,” Stewart said. “As a hitter, that would drive me crazy — ‘Oh, my God, just throw me a fastball!’ — and you can see how guys would want to just go up there and hack. But I think that made him more patient.”",
		"17" : "The numbers support that theory. In his rookie season with Toronto, Thames swung at 34.7 percent of pitches outside the strike zone, according to PitchFX data. In his first 21 games this season, the figure had plunged by more than half, to 16.8 percent.",
		"18" : "Thames also improved his technique while overseas, studying interviews with Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez about their approaches to hitting. Thames revised his swing by focusing on a flat bat path that would give his hits more backspin. His old, uphill swing was good for batting practice, but inconsistent thereafter.",
		"19" : "“You don’t want, like, cage bombs,” Thames said. “That doesn’t translate into a game. But if you have a good, clean swing, with a good bat path and ball flight, that’s what you want.”",
		"20" : "The Brewers noticed from afar, scouting Thames extensively on video as he launched 47 home runs in 2015 and 40 more last year. His prodigious start to this season, predictably, has led to whispers about performance-enhancing drugs. Thames laughed off the issue on Tuesday, after hitting his 11th homer and taking his third drug test since the start of spring training.",
		"21" : "“If people keep thinking I’m on stuff, I’ll be here every day,” he told reporters. “I have a lot of blood and urine.”",
		"22" : "Karon said he talked with Thames for a long time that night, concluding that there was nothing Thames could do to change perceptions.",
		"23" : "“It saddens me that we’ve gotten to this point in baseball, where if someone has success, the immediate reaction is, ‘He’s got to be cheating,’” Karon said. “But it’s interesting: The old Eric would have been infuriated by it, and it would have affected him. Now there’s an inner peace he’s developed.”",
		"24" : "Thames’s attitude — playful instead of defiant — is refreshing. He knew he was good, but his start has surprised even himself, a slugger who took the long route to become a sudden star.",
		"25" : "It has been five weeks or so since the United States won the World Baseball Classic — a nice moment with a sense that the event was growing in popularity. Now it is time to consider the possible wreckage.",
		"26" : "The Seattle Mariners’ rotation offers an intriguing perspective on the risks to a pitcher of exerting the arm so early. The Mariners had hoped to contend with a rotation led by Felix Hernandez, Drew Smyly and James Paxton. Instead, they are off to an uneven start, and they placed Hernandez on the disabled list last week with shoulder inflammation. He joined Smyly, who landed there in March with a significant elbow injury.",
		"27" : "Hernandez started twice for Venezuela in the tournament, working seven and two-thirds innings, and Smyly looked dominant in his start for the United States, striking out eight in four and two-thirds innings. Smyly — who could miss eight weeks — regularly threw harder than 93 miles per hour at the W.B.C. after averaging only about 90 m.p.h. last season.",
		"28" : "Paxton did not join Team Canada, which was short on pitching and was forced to start the long-retired Ryan Dempster in two of its three games.",
		"29" : "“The advice I was getting was that it wasn’t a good time for me to take on those extra innings that early,” Paxton told reporters in January. “I got married this off-season, so my training program got pushed back just a little bit, and I didn’t want to sacrifice getting ready for the Mariners’ season by shortening that to get ready for the World Baseball Classic. Also, I wanted to take a jump in innings this year, a significant one, and I want to save those innings for the Mariners’ season.”",
		"30" : "So far, it looks like a wise choice. Canada was winless in March, but Paxton has thrived in April. In his fifth major league season — none of the first four yielded more than 121 innings — Paxton has a 3-0 record and a 1.39 earned run average. Hernandez and Smyly can only watch from the disabled list.",
		"31" : "Commissioner Rob Manfred will soon begin meeting with players as they come to New York to play the Yankees or the Mets, hoping to glean their opinions on what he can do to accelerate the pace of play. This has been a prominent item on Manfred’s agenda, and he must have been heartened by Thursday’s game in Boston.",
		"32" : "At 2 hours 21 minutes, the Yankees’ 3-0 victory over the Red Sox was the shortest game between those two teams since 1994. A glance at the box score shows the main reason: Neither team drew a walk, and the game required only 217 pitches.",
		"33" : "The main issue with pace of play is obvious — the more pitches thrown, the longer a game takes. And the main obstacle facing Manfred is the financial incentive for hitters to work deep counts. In doing so, hitters tend to deaden the action, risking strikeouts in order to find just the right pitch to launch over the fence.",
		"34" : "Curtis Granderson, the veteran Mets outfielder, last week explained the basic calculus that can make games drag: A lot of walks and a lot of power lead to a strong on-base plus slugging percentage, which teams crave.",
		"35" : "“Now the talk is, ‘If my on-base percentage is this and my O.P.S. is this, that’s how I get rewarded financially in this game — then I’m going to do that,’” said Granderson, who has not spoken with Manfred about the pace of games. “Well, that means I need to see a lot of pitches, and when I do swing, I need to do damage with these pitches out there. You’re telling me that’s what you want. That’s the philosophy across the board.”",
		"36" : "The commissioner has a noble goal — a crisper pace for the long-term good of the game. But front offices want something else, and major league hitters are skilled and shrewd enough to provide it.",
		"37" : "Nearly 19,000 people have played at least one game in the majors. Before last week, none of them had come from Lithuania or South Africa. The Pittsburgh Pirates changed that in one series against the Chicago Cubs.",
		"38" : "Dovydas Neverauskas, a right-hander from Lithuania, made his debut by pitching two innings Monday. When the Pirates returned him to the minors Wednesday, they replaced him with Gift Ngoepe, an infielder who made his debut that night, went 1 for 2 and turned a game-ending double play at second base.",
		"39" : "“Everything is breathtaking right now,” Ngoepe (pronounced n-GO-pay) told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “This just shows it doesn’t matter where you come from. No matter where you are, who you are, you can still make it.”",
		"40" : "For Ngoepe and Neverauskas, the promotions capped painstaking journeys to the majors. Ngoepe — the first major leaguer born on the continent of Africa — signed with Pittsburgh in September 2008, and Neverauskas signed 10 months later. Neverauskas spent nearly three full seasons in the Gulf Coast League, living in a dormitory at the team’s training complex in Bradenton, Fla.",
		"41" : "“Everything was hard the first three years,” he said in a telephone interview. “I was 17, 18, 19 years old, far away from home, no friends, no family. Playing in the G.C.L., it’s not the life you expected. It was a grind, and it was hard to get used to it.”",
		"42" : "Neverauskas learned baseball from his father, Virmidas, who played as a boy, while the sport was being introduced to the country. Virmidas founded a national youth team in Lithuania when Dovydas was young, and took him on trips all over the world. On a visit to the United States in April 2006, Dovydas saw the Oakland Athletics host the Yankees.",
		"43" : "“At the time, I probably just knew Derek Jeter,” he said. “I saw him from far away.”",
		"44" : "On Monday, Neverauskas was at the center of the action, finally ascending to Pittsburgh after having moved to the bullpen in 2015. Now that he pitches for shorter stints, his fastball plays up — it averaged 97 miles an hour in his debut — and he mixes in curveballs and cutters.",
		"45" : "Like Neverauskas, Ngoepe, now 27, attended Major League Baseball’s European Academy and had a family connection to the game. His mother, Maureen, worked for a recreation-league team in Randburg, South Africa, and raised him and his brother Victor around the ballpark. Ngoepe attracted the attention of scouts, began competing internationally and has for years been considered the best defensive infielder in the Pirates’ system.",
		"46" : "South Africa competed in the World Baseball Classic in 2006 and 2009; Ngoepe played on the 2009 team and had two triples in one game. Lithuania is further behind in its baseball development.",
		"47" : "“I hope it’s going to grow the game, to see a Lithuanian guy who made it all the way from there to here,” Neverauskas said. “The main thing is the fields. We don’t have baseball fields, and to get youth tournaments and engage with other countries, that’s the only issue.”",
		"48" : "Developing an unfamiliar sport can take decades for a country, but the Pirates, in particular, have been eager to explore. Their signing of two pitchers from India, Dinesh Patel and Rinku Singh, inspired “Million Dollar Arm,” a 2014 film starring Jon Hamm. Neither pitcher advanced beyond Class A, and both are retired.",
		"49" : "However the careers of Neverauskas and Ngoepe unfold, they have already made an indelible mark: After their debuts, both players donated their caps to the Hall of Fame."

		"1" : "It was a day at Yankee Stadium when anything seemed possible.",
		"2" : "On Saturday, less than 48 hours after returning from a two-game sweep of the Red Sox in Boston, the Yankees took their second consecutive win over the Baltimore Orioles, the team they had been chasing in the American League East.",
		"3" : "They also scored in double digits for the second straight game — 14 runs on Friday, 12 on Saturday — and followed their five-home-run performance on Friday with four more. Brett Gardner, who had not homered in what he said felt like “two or three years” (actually nine months), went deep twice.",
		"4" : "And at the close of business, the Yankees — whose 2016 season essentially died in April, when they won just eight of 22 games — found themselves not only atop their division by a game but also, at 15-7, with the best record in Major League Baseball.",
		"5" : "So, naturally, the question came up: Since Aaron Judge, the 6-foot-7 rookie outfielder who can hit a baseball from the Bronx to Westchester County, already has 10 home runs, how many might he hit for the full season?",
		"6" : "“You kind of wonder what he’s going to do,” Manager Joe Girardi said Saturday after the Yankees’ 12-4 victory, in which Judge delivered a two-run bomb to go along with the two home runs he hit the night before. “I’m not sure you really expect 10 home runs from anybody in a month. I mean, that would be 60 in a year.”",
		"7" : "Sixty, of course, remains a magic number in the realm of home runs. Girardi stopped short of saying it could not be done, as did Gardner when he was answering the same question.",
		"8" : "“I hate to put a number on him,” Gardner said. “But we all know how physically gifted he is and how big and strong he is. So nothing would surprise me, really.”",
		"9" : "Even Judge, who is so modest he refuses to acknowledge the majesty of his home runs, could not bring himself to shrug off the question.",
		"10" : "“Anything’s possible,” he said with a sheepish smile.",
		"11" : "That was how things felt on a day when a player like Gardner, who had not hit a baseball out of any park since last July 30, belted home runs in each of his first two at-bats and when a player like Austin Romine, who was considered a stopgap when catcher Gary Sanchez went down three weeks ago with a biceps strain, showed himself once again to be almost impossible to remove from the lineup.",
		"12" : "And that is how things feel when a player like Judge becomes a player like Judge. After striking out in precisely half of his first 84 major-league at-bats, Judge became one of the game’s most feared hitters over his next 73.",
		"13" : "“We’ve got a really deep lineup,” Gardner said. “There’s no easy at-bats here.”",
		"14" : "April is showering baseballs in the Bronx, and an inordinate number of them are landing over the outfield fences after leaving the bats of the home team, which has not truly deserved the nickname Bronx Bombers for a couple of years.",
		"15" : "But this is a different Yankees team from the one that has taken the field over the past five seasons, and a much better team than anyone could have expected, even after a surprising 24-9 record in spring training games.",
		"16" : "“You think about where we were a year ago in April, we were really struggling,” Girardi said. “And you think about where we were the first five games, we were really struggling. So it’s good to see we’re playing a lot better, and we need to continue to do it.”",
		"17" : "After the drama of Friday night, when the Yankees fought back from deficits of 9-1 and 11-4 to tie the score in the bottom of the ninth on a home run by Starlin Castro and then win in the 10th on a home run by Matt Holliday, Saturday’s game was almost an anticlimax.",
		"18" : "Gardner’s two home runs and a sacrifice fly by Romine — who ended the day with five R.B.I., the most by a Yankees No. 9 hitter since a catcher named Joe Girardi drove in seven runs against the Texas Rangers in 1999 — gave the Yankees a 5-0 lead after two innings. The lead grew to 7-0 on a two-run double by Romine in the fourth, and pitcher Michael Pineda kept the Orioles in check despite struggling with his command.",
		"19" : "Romine hit a home run in the sixth, and Judge closed the scoring with his two-run shot in the seventh, leaving little question about the game’s eventual outcome, other than what the final margin would be. Two unearned runs off Pineda in the sixth and two more runs off reliever Tommy Layne in the ninth lengthened the game somewhat but never put the Yankees in jeopardy.",
		"20" : "The real question was this: Can Judge possibly be as good as he seems right now?",
		"21" : "“I’m not amazed by him at all,” Gardner said. “I see the way he goes about his business and how hard he works. He’s a special player who’s capable of just about anything.”",
		"22" : "Asked if what he had shown so far was the real Aaron Judge, or merely a glimpse at a young player who is extraordinarily locked in, Judge said: “It’s just baseball. Sometimes you go up to the plate, and the ball looks like a golf ball up there. And you’ll have times when it looks gigantic and like it’s right down the middle.”",
		"23" : "He left little doubt that for him these days, the baseball looks like a beach ball floating in from the pitcher’s mound.",
		"24" : "At times like that, anything really does seem possible. Even talking about magic numbers in the first month of a baseball season."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — In his role as general manager of the Mets, Sandy Alderson has to worry about the big picture. So before Saturday’s game here, he laid out how the Mets must evaluate everything, from their players’ training regimens to how much water they are drinking, as the roster deals with a rash of early-season injuries, particularly to their best everyday player, outfielder Yoenis Cespedes.",
		"2" : "The Mets are undoubtedly a better team when they are whole, but they will not be for a while longer. Against the Washington Nationals, their hot-hitting rival, the Mets have shown encouraging glimpses of what they could be: a contender for the National League East title.",
		"3" : "Despite their many injuries — the Mets have seven players, including several of their most crucial components, on the disabled list — they have beaten the Nationals in consecutive games. On Friday, they bested Max Scherzer, last year’s National League Cy Young Award winner. On Saturday, they toppled Stephen Strasburg because of Michael Conforto, Jose Reyes and a promising bullpen performance.",
		"4" : "“Things were going bad for a bit,” Conforto said after the 5-3 victory. “But there’s no panic in here, and we’ve got a lot of veteran guys to keep us level. We always had faith that we were going to play well, and I think this weekend it started happening.”",
		"5" : "Conforto, who has gone from barely making the team out of spring training to being an indispensable part of it, hit two home runs for the first multihomer game of his career, driving in three runs. Reyes showed more signs of snapping out of his vicious early slump with two hits, including a solo homer in the ninth.",
		"6" : "Starter Zack Wheeler battled command issues and uneven infield defense over four and two-thirds innings before giving way to five relievers who combined to give up two hits and strike out six the rest of the way. Closer Jeurys Familia, who was pulled during a save situation the previous night because of ineffectiveness, fired a clean inning for a save.",
		"7" : "“Right now, we’re starting to put it together,” Reyes said. “And hopefully we can continue to play the way that we played the first two games here.”",
		"8" : "The two wins over the Nationals, who swept the Mets last weekend, provided a boost to a 10-13 team whose long injury list includes several of its most important players: Cespedes; infielders David Wright, Wilmer Flores and Lucas Duda; and pitchers Steven Matz and Seth Lugo.",
		"9" : "“It would be easy to dismiss this as ‘this is just how baseball goes,’” Alderson said. “But you do have to sort through the injuries and think about the kinds of things you’re doing preventively to make sure they’re minimized.”",
		"10" : "Injuries are unavoidable in baseball, and some of the ones sustained by the Mets are typical of the sport. Matz, Lugo and Duda are out with elbow injuries. But after Cespedes, who has had leg injuries throughout his career, hurt the same leg twice in two weeks, Alderson had questions.",
		"11" : "Cespedes left a game with tightness in his left hamstring on April 20. The Mets declined to place him on the 10-day disabled list, which was reduced from 15 days this season so that teams could take care of relatively routine injuries without losing a vital player for more than two weeks.",
		"12" : "Cespedes missed three games and gained two more days of rest with a day off and a rainout. In his second game back, however, he had to be helped off the field because the hamstring began to hurt again after he hit a double.",
		"13" : "The diagnosis was a muscle strain, and this time, the Mets placed Cespedes on the disabled list.",
		"14" : "The situation is uncomfortably familiar. Last season, Cespedes missed a few days to rest a right quadriceps muscle and returned briefly — only to end up on the disabled list.",
		"15" : "Although the pattern repeated itself this season, Alderson said he was not second-guessing how the team had responded to the hamstring problem. Instead, Alderson said, he wants the team to take a fresh look at how it monitors the players’ daily routines.",
		"16" : "In Cespedes’s case, the Mets will keep an eye on a variety of factors, including his hydration, his weight-training routine and his stretching regimen.",
		"17" : "“There are a number of different things that might have contributed,“ Alderson said. “But we have to figure out something. He might just be susceptible to that kind of injury, and we have to be cognizant of that and make sure we do everything we can to minimize something he may be predisposed to anyway.”",
		"18" : "Cespedes underwent an ultrasound that showed no significant damage, Alderson said, and the Mets hope that he can return in about 10 days.",
		"19" : "More help should be arriving sooner, however. Noah Syndergaard, who was scratched from a scheduled start at the last minute on Thursday because of mild soreness in his right biceps and shoulder, is set to start on Sunday.",
		"20" : "Syndergaard, who refused to have a magnetic resonance imaging examination, said that he was in tune with his body and that he knew the soreness was only a minor problem. He insisted he could have started on Thursday.",
		"21" : "It is uncommon for a player to decline an M.R.I., Alderson said, “but I can’t tie him down and throw him in the tube, either.”",
		"22" : "The Mets did not force Syndergaard to have the exam, believing he was ready to pitch Sunday. He now has a chance to complete a sweep of the Nationals — and put a small degree of concern about the Mets’ injuries to rest.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario — When Kyle Wiltjer interviewed with the Houston Rockets before last year’s N.B.A. draft, he came prepared. He knew all about Daryl Morey, the team’s general manager. He knew all about the Rockets’ belief in analytics. He knew all about their fondness for the 3-point line. Wiltjer, a 6-foot-10 forward with a willowy jump shot, was as personable as he was knowledgeable, or at least that was the way he came across.",
		"2" : "“He was probably one of the greatest draft interviews of all time,” Morey said in a recent telephone interview, “which, honestly, sometimes makes me like guys less.”",
		"3" : "In Morey’s worldview, carefully circumscribed by data, charm does little but cloud judgment. For one thing, he could not tell if Wiltjer was being authentic. Was it all an act? Morey also worries that coaching staffs are susceptible to playing favorites with players like Wiltjer and giving them more minutes than they actually deserve.",
		"4" : "“He was like the student who sits in the front row, giving an apple to the teacher and sucking up to everybody,” Morey said. “I couldn’t get him to break form.”",
		"5" : "It was an odd strike against Wiltjer, who had no idea at the time, or even for months afterward, how close he had come to blowing it during his interview.",
		"6" : "“I didn’t know I was that good,” he said.",
		"7" : "But if Morey had misgivings, he also saw potential and signed Wiltjer as an undrafted free agent. Wiltjer emerged as another experiment for a team that continues to push basketball boundaries.",
		"8" : "While the Rockets were setting N.B.A. records this season for the most 3-pointers attempted and made, Wiltjer, 24, was launching shots from distant galaxies for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, Houston’s affiliate in the N.B.A. Development League. In 31 games with the Vipers, including the playoffs, Wiltjer took 313 3-pointers, which worked out to a league-leading 10.1 attempts a game.",
		"9" : "“In this system, you’re supposed to do what you do well,” Wiltjer said before the Vipers’ season ended last week with a loss here to Raptors 905 in the D-League finals. “So if I’m open, I’m going to shoot it.”",
		"10" : "His position, known in basketball parlance as the stretch 4, is vital to the Rockets. Ryan Anderson, who currently occupies that role for Houston Coach Mike D’Antoni, is one of the best in the business: a forward whose 3-point shooting spaces the floor. Anderson’s mere presence means that defenders have a tougher time cluttering the lane to prevent Houston’s dynamic point guard, James Harden, from driving.",
		"11" : "The Rockets have used the formula to great effect. They went 55-27 in the regular season, and they will face the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals starting Monday.",
		"12" : "As for Wiltjer, the Rockets would love for him to develop into what Morey described as a Ryan Anderson type. They cannot employ enough 3-point artists.",
		"13" : "“I do think he’s on track to help us more next year,” Morey said.",
		"14" : "An all-American at Gonzaga, Wiltjer had offers to sign elsewhere last summer but thought the Houston system was a good fit for his unique skill set. (Remember, he had done ample research on the team.)",
		"15" : "“There aren’t a lot of stretch 4s out there,” Wiltjer said, “so when I heard that D’Antoni was going to be the coach and that Ryan was coming in, it was almost too good to be true on my end.”",
		"16" : "For the Rockets, Wiltjer was a bargain-bin pickup. He was also insurance. Anderson, who averaged 13.6 points a game while shooting 40.4 percent from 3-point range during the regular season, has a four-year deal with the Rockets worth $80 million that runs through 2020.",
		"17" : "“We thought if Ryan were injured, Kyle would be a guy who could step in,” Morey said.",
		"18" : "Wiltjer spent the regular season shuttling between Houston, where he made cameos in 14 games for the Rockets, and the organization’s D-League lab in Hidalgo, Tex., where the Vipers play their home games. The Vipers mimicked the Rockets in almost every conceivable way. Same sets. Same terminology. Same roles. As Anderson’s D-League facsimile, Wiltjer averaged 20.7 points and 6.9 rebounds a game while shooting 38.7 percent from 3-point range.",
		"19" : "“I’ve tried to extend my range because of him,” Wiltjer said of Anderson. “I’ve noticed that there’s the N.B.A. line, and he’s shooting 2 feet behind the line.”",
		"20" : "At the same time, Wiltjer has learned to cope with the inevitable ups and downs of professional life. First, there was the disappointment of going undrafted. “You want to hear your name called,” he said.",
		"21" : "Then he had to overcome the psychological hurdle of being sent to the D-League for the first time. Nobody, he said, really wants to be in the D-League. But he learned to embrace it, he said, as the best opportunity for him to expand his game. There are other players — more than a few — who view it as basketball purgatory.",
		"22" : "“It’s interesting,” Wiltjer said, “because you come down here — and I won’t name names — but you see some guys you grew up watching, and you’re like, ‘Oh, this guy’s a beast!’ And then you go out and play against them, and it’s almost disappointing. You realize why they’re down here.”",
		"23" : "Morey believes in the D-League. He thinks of it as an incubator for players, for staff members and even for ideas. During the 2013-14 season, for example, the Vipers obliterated all kinds of records for 3-point shooting while deliberately avoiding midrange shots — a brash experiment that has had a lasting influence on the organization, and on the rest of the N.B.A.",
		"24" : "“That obviously gave us the confidence, along with Coach D’Antoni’s belief in it, that if we ramped up our style of shooting from distance a little more than most teams, then it could work,” Morey said.",
		"25" : "In terms of player development, Morey does not subscribe to the long-held theory that young players are capable of absorbing wisdom by sitting on the bench. He believes that players need to play, and he cited Clint Capela, now the Rockets’ starting center, as one of the Vipers’ more notable success stories.",
		"26" : "“Most guys are pretty mad about it when they get assigned to the D-League,” Morey said. “But usually after five or 10 games of being down there, they enjoy it. They realize: Hey, I’m here. I get to play. I get to have a big role versus just watching from the bench. But Kyle was enthusiastic about it from the beginning. Kyle may be the most enthusiastic D-League player we’ve ever had.”",
		"27" : "Matt Brase, the Vipers’ coach, said that Wiltjer had worked to improve his rebounding and his defense, two areas of relative weakness. In particular, the Rockets want him to be able to defend different types of forwards: big forwards, slow forwards, quick forwards, small forwards. Brase said that Wiltjer had been fully invested in the process.",
		"28" : "“He’s the type of guy who will call me at night or hit me up the next morning: ‘Hey, did you see the wrinkle the Rockets added on this play?’” Brase said. “He’s trying to learn as much as possible.”",
		"29" : "Wiltjer has rejoined the Rockets ahead of their series against the Spurs. His contract includes a team option for next season. In the language of an organization that lives by hard numbers, Wiltjer said he would like to stick around.",
		"30" : "“Oh, 100 percent,” he said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "There have been several incarnations of Joe Johnson over the years. He was a top-10 pick who did not quite fit in Boston, which led to a trade to Phoenix, where he found his calling as Steve Nash’s favorite gunner. Johnson was an obscenely expensive, yet underappreciated, All-Star in Atlanta. He was also a solid, but somewhat disappointing, cog on a superteam in Brooklyn that ended up being far from super.",
		"2" : "Through it all, Johnson ignored the chatter and remained a player who says little in the locker room but wants the ball when the game is on the line.",
		"3" : "In Johnson’s latest chapter, he is trying something new: He comes off the bench for the Utah Jazz, who unexpectedly are relying on him offensively during their playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers — the only first-round series this year to last seven games. Johnson’s new role was clear Friday night in a tough 98-93 loss in Game 6, in which Johnson, rather than any of the team’s starters, was given the ball in the final seconds with a chance to tie. His 3-point attempt was a brick and allowed the Clippers to hang on for the win.",
		"4" : "That it came down to Johnson was remarkable, since during the season the Jazz were a tough, entertaining team thanks chiefly to Rudy Gobert, Gordon Hayward and George Hill. Johnson, a 16-year veteran and seven-time All-Star, was mostly an afterthought, averaging 23.6 minutes a game.",
		"5" : "But in their first six playoff games, the Jazz have found themselves in need of someone who can score, and Iso Joe — a nickname Johnson earned for his love of isolation plays — has been ready, willing and, most important, usually able. Should it come down to the last shot in Game 7 on Sunday, it would not be surprising if it were Johnson taking it.",
		"6" : "Johnson missed his shot on Friday, but among his highlights this series were a winning shot in Game 1 and a stretch during Game 4 in which he reeled off 11 straight points in the late going, leading Utah to a 105-98 victory.",
		"7" : "When asked after Game 4 to sum up Johnson’s impact, Coach Quin Snyder heaped praise on the veteran guard.",
		"8" : "“He basically either scored or assisted on every basket,” Snyder said. “We knew this is who he is, and he knows it’s playoff time.”",
		"9" : "Johnson’s vital role on a young team has been one of the better stories of the postseason, and as his unusual career begins to wind down, some writers have started to consider his credentials for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.",
		"10" : "Some writers have taken a tongue-in-cheek approach to the idea. Nathaniel Friedman, a frequent GQ contributor, posted on Twitter, “Why not put Joe Johnson in the Hall of Fame, no one would ever notice anyway,” in a reference to Johnson’s unassuming demeanor.",
		"11" : "Devin Kharpertian, who covered Johnson’s Nets days for the website The Brooklyn Game, joked before the season about the possibility of Johnson’s eventual Hall of Fame induction, summing up his acceptance speech this way: “Oh man. Yeah. Thanks.”",
		"12" : "But ESPN’s Kevin Pelton made a more serious case for Johnson, noting that he had surpassed 20,000 career points this season. Among players eligible for Hall of Fame induction, only Tom Chambers has reached that point without getting in.",
		"13" : "Chambers will probably have some company in the coming years, as Antawn Jamison, despite 20,042 career points, is unlikely to be inducted, and Johnson, whose career is most similar statistically to those of Michael Finley, Dennis Johnson and Byron Scott, according to Basketball-Reference.com, will have to overcome a lot to enter the Hall.",
		"14" : "But at his best, Johnson has been one of the few players who could simply take over a game in the final seconds. As he tries to will the Jazz to the second round through an abundance of confidence with the game on the line, he is proving that some things don’t change, even if the way a player is viewed over the years does."

		"1" : "PHILADELPHIA — Cam Quayle went on to be a dentist. Bill Kenney was elected a state senator in Missouri. Ryan Hoag appeared on the television reality show “The Bachelorette.” Marty Moore played in a Super Bowl.",
		"2" : "Don’t recognize the names? That’s O.K. Or better said, that’s irrelevant, because the point is not who they are but what they were — Mr. Irrelevants.",
		"3" : "The nickname goes to the last player chosen in the N.F.L. draft (or in a few cases, to the second-to-last), long after the hoopla and endless chatter over the No. 1 pick. By then, most television viewers of the annual spectacle have changed channels.",
		"4" : "But thanks to Paul Salata, a 90-year-old former professional football player with a charitable streak and mischievous sense of humor, since 1976 the last picks in the draft have been crowned Mr. Irrelevant and feted and good-naturedly ribbed for a week in Southern California by people with an appreciation for the underdog.",
		"5" : "As the N.F.L. has ratcheted up the draft as a big television show, in part to keep the viewership fires burning in the off-season, even Mr. Irrelevant does not seem as irrelevant as he was in years past. With expanded rosters and practice squads, many Mr. Irrelevants are able to carve out a modest living. Some teams have angled to have the last pick and the media attention that comes with it.",
		"6" : "But there is one constant through the years: The last pick rarely makes a dent in his team’s record, with most Mr. Irrelevants spending the bulk of their careers in obscurity on the bench or ending up in the C.F.L. Some have had serviceable or noteworthy careers, but most remain, well, irrelevant to the team’s performance.",
		"7" : "On Saturday, the Denver Broncos, with the last pick, No. 253, generated the Mr. Irrelevant of 2017: quarterback Chad Kelly of Mississippi — the nephew of Jim Kelly, the Buffalo Bills’ Hall of Fame quarterback.",
		"8" : "Unlike the No. 1 pick, which is widely anticipated and seen by millions of fans, the name of Mr. Irrelevant is typically heard by only a handful of fans, diehard followers who tend to rush the stage in mock jubilation just before the last pick is announced. This year, Salata’s daughter, Melanie Fitch, did the honor, and her husband, Ed, unfurled a jersey with the number 253 on the back.",
		"9" : "Salata takes special satisfaction in the annual offbeat ritual.",
		"10" : "Like most of the players awarded Mr. Irrelevant, Salata had a career, in the early 1950s, that was brief and largely unremarkable. A wide receiver at U.S.C., he played just 23 games in the old All-American Football Conference and the N.F.L., and then a few years in Canada, before leaving the game in 1953.",
		"11" : "After football, he landed a few minor roles in movies like “Stalag 17,” and then went to work in his family’s construction business in Southern California.",
		"12" : "For years afterward, he helped one of his old teams, the San Francisco 49ers, on draft day, and saw how players picked in the lower rounds received little notice. Given his own humble career, he thought they deserved a spotlight as well.",
		"13" : "“Everyone who is drafted works hard, and some of them don’t get any recognition,” Salata said in a phone interview from his home in Newport Beach, Calif. “They do their work and should be noticed.”",
		"14" : "About 50 years ago, Salata read about people in a charitable mood who would pick individuals out of a phone book and offer to fly them to Southern California. He wanted to apply what he saw as an act of kindness to football players. So he approached Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who liked his idea of naming the last draft pick Mr. Irrelevant and flying the player to Newport Beach for a celebration.",
		"15" : "The first Irrelevant Week got off to an appropriately madcap start.",
		"16" : "The last player chosen in 1976, Kelvin Kirk, by the Steelers, initially thought he was being mocked. So Salata called the team’s owner, Art Rooney, whom he knew from his brief stay in Pittsburgh, and asked him to tell Kirk that he was in fact being honored. Kirk agreed to participate, but missed his flight to California and the parade in his honor.",
		"17" : "That didn’t stop the parade from going forward.",
		"18" : "Salata went into a grocery store and persuaded a butcher, who looked like a football player, to stand in for Kirk. People cheered and waved, apparently not realizing, or caring, that he was a plant for Kirk.",
		"19" : "As his fill-in was answering questions during a news conference after the parade, Kirk arrived from a later flight and took over midway through. The reporters kept asking questions as if nothing had happened, Salata said.",
		"20" : "Kirk’s N.F.L. career, like those of many other Mr. Irrelevants, was brief. He was cut after training camp that summer, and ended up in Canada, where he played for several years. He died in 2003.",
		"21" : "Mr. Irrelevant has added a dash of whimsy to the rules- and order-obsessed N.F.L. The league provides the platform for the tradition to continue but is not involved in Irrelevant Week, other than to provide items to be auctioned for charity.",
		"22" : "Teams, though, have come to realize that picking Mr. Irrelevant can turn into a media bonanza, so much so that they have tried to trade for the last pick in the draft. There is now the “Salata Rule,” which prohibits a team from deliberately passing on a pick for the purpose of choosing last.",
		"23" : "A few times, the Mr. Irrelevant crown has passed to the penultimate pick. In 1978, for instance, the last player taken in the draft, Lee Washburn, was injured and unable to travel, so Salata flew Kenney, who ended up having a respectable nine-year career as a quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, to Newport Beach as Washburn’s understudy.",
		"24" : "Most players are so focused on trying to prepare for their first N.F.L. training camp that it takes them time to fully appreciate the attention being showered on them as the last pick.",
		"25" : "“Everyone in the N.F.L. is steadfast that if you’re not picked in the first round, you might as well be last,” Hoag said. But celebrating the last pick in the draft makes sense, he said, because “you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than getting drafted in the N.F.L.”",
		"26" : "Hoag has made the most of his odd celebrity. After leaving the N.F.L., he worked in Italy as a model, and appeared on the reality show “Bachelor Pad” along with “The Bachelorette.” He now coaches tennis and works with children with disabilities.",
		"27" : "Salata asks each winner what he would like to do during his celebration. Hoag, for instance, wanted to be the guest announcer on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, which was arranged. At least one visited the Playboy Mansion. Others have taken surfing lessons or visited Disneyland.",
		"28" : "Salata’s generosity, though, has its limits. In 2001, the Arizona Cardinals chose tight end Tevita Ofahengaue last in the draft. Told to his bring family, Ofahengaue, who is from Tonga, where extended families stick together, took that literally and invited 62 people, with 35 friends and additional relatives showing up on their own.",
		"29" : "That led to the “Ofahengaue Rule.” Now, players can bring one person free, but others must pay their own airfare.",
		"30" : "Ofahengaue, who played parts of three seasons and now works as the director of recruiting operations at his alma mater, Brigham Young, said he remained friends with Salata and his family, and was proud that he had been recognized for overcoming the odds and being drafted, regardless of the round.",
		"31" : "“It’s something they can’t take away from me,” Ofahengaue said. “It’s like the ‘Rudy’ story.”"

		"1" : "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — As the Jets entered this year’s N.F.L. draft, they sought an array of young players to rebuild a team that had missed the playoffs for six consecutive seasons and that had recently stripped its roster of expensive cornerstones like center Nick Mangold, wide receiver Brandon Marshall and cornerback Darrelle Revis.",
		"2" : "Although the Jets needed a lot of help at various positions, they appeared mostly set at wide receiver — where a flock of youthful options surrounded the veteran Eric Decker.",
		"3" : "However, the Jets used two of their draft slots to take receivers, a decision that made more sense after they finished drafting and announced that one member of that promising flock, Devin Smith, would not be available this season.",
		"4" : "Smith, a second-round pick in 2015, tore his anterior cruciate ligament, General Manager Mike Maccagnan said. The Jets became aware of the problem at the start of their off-season training activities this month, when Smith “experienced a situation with his knee,” Maccagnan said. Smith underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination that confirmed the injury, Maccagnan said.",
		"5" : "He did not explain why the Jets had not disclosed the injury before. It was revealed only as Maccagnan answered a question about why the Jets had used a fourth-round pick (141st over all) on Saturday to take Chad Hansen, a wide receiver from California.",
		"6" : "That was the second straight pick the Jets had used on a receiver. They selected ArDarius Stewart, a wide receiver from Alabama, in the third round (No. 79) on Friday.",
		"7" : "“We actually think we have a good group of young receivers, plus Eric,” Maccagnan said, calling Smith’s injury “unfortunate” and “a setback.” “I think going into it, we thought, ‘Hey, let’s make this thing more competitive.’”",
		"8" : "The injury puts into question the future of Smith, a prospect whom the Jets heralded as having big-play ability coming out of Ohio State. Smith has torn the same ligament before, during a game in December 2015.",
		"9" : "The Jets did a lot of bargaining during the three days of the draft, making five trades to amass a total of nine picks after entering the draft with seven. They also gained a fifth-round pick in next year’s draft from the Dallas Cowboys.",
		"10" : "After Hansen, the Jets used one fifth-round pick on Jordan Leggett (No. 150), a tight end from Clemson with excellent hands, and another on Dylan Donahue (No. 181), a linebacker from West Georgia. Donahue’s father, Mitch Donahue, played in the N.F.L. as a defensive end from 1991 to 1994.",
		"11" : "In the sixth round, the Jets picked Elijah McGuire (No. 188), a running back from Louisiana-Lafayette. With their final two picks, they took cornerbacks who could fill the hole left by Revis’s departure. Jeremy Clark, from Michigan, was taken 197th over all. Seven slots later, the Jets took Derrick Jones from Mississippi.",
		"12" : "For the first time in five years, the Jets did not draft a quarterback. They appear set to enter the season with Josh McCown, who will be 38 in July, atop their depth chart at the position.",
		"13" : "As Maccagnan took questions on Saturday, he avoided directly discussing the future of defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson, whose behavior off the field has increasingly overshadowed his performance on it. Richardson served a one-game suspension last season under the league’s personal-conduct policy after pleading guilty to resisting arrest in connection with what the police described as a high-speed chase in St. Charles County, Mo.",
		"14" : "Maccagnan pointed out that Richardson was still under contract but said: “There’s a whole off-season ahead of us here. I think we’ll see how it unfolds going forward.”"

		"1" : "The Giants believe they used the N.F.L. draft to address their overriding long-term issue — identifying a potential replacement for their franchise quarterback, Eli Manning — while tending to immediate needs.",
		"2" : "General Manager Jerry Reese on Saturday pronounced himself satisfied with what became a six-player draft class.",
		"3" : "“We always try to get players that can help us now and, obviously, players that can help us down the road,” Reese said after the three-day draft ended. “I think we have a good combination.”",
		"4" : "The draft class’s success may ultimately be defined by the performance of one player. Davis Webb, a raw but strong-armed passer out of California who was taken in the third round on Friday night, will have every move scrutinized as the Giants try to determine whether he can succeed Manning, 36, who has three years remaining on his contract.",
		"5" : "The Giants’ ability to improve on last year’s 11-5 record and on their playoff performance as a wild-card team — a lopsided road loss to the Green Bay Packers — may hinge on whether the other five newcomers can provide quick returns.",
		"6" : "That burden will fall on Evan Engram from Mississippi, a tight end chosen 23rd in the opening round on Thursday night; defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson (55th, in the second round) from Alabama; running back Wayne Gallman (140th, fourth round) from Clemson; defensive end Avery Moss (167th, fifth round) from Youngstown State; and offensive tackle Adam Bisnowaty (200th, sixth round) from Pittsburgh.",
		"7" : "The final three players were chosen on Saturday. Reese stepped out of character to trade places with Tennessee and advance seven slots to choose Bisnowaty. He also sent the Titans the Giants’ seventh-round pick, the 241st over all. That underscored how eager the Giants were to improve their troublesome offensive line, even in a draft considered weak in that area.",
		"8" : "Bisnowaty, who is 6 feet 6 inches and 304 pounds, was a four-year starter at Pittsburgh and played all 13 games at left tackle as a senior. The Giants have been dissatisfied with Ereck Flowers, the left tackle they picked in the first round in 2015, and are considering moving him to the right side. They also added D. J. Fluker, a 2013 first-rounder who can play guard or tackle, as a free agent last month.",
		"9" : "The Giants are not sure of Bisnowaty’s readiness or whether he can prove himself at the demanding left tackle position. Reese, though, did not want to come away from this draft without an offensive lineman.",
		"10" : "The Giants believe that Moss, who became a potent edge rusher when he transferred to Youngstown State after a troubled career at Nebraska, is only beginning to show his abilities. That potential apparently outweighed concerns about his character.",
		"11" : "Moss pleaded no contest to a charge of public indecency stemming from accusations in 2012 that he exposed himself to a student working at a campus store. He worked at a car dealership for a year after Nebraska told him to transfer.",
		"12" : "Reese said the Giants believed that Moss “has everything together now.”",
		"13" : "Moss spoke on a conference call from a Las Vegas hospital, where he was visiting his grandmother. She is recovering from a stroke, Moss said.",
		"14" : "“I definitely learned from everything,” he said during the call."

		"1" : "OTTAWA — Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist glided out for the second overtime and briefly paused, standing sideways in his crease. He had a tense task ahead.",
		"2" : "Lundqvist had already been tormented by Senators forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who completed a hat trick on a deflection with 1 minute 2 seconds left in the third period to send Game 2 of this second-round playoff series into overtime.",
		"3" : "Lundqvist would soon be skating from the ice, heading to a locker room stunned by one more magical moment by Pageau.",
		"4" : "At 2:54 of the second overtime, Pageau, who scored just 12 goals in the regular season, rifled a shot past Lundqvist’s glove side for his fourth goal of the game, sending the boisterous crowd at Canadian Tire Centre into a frenzy and giving the plucky Senators a 6-5 victory on Saturday and the first two games of their series.",
		"5" : "Game 3 is Tuesday in New York.",
		"6" : "“We played well enough to win this game,” a somber Lundqvist said after the game. “It’s really tough to lose. We just have to go home and regroup.”",
		"7" : "Lundqvist and his teammates appeared to be headed for a series-tying win before Pageau, who also scored in the first period, notched his second goal of the game at 16:41 of the third period. He then finished his hat trick by deflecting in a Kyle Turris shot after Senators goaltender Craig Anderson was pulled for an extra attacker.",
		"8" : "The tying goal had left Lundqvist on one knee, seemingly stunned. Two intermissions and a game-winning goal later, he was still confounded.",
		"9" : "“That last deflection, I don’t even know how he did that,” Lundqvist said.",
		"10" : "That was just the precursor to Pageau’s derring-do in the second overtime.",
		"11" : "“We had faith that we were going to come back, and we did,” said Pageau, an Ottawa native who also scored a playoff hat trick against Montreal in 2013. “You just have to keep working, keep pushing. It definitely feels good.”",
		"12" : "For the Rangers, the wrenching defeat sends them back to Madison Square Garden in desperate need of a victory.",
		"13" : "Lundqvist, who stopped only 28 of the 34 shots he faced, accepted responsibility for the unsavory outcome.",
		"14" : "“I wasn’t good enough coming up with that extra save there in the end,” he said. “It’s a tough place with deflections, but I have to find a way.”",
		"15" : "In the first overtime, the Rangers had a golden opportunity to escape with a victory when Rick Nash took the puck from Anderson behind the net. He had a chance to put it in, but it was poked away by Turris.",
		"16" : "Nash’s squandered chance came after a stunning reversal in a third period that began with the Rangers seeming assured of heading back home with the series tied at a game apiece.",
		"17" : "Now they are under immense pressure to rally against the spirited Senators, who are not playing like the underdogs they were considered before the series.",
		"18" : "“Having that resilience is what’s gotten us here in the first place,” Senators defenseman Marc Methot said. “A lot of people didn’t think we’d make the postseason. Here we are in the second round winning games.”",
		"19" : "Michael Grabner opened the scoring for the Rangers with a short-handed goal at 4:16 of the first, and Pageau tied the score with an unassisted goal at 13:59.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LONDON — Even at the end of what must have seemed the longest week of his career, Arsène Wenger had time to talk. His Arsenal team had just overcome Lincoln City, in the quarterfinals of the F.A. Cup, the sort of result that staved off a downpour rather than dispersing the clouds.",
		"2" : "Seven days before that game in March, Arsenal had gone to Liverpool and been duly beaten. Three days after that, Bayern Munich had arrived in London to rubber-stamp Arsenal’s exit, yet again, from the Champions League. The German team won by 5-1 that night, 10-2 on aggregate.",
		"3" : "Wenger, 67, had spent much of the rest of the week cycling through that game, over and over, putting himself through the torture to try to work out what went wrong. For light relief, he watched Paris St.-Germain’s capitulation against Barcelona, a reminder that things could always be worse.",
		"4" : "Beating Lincoln City and securing a place in the F.A. Cup semifinals brought relief, at least, but for a club of Arsenal’s grandeur and ambition, doing so against such a lowly opponent simply meant the pain did not get worse. Wenger — the Premier League’s longest-serving manager, in his job for 21 seasons, 16 ahead of his nearest competitor — knows that full well.",
		"5" : "Afterward, he was in a contemplative, even somber mood, bemoaning — as he often does — that “nothing is good enough” in modern soccer’s frenzied, hyperbolic landscape.",
		"6" : "Few would have expected him to be sociable, but he still extended the traditional invitation to Danny Cowley, Lincoln’s manager, together with his brother and assistant Nicky, to join him in his office. The Cowleys expected it to be a cursory meeting, given “the week he’d had.” They ended up staying for an hour and a half, talking “about training routines, schedules, team selection, the way he deals with the big squad he has.” Wenger even shared Arsenal’s scouting reports on Lincoln.",
		"7" : "That week in March, a storm was raging around Arsenal. Wenger stood in its eye, unfazed, unflustered and unmoved.",
		"8" : "There is an old line about why England, in the turbulent years of the 19th and 20th centuries, never succumbed to revolution: because it rains too much. People tend not to take to the streets if they know they’re likely to get soaked.",
		"9" : "The converse is true of Arsenal. Mutiny has been simmering at Arsenal for a decade, maybe more. Every couple of years, when the time comes to renew Wenger’s contract, to extend his 21-season stay at the club, dissenting voices demand his departure.",
		"10" : "But there is always just enough sunshine to quell the rebellion: a fourth-place finish, another year in the Champions League, maybe an F.A. Cup thrown in for good measure.",
		"11" : "These last two months, the unrest has manifested at almost every game. At the start of April, Arsenal hosted Manchester City. Outside its Emirates Stadium, a van had been festooned with messages demanding Wenger’s departure. Inside, as the club’s chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, was meeting with fan groups, promising that this summer would be a “catalyst for change” at Arsenal, others were handing out leaflets, trying to stir the masses to overthrow the gilded chains Wenger has bound them in.",
		"12" : "Arsenal was in the midst of its worst run under Wenger’s aegis; another defeat, it seemed, might finally tip the club over the edge, into outright insurrection.",
		"13" : "When Leroy Sané put Manchester City ahead, the reaction was not disappointment, or encouragement, but anger. Theo Walcott equalized for Arsenal; two minutes later, Sergio Agüero restored City’s lead. More venom, more poison, more rage against Wenger’s machine. There were jeers at halftime.",
		"14" : "Wenger has long given the impression he would quit if that was the consensus of the fans, but the protesters have never been in a majority. Even now, when one group hired an airplane to buzz over a match against West Bromwich Albion at the end of March demanding Wenger’s removal, another group did the same, asking that he stay.",
		"15" : "Against City, though, the mutineers must have felt their moment had come. More and more “Wenger Out” signs were visible at games; they were popping up across the world, too, in political protests in Belgrade, at soccer matches in South Africa, at WrestleMania. The time for uprising was at hand.",
		"16" : "A few minutes later, Shkodran Mustafi equalized again. Arsenal salvaged a draw. There is always just enough sunshine.",
		"17" : "Early in February, Ian Wright, the ebullient former Arsenal striker, and his wife attended an exclusive dinner at Emirates Stadium. Wenger, his erstwhile manager, was there, too. After steak and potatoes dauphinoise, Wenger gave an address to the room in which he acknowledged that he was “coming to the end” of his career.",
		"18" : "The next evening, Wright was a guest on a BBC radio program. He relayed what Wenger had said and, when pressed, admitted he felt that Wenger had looked weary. “He was fine when we were talking about how the kids were doing, stuff like that,” Wright remembered this week. “But when we started talking football, it was as though he had to take a deep breath.”",
		"19" : "Wenger has since said the meal came at the end of a long day. Wright stands by his impression of Wenger that evening, even if since that point, he said, he has heard “nothing but fighting talk” from him.",
		"20" : "At the time, though, Wright’s comments unleashed a wave of speculation that this time, Wenger was ready to step down. It had long been known that the club had a two-year contract extension ready for him to sign, whenever he had the time; now Chips Keswick, Arsenal’s gloriously aristocratic chairman, had released a statement saying any renewal would be “mutual,” a subtle but significant change of tack.",
		"21" : "Wenger has been asked, every week since, if he will stay or go. His answer has always been the same: All will be revealed at the end of the season. “The way he is dealing with it is fantastic,” said Patrick Vieira, the New York City F.C. manager, who anchored some of Wenger’s greatest teams.",
		"22" : "Wenger’s reasoning is not always consistent — sometimes he says that he has decided, other times that he has not — but most within the club think the silence means he is staying. “He has the air of a man in control of what is happening,” Wright said.",
		"23" : "If he has told anyone, one way or the other, within Arsenal’s hierarchy, the secret is guarded jealously. He has, certainly, not told his players, although he admits they have asked. They are not surprised to be left in the dark: Players do not see him as the greatest of communicators.",
		"24" : "He abhors confrontation, or any sort of awkward conversation: He neither told Gilberto Silva that he was being stripped of the club captaincy — he read about it on the club website — nor, a few years later, informed Per Mertesacker that he was being awarded it. For Mertesacker, the decision was confirmed only when he was asked if he had written his first set of notes for the match-day program.",
		"25" : "Elsewhere at the club, it is business as normal, too. There has been considerable investment into the training facilities and the youth academy. Dick Law, who oversees Arsenal’s transfer business, has been holding meetings with agents; the club is set on signing a left back and going from there. Arsenal may, eventually, appoint a sporting director of some sort. The club is planning for the future. Only Wenger knows, really, if he is involved in it.",
		"26" : "For a man who has devoted his life to his sport, Wenger often sounds as if he loathes vast swaths of it. Not the game itself, but the soccer-industrial complex that has sprung up around it.",
		"27" : "In his news media briefings, he regularly starts sentences with a variation on the phrase “we live in a world:” We live in a world only of winners and losers (August 2005); we live in a world of emotion and excess (February 2013); we live in a world where what is superficial is at the heart of the debate (April 2017).",

		"29" : "But equally, they do not know what would fill the void. It is a theme that recurs in conversations with Wenger’s friends and former colleagues, this sense that he endures as much out of fear of what comes next as love for all he has done.",
		"30" : "Bixente Lizarazu, the former France fullback and now an ambassador for Bayern Munich, has “shared many dinners” with Wenger over the years, thanks to their work together for French television. “Football is in his blood,” he said. “It is in his brain, 24/7. He is crazy about it. It is impossible for him to stop. If he stopped football. …” Lizarazu tailed off.",
		"31" : "At Arsenal, they worry about what the future looks like without Wenger. But Wenger is no less troubled by what the future looks like without Arsenal, without soccer. At the end of the longest week of his career, he could sit and wade through scouting reports for an hour and a half. It is all he knows, all he has known. There will be no sunshine when it is gone."

		"3" : "“I’m not angry,” Sharapova said. “I’d have loved to have used the opportunity when I was ahead in the second set, so I had a bit of a letdown, which allowed her to get back in the match, gain confidence and play well.”",
		"4" : "Mladenovic has been a vocal critic of Sharapova’s return to tennis, and on the eve of their semifinal, she accused her of getting “extra help” because she had been handed wild cards to play at tournaments in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome.",

		"6" : "“If at the start of the week I’d said I’d be in this position, I’d be pretty happy with that,” she said. “The way I played, I was really happy with that. You are never sure what level you are going to come onto the court with, but I feel this is a great base with which I started here.”",

		"1" : "PITTSBURGH — Al Paslow and Joe Peterson, friends since high school, together surfed the real estate and energy bubbles that buoyed the American economy — and together endured losing their lucrative jobs when each bubble burst.",
		"2" : "Mr. Paslow, 61, is a soft-spoken college graduate, Mr. Peterson, 62, a visceral debater who chose work straight out of high school. They both root for the Steelers and squabble about climate change. And 100 days into his presidency, they still share an unshakable faith in Donald Trump: This is the man who can restore the America they miss and cherish, the outsider too rich to bribe and too strong to intimidate.",
		"3" : "“When Joe first told me about Trump, I said no, that guy’s a bragger,” Mr. Paslow said. “Then I started listening to him, and I noticed, he’s a billionaire. If somebody comes along and says, ‘President Trump, I want to keep my plant in China and I want to close my plant here, here’s $50 million,’ he says, ‘I don’t need your money, mister.’ ”",
		"4" : "I first met them at a Trump rally in October in the Western Pennsylvania town of Ambridge, once the vibrant headquarters of the American Bridge Company, where Mr. Paslow’s mother wound cables during World War II. Mr. Peterson proudly wore his Trump-Pence T-shirt; Mr. Paslow a more modest Trump sticker. They had both been out of work for more than a year, laid off from their jobs in oil and gas exploration with two weeks’ notice, no severance, no pension and no unemployment insurance — like many American workers, they were independent contractors, without the protections of full employment. And like many American men, they were now depending on their wives’ jobs to get by.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump came striding into this bleak landscape and offered them hope. He pledged to the crowd that he would bring back the oil and gas industry the very first day he was in office. “Unbelievably, that is exactly what we wanted to hear!” Mr. Paslow said. “Our hearts were uplifted.”",
		"6" : "What struck me that day and in conversations over the next several months was how much it meant to them to be heard and seen, and how durable their trust was, once conferred. Here was a celebrity self-proclaimed billionaire who was paying attention to their fate, their town, their battered industry. They are quick to suspect conspiracy and corruption, in their state and in Washington. They thought even Mr. Trump might have his price — but luckily, it would be too high for most to afford.",
		"7" : "This amalgam of faith and cynicism still binds them to their president. They may not like his tweets — “bad,” Mr. Peterson said in his only criticism — but they consistently give him the benefit of the doubt.",
		"8" : "They dismiss protesters as sore losers, and pundits who attack policy swings as establishment voices bent on sabotage. Where critics point to promises unfulfilled, they see obstacles that are not their president’s fault.",
		"9" : "“I think he’s doing a great job — he needs more help from everybody,” Mr. Peterson said. And if Congress, judges and other naysayers get out of the way, Mr. Paslow said, “then he might go down as one of the best presidents we’ve ever had.”",
		"10" : "When fact checkers pounce, the two men see an insistence on petty detail when they know what their president really meant.",
		"11" : "Mr. Peterson, whose parents voted the straight Democratic ticket, denounced Hillary Clinton as a liar and President Barack Obama as a weakling. Mr. Paslow voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, spellbound by speeches that he said could make you happy and make you cry. In 2016, Mr. Peterson had persuaded his reluctant friend to hear out Mr. Trump, and Mr. Paslow was sold.",
		"12" : "At a dinner with their extended families in December, the two friends were elated at a victory that took them and their country by surprise. Mr. Paslow’s wife, Adele, was outraged by Mr. Trump’s treatment of women, and sparred with Mr. Peterson and her own mother, a fervent Trump supporter. By April, though, she was liking most of what she saw, and believes the nation’s president deserved the allegiance of even those who did not vote for him.",
		"13" : "After the election, Mr. Paslow got a new job researching land titles for oil and gas exploration. He gives Mr. Trump credit for buoying the industry by promising to roll back environmental regulations that stifled growth. Even though Mr. Paslow welcomed the cleanup of a Pittsburgh once so polluted that streetlights went on by noon, he and his friend criticized Obama-era rules they saw as helping scuttle the shale gas boom and putting them out of work.",
		"14" : "“There were thousands of rules; you had to wait six, eight months just for paperwork,” Mr. Peterson said. “It cost millions of dollars.”",
		"15" : "“You couldn’t drill because the owls were mating,” Mr. Paslow said. Or the bats, Mr. Peterson added.",
		"16" : "The only work Mr. Peterson has found in 18 months is in West Virginia, and he does not want to move. He was a “landman,” going door to door asking whether landowners were willing to lease plots for drilling and then dispensing checks. But even in Pennsylvania, he says, he received a death threat from a farmer angry that his wife had been approached. He fears West Virginia would be even more hostile.",
		"17" : "The two friends reminisced about their childhood home on drives through Pittsburgh over the past few months. Though the city has reinvented itself as a center of health care, education and technology, they pointed out the houses that are still boarded up, the old economy and the new bumping up against each other in uneasy coexistence.",
		"18" : "“The things that made this country great are disappearing — factories, jobs, education,” Mr. Paslow said. “Someone could get a job at the mill and live happily ever after. Now it’s Walmart and Best Buy. Come on — a job at Walmart when you could have had a nice life working at a factory?”",
		"19" : "Yet they both set their sights at non-factory jobs when they first started out. “My dad didn’t want me working there because it was bad,” Mr. Peterson said of the mills. Instead, he started out trimming grass at a cemetery and then worked for 20 years in an electric motor repair shop until it folded. Meanwhile, Mr. Paslow set up a company based on researching land titles for the state for eminent domain and highway projects.",
		"20" : "As the real estate market heated up in the ’90s, the two friends teamed up to build databases of available loans to refinance at lower rates, which they sold to mortgage brokers. Mr. Peterson remembered making $14,000 for little more than 15 hours’ work.",
		"21" : "Then real estate foundered, and they had to start over. Mr. Peterson worked at Domino’s and Papa John’s, and set up a small business selling baseball cards.",
		"22" : "A newly booming oil and gas industry came to the rescue. At one point, Mr. Paslow said, he had 60 people working for him researching titles to make sure owners had no competing claims on land that could trip up companies who wanted to drill. “People were hiring their brothers, sisters, ex-wives,” he said. For 10 years, business thrived.",
		"23" : "“Then the bubble broke, and now we’re talking desperation,” Mr. Paslow said. “We got used to having a constant paycheck, got used to having that job, and we didn’t worry. We lost our zest to go out there and be your own entrepreneur.”",
		"24" : "Mr. Peterson is slowing down. He battled pneumonia this winter. “I’m looking for more part time than full time,” he said. “I’m getting older. Everything hurts.”",
		"25" : "He is able to consider part-time work because of his wife’s management job at a telecommunications company. Mr. Paslow’s wife owns a laundromat and manages her parents’ apartment rental business.",
		"26" : "Mr. Paslow is grateful to have work, but he chafes at all the software he has to use, and misses the secretaries who used to help him input data. “It’s giving me headaches,” he said. “Now we’re typists.”",
		"27" : "If they are adrift in a sea of menace, graft and scorn, Mr. Trump is an anchor. “Trump walked in and asked, what you want — that’s what I’m going to give you,” Mr. Paslow said. It’s only been 100 days. They still think he can do it.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "A federal judge in Houston has overturned the county’s bail system for people charged with low-level crimes after finding that it disproportionately affected indigent residents and violated the Constitution.",
		"2" : "The judge, Lee H. Rosenthal of Federal District Court, ordered Harris County to stop keeping people who have been arrested on misdemeanor charges in jail because they cannot pay bail.",
		"3" : "The ruling, part of a civil rights lawsuit against the county, came Friday in a case that began when a woman was arrested on a charge of driving without a license and spent more than two days in jail because she could not post $2,500 in bail.",
		"4" : "Judge Rosenthal wrote in the ruling, “Harris County’s policy is to detain indigent misdemeanor defendants before trial, violating equal protection rights against wealth-based discrimination and violating due process protections against pretrial detention.” She cited statistics showing that 40 percent of people arrested on misdemeanor charges in the county had been detained until their cases were resolved.",
		"5" : "The order is not final; it is a temporary measure as the larger case works its way through the courts. But legal scholars and the groups that brought the case said the ruling was a victory in the movement to  overhaul the bail system that has been growing around the country. Judge Rosenthal’s order came after eight days of witness testimony and the presentation of volumes of evidence — 300 written exhibits, and 2,300 video recordings of hearings in which bail was set.",
		"6" : "The judge wrote that the plaintiffs had “demonstrated a clear likelihood of success” on the merits of their claims against Harris County.",
		"7" : "“I think it represents a real change in our legal system,” said Alec Karakatsanis, the executive director of Civil Rights Corps, a legal nonprofit based in Washington, which brought the case along with another nonprofit, the Texas Fair Defense Project, as well as the private law firm Susman Godfrey. Mr. Karakatsanis described the ruling as a “comprehensive and robust condemnation of the existing money bail system” that would reverberate beyond Texas.",
		"8" : "Harris County is not alone in its bail procedures, but its size and prominence — Houston, the county seat, is the fourth largest city in the United States, and its county jail system is the third largest — make the ruling particularly significant, said Fred Smith Jr., an assistant professor at Berkeley Law School.",
		"9" : "“If a judge is willing to take the time to have the hearing and put out a 193-page order, it’s sort of hard to imagine her coming out the other way down the line,” Mr. Smith said.",
		"10" : "Christina Swarns, the litigation director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who had filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, called it “a shot across the bow to other metropolitan areas.”",
		"11" : "Robert Soard, an assistant county attorney for Harris County, said the county was reviewing the court’s decision and had not decided whether to appeal.",
		"12" : "The practice of demanding money as bail is standard in the majority of jurisdictions in the United States. But a series of lawsuits and a growing body of research has led to questions about its efficacy and potential disparities based on race and income. In January, New Jersey dropped its money bail system for minor crimes, and Colorado has changed its bail systems. The discussion has been percolating in other states, as well.",
		"13" : "The challenge in Harris County has drawn the support of the new sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, a Democrat, and one of the 16 criminal court judges who are defendants in the case, Darrell Jordan, also a Democrat. The other 15 judges, all Republicans, continue to oppose it, a spokesman said. The county has retained Charles J. Cooper, a high-profile conservative litigator, to help in its defense.",
		"14" : "Lawyers for Harris County have pointed out that it has already started making substantial changes to its bail system, including a planned switch to more sophisticated method of setting bail that takes into account how likely an arrestee is to flee or commit a new crime. And they have argued that the county’s policies adhere to Texas’ laws on criminal procedure law, that they do not violate the Constitution and that they are not intended to needlessly detain arrestees.",
		"15" : "The order issued on Friday takes effect on May 15. People arrested on misdemeanors charges are to be interviewed about their financial conditions for an affidavit. Those who have been deemed eligible for release at a hearing will have the option of being released within 24 hours of their arrest, regardless of whether they can afford bail.",
		"16" : "Heidi Li Feldman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the ruling indicated that the lawsuit could open the door to expensive litigation against the county.",
		"17" : "“This gives tremendous force to those pushing for the reforms because they can say, ‘Look, it’s not just an unwise use of county resources, but the lawsuit has cleared the first hurdle of there being a viable extensive money damages claim,’” Professor Feldman said. “The judge has written an extraordinarily thorough, comprehensive, carefully reasoned memorandum in support of the order. Any challenge to it from either side is going to take a serious amount of work and expenditure.”",
		"18" : "The lawsuit was filed in May 2016 on behalf of Maranda Lynn ODonnell, who spent more than two days in jail because she could not afford to pay her $2,500 bond after she was arrested on charges of driving with an invalid license. It was soon merged with another lawsuit filed by Loetha Shanta McGruder — a mother of two who was pregnant when she was arrested and held because she could not pay a $5,000 bail — and Robert Ryan Ford.",
		"19" : "Lawyers for the plaintiffs have contended that about 500 people arrested on misdemeanor charges are detained in the Harris County jail system on an average night."

Once there, the demonstrators let out a collective roar, meant to symbolically drown out the voices of the administration’s climate change deniers.",
		"3" : "The protesters, who had gathered for the latest in what has become near-weekly demonstrations of varying stripes against the president, then offered a chant: “Resistance is here to stay, welcome to your 100th day.”",
		"4" : "Billed as the Peoples Climate March, the demonstration here in Washington, and hundreds of smaller events like it across the country, had long been planned to mark the 100th day of the new president’s term. What organizers did not know, at least initially, was that that president would be Mr. Trump.",
		"5" : "His administration has gone on to begin rolling back his predecessor’s most ambitious environmental measures, renewing fears that government inaction will send the world headlong into an era of rising seas and violent weather.",

I’m showing my daughters we can believe in something and express what we believe in,” said Scott Trexler, who came with one of his daughters and a church group from Rocky Ridge, Md., to march for the first time. He said his faith demanded it. “I believe the environment is important for my daughters and future generations,” he said.",
		"7" : "The demonstration was also being used to gauge what Democrats hope is a blossoming opposition movement to Mr. Trump that they can parlay into lasting political power.",
		"8" : "“There has been devastating news on climate coming out of the White House and Congress, and a lot of people are really angry,” said May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, an environmental advocacy group that helped plan the march. “We can’t deny that is a big part of it. But we want to make a distinction between anger and resolve.”",
		"9" : "The demonstration’s organizers made a point of casting a big net, seeking to make the case that climate change is interwoven with traditional social justice issues like racial, gender and economic inequality.",
		"10" : "The marchers in Washington included Hollywood celebrities and stars of the political left like former Vice President Al Gore and the business magnate Richard Branson. The front of their ranks, though, was reserved for ordinary people: the immigrants, indigenous people, laborers, coastal dwellers and children, who organizers say are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.",

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has appointed one of the chief antagonists of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, as its administrator and proposed slashing its budget by nearly a third, more than any other federal agency. He has signed several executive orders aimed at rolling back President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a set of regulations intended to close heavily polluting coal-fired power plants, and restrictions on vehicle emissions, among others.",
		"18" : "This past week, Mr. Trump signed orders intended to initiate reviews aimed at opening certain protected lands and waters to drilling, mining and logging. His advisers were still debating whether the United States would remain in the landmark Paris climate accord. And on Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it had taken down several agency web pages that contained climate data and other scientific information relating to climate change.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — In his first 100 days in power, President Trump has transformed the nation’s highest office in ways both profound and mundane, pushing traditional boundaries, ignoring longstanding protocol and discarding historical precedents as he reshapes the White House in his own image.",
		"2" : "But just as Mr. Trump has changed the presidency, advisers and analysts say it has also changed him. Still a mercurial and easily offended provocateur capable of head-spinning gyrations in policy and politics, Mr. Trump nonetheless at times has adapted his approach to both the job and the momentous challenges it entails.",
		"3" : "As Washington pauses to evaluate the opening phase of the Trump presidency, the one thing everyone seems to agree on is that, for better or worse, the capital has headed deep into uncharted territory. On almost every one of these first 100 days, Mr. Trump has done or said something that caused presidential historians and seasoned professionals inside the Beltway to use the phrase “never before.”",
		"4" : "He has assumed even more power for the presidency, expanding President Barack Obama’s use of executive orders to offset the inability to pass major legislation and making it more independent of the Washington establishment. He has been more aggressive than any other president in using his authority to undo his predecessor’s legacy, particularly on trade, business regulation and the environment. And he has dominated the national conversation perhaps more thoroughly than any president in a generation.",
		"5" : "At the same time, he has cast off conventions that constrained others in his office. He has retained his business interests, which he implicitly cultivates with regular visits to his properties. He has been both more and less transparent than other presidents, shielding his tax returns and White House visitor logs from public scrutiny while appearing to leave few thoughts unexpressed, no matter how incendiary or inaccurate. And he has turned the White House into a family-run enterprise featuring reality-show-style, “who will be thrown off the island?” intrigue.",
		"6" : "“His first 100 days is a reflection of how much the presidency has changed,” said Janet Mullins Grissom, a top official in President George Bush’s White House and State Department. “The biggest difference between President Trump and his predecessors is that he is the first president in my political lifetime who comes to the office unbeholden to any special interest for his electoral success, thus immune to typical political pressures.”",
		"7" : "In effect, she said, that compensates for a victory he secured in the Electoral College without winning the popular vote. “That gives him as much leverage as someone who won with landslide numbers — and the freedom to govern his way,” she said. “And his voters love him for it.”",
		"8" : "Where Washington veterans fret about deviations from past norms, Mr. Trump’s supporters see a president willing to shake things up. Where Washington cares about decorum and process, they want a president fighting for them against entrenched powers.",
		"9" : "Yet the crockery-breaking leader has shown signs of evolving. The president operating on Day 100 is not the same as the one who took office in January, when he was determined to make nice with Russia, make trouble for China and make war on elites.",
		"10" : "By his own account, Mr. Trump has discovered how much more complicated issues like health care and North Korea are than he realized, and he has cast off some of his most radical campaign promises after learning more about the issues.",
		"11" : "“I’m more inclined to say the presidency has changed Trump rather than Trump changed the presidency,” said H.W. Brands, a University of Texas professor who has written biographies of multiple presidents, including Ronald Reagan and both Roosevelts. “He has moderated or reversed himself on most of the positions he took as a candidate. Reality has set in, as it does with every new president.”",
		"12" : "All the more so for the first president in American history who had never spent a day in government or the military, and surrounded himself with top advisers who had not either. Although Mr. Trump assumed that his experience in business and entertainment would translate to the White House, he has found out otherwise.",
		"13" : "“I never realized how big it was,” he said of the presidency in an interview with The Associated Press. “Every decision,” he added, “is much harder than you’d normally make.”",
		"14" : "In a separate interview with Reuters, he said: “This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.”",
		"15" : "Mr. Trump arrived at the White House unimpressed by conventions that governed the presidency. At first, he blew off the idea of receiving intelligence briefings every day because he was “a smart person” and did not need to hear “the same thing every day.” He telephoned foreign leaders during the transition without consulting or even informing government experts on those countries.",
		"16" : "He badgered specific companies on Twitter about moving jobs overseas and called in the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to complain about the cost of the F-35 fighter jet, never mind that presidents typically do not involve themselves in the affairs of individual companies or directly negotiate federal contracts.",
		"17" : "Mr. Trump likewise has gleefully taken credit on days that stocks have risen and publicly commented on the strength of the dollar, which presidents generally do not do either, both because it might be viewed as unseemly interference in the markets and because it invites blame when they have a bad day.",
		"18" : "His boastfulness knows few bounds. “I truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country’s history,” he said in his weekly address on Friday.",
		"19" : "His Twitter account, of course, has been the vehicle for all sorts of outbursts that defy tradition, often fueled by the latest segment on Fox News. Presidents rarely taunt reality-show hosts about poor ratings, complain about late-night television comedy skits, berate judges or members of their own party who defy them, trash talk Hollywood stars and Sweden, declare the “fake news” media to be “the enemy of the American people” or accuse the last president of illegally wiretapping them without any proof.",
		"20" : "David Gergen, a White House aide to four presidents, including Reagan, noted that Franklin D. Roosevelt talked about the “moral leadership” of the presidency. “Unfortunately, we have lost sight of that vision in recent years, and it has almost disappeared during the first 100 days of the Trump administration,” Mr. Gergen said.",
		"21" : "Another change to the presidency involves Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns — a practice of presidents for 40 years — and his continued ownership of a vast business empire that includes properties both overseas and blocks from the White House. “He has overstepped the ethics limits that have bound all other presidents for decades,” said Norman L. Eisen, a chief White House ethics adviser under Mr. Obama.",
		"22" : "Beyond that, Mr. Trump has been slow to create a structure like those in past administrations. Orders and memos have not always been reviewed by all relevant officials. Meetings are not always attended by key aides who are leery of leaving the president’s side. “The notion of a chain of command is gone,” said David F. Gordon, the State Department director of policy planning under President George W. Bush.",
		"23" : "But if the presidency had grown somewhat stale under the old norms as its occupants increasingly stuck to carefully crafted talking points and avoided spontaneity, Mr. Trump has brought back a certain authenticity and willingness to engage. His frequent news conferences and interviews can be bracingly candid, uninhibited, even raw. He leaves little mystery about what is on his mind.",
		"24" : "“The 2016 election wasn’t a delicate request to challenge existing traditions; it was a demand that our next president do things different,” said Jason Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump during the campaign. “And while the professional political class struggles to understand what has happened to their hold on power, supporters of President Trump — the forgotten men and women he referenced in his Inaugural Address — love the change they’re seeing.”",
		"25" : "Presumably Mr. Trump will remain impulsive and even impetuous, but he has also been open to advice. He was talked out of lifting sanctions on Russia, moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, abandoning the “one China” policy, tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, reversing the diplomatic opening to Cuba, closing the Export-Import Bank, declaring China a currency manipulator and, in recent days, terminating the North American Free Trade Agreement. He may still do some or all of these, but by waiting, he has the opportunity to lay the groundwork rather than act precipitously.",
		"26" : "He now receives his intelligence briefings most days. And aides said they had noticed signs of growth in office, pointing to his decision to strike Syria after it used chemical weapons on civilians and his private efforts to persuade Egypt to release an imprisoned American aid worker. Both cases showed that Mr. Trump “has absorbed the responsibilities of the office and the impact of the decisions he makes,” said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the boss.",
		"27" : "Even if Mr. Trump adapts, though, the larger question is whether the institution will ever be the same. Future presidents may feel freer to make unfounded statements, withhold tax returns or keep private business interests without fear of political penalty. Taboos once broken no longer seem inviolable.",
		"28" : "Still, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and chief of staff for Mr. Obama, said there might be a backlash once Mr. Trump leaves office. “After Trump, there will be a collective desire to return to tradition,” he predicted. “Whoever comes next will be the anti-Trump in style and character. That’s how it works.”",
		"29" : "Karl Rove, the senior adviser to the younger Mr. Bush, agreed. “President Trump will make it difficult for future presidents to step back from the use of social media,” he said, “but it’s very likely the next administration will be more restrained and less personal.” The next president, he added, will probably deploy social media as a premeditated strategy. “It will be part of a plan, not a method of catharsis.”",
		"30" : "Meena Bose, the director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, said Mr. Trump’s presidency so far seemed unlike almost any other, except perhaps Andrew Jackson’s. She noted that Jackson was seen as erratic at the time but was later evaluated by historians as a near-great president.",
		"31" : "“Might the Trump presidency be viewed similarly someday?” she asked. “Difficult to see at the 100-day mark, but that is an artificial measurement, with so much of the presidency still to come.”"

		"1" : "HARRISBURG, Pa. — President Trump came to a farm expo center here on Saturday to celebrate his first 100 days in office by bathing in the support of his bedrock supporters, reprising the populist themes of his campaign and savaging a familiar foe: the news media.",
		"2" : "In a rally timed to coincide with an annual dinner of the White House press corps in Washington, which he declined to attend, Mr. Trump laced into what he referred to as “the failing New York Times,” as well as CNN and MSNBC, which he accused of incompetence and dishonesty.",
		"3" : "“Their priorities are not my priorities, and not your priorities,” Mr. Trump said to a sea of supporters, many in familiar red “Make America Great Again” caps. “If the media’s job is to be honest and tell the truth, the media deserves a very, very big fat failing grade,” he said, adding that they were “very dishonest people.”",
		"4" : "Mr. Trump reveled in his decision to skip the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, describing a scene in which Hollywood stars and reporters consoled themselves in a Washington hotel ballroom, while he mixed with a better class of people in the American heartland.",
		"5" : "The crowd responded with a chorus of boos and chants of “CNN sucks,” some turning to jeer reporters. Mr. Trump was interrupted several times by protesters, who were escorted out of the arena by the police, under a rain of catcalls and shouts that recalled the most bitter days of the campaign.",
		"6" : "Mr. Trump saved some of his most colorful vitriol for The Times, lampooning its sale of its headquarters near Times Square — a “cathedral to journalism” — to move into a “very ugly office building in a very crummy location.” The new Times Tower, designed by the architect Renzo Piano, sits across the street from the Port Authority bus terminal on the West Side of Manhattan.",
		"7" : "“They covered it so badly,” he said of the presidential campaign, “that they felt they were forced to apologize because their predictions were so bad.” The Times did not apologize for its election coverage.",
		"8" : "After a turbulent debut in the White House, Mr. Trump spent the past week celebrating the achievements of his first 100 days. But his rally on Saturday took on a darker hue, filled with anger and resentment. He touched on familiar themes of lawless immigrants, unfair trade deals and a corrupt Washington establishment.",
		"9" : "Yet Mr. Trump thoroughly reversed his hard line on another adversary: China. Citing the support of President Xi Jinping in pressuring the rogue government in North Korea, he said it would have been counterproductive to label the Chinese as currency manipulators.",
		"10" : "“I don’t think right now is the best time to call China a currency manipulator,” Mr. Trump said, adding that the news media had been wrong in saying that he had reversed a campaign promise on that issue.",
		"11" : "Mr. Trump hailed his administration’s efforts to reduce illegal border crossings into the United States, and he vowed to fulfill his promise to build a wall on the southern border. “If the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve it,” he said. “Obviously they don’t mind the illegals pouring in, the drugs pouring in. They don’t mind.”",
		"12" : "To some extent, Mr. Trump’s red-meat tone may have been a political necessity to shore up his base after a week in which he vacillated in budget negotiations with Congress on immediately financing the border wall. His wavering drew charges from conservative radio hosts that he was a flip-flopper.",
		"13" : "The president’s attack on the news media started earlier in the day, when he said on Twitter that the “mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders & great optimism!”",
		"14" : "The split-screen image that followed — journalists dining in black tie at what is normally one of the most fashionable events on the capital’s social calendar while Mr. Trump spoke to the crowd at the farm show center and, before that, toured a factory that makes landscaping and gardening tools — clearly delighted the White House.",
		"15" : "Still, Mr. Trump’s thumb in the eye to the reveling press corps felt a bit manufactured. He spent much of the past week giving interviews to the same reporters he was to snub on Saturday night, including Jeff Mason of Reuters, who serves as president of the Correspondents’ Association.",
		"16" : "White House officials had hoped to further vex the journalists by having Mr. Trump announce news in Harrisburg, which would spoil their evening, forcing them to set down their forks and knives and go to work.",
		"17" : "But a plan for the president to announce in Harrisburg that the United States was pulling out of the North American Free Trade Agreement fell through when Mr. Trump decided, after urgent phone calls on Wednesday from the leaders of Canada and Mexico, not to do it — at least for now.",
		"18" : "The White House then toyed with the idea of having Mr. Trump announce that he was ripping up the Korea Free Trade Agreement. But he stole his own thunder, telling The Washington Post on Thursday that the United States might terminate the five-year-old agreement.",
		"19" : "“It’s a horrible deal. It was a Hillary Clinton disaster, a deal that should’ve never been made,” Mr. Trump said. In fact, President George W. Bush negotiated the agreement with South Korea in 2007, and President Barack Obama renegotiated it in 2010, which is effectively what Mr. Trump is now proposing to do.",
		"20" : "For Mr. Trump, the rally punctuated a week of frenetic, all-hands-on-deck self-promotion linked to the 100-day mark — a stocktaking milestone that he had earlier dismissed as artificial and a “ridiculous standard.”",
		"21" : "On Friday, he taped a weekly radio address in which he declared, with a rare caveat, “I truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country’s history.” He did not say which of his predecessors might have outdone him.",
		"22" : "The choice of Pennsylvania for the rally and factory tour was predictable, given the state’s crucial role in propelling him past Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College. It seemed calculated to produce a reliable crowd rather than, for example, helping the White House turn wavering Republican votes in its effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
		"23" : "It also allowed Mr. Trump to escape the capital on a sweltering day when thousands rallied to protest his policies on climate change. Marching past Mr. Trump’s luxury hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, some carried placards that said, “100 Days of Destruction. Resist.”",
		"24" : "Before his rally, Mr. Trump signed an executive order creating an office of trade and manufacturing policy in the White House. Peter Navarro, an academic who shaped the Trump campaign’s hard-line trade message, is to head the office, raising his profile in an administration divided between economic nationalists and more traditional free-traders.",
		"25" : "“Its creation as a permanent office within the White House sends an important signal to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate trade cheating or allow our manufacturing and defense industrial base to wither and die,” the White House said in a statement."

		"1" : "MIAMI — Thousands of immigrants who joined the United States military with promises of a fast track to citizenship are stuck in limbo as new screening measures have taken far longer than expected, leaving some military members around the nation unable to become citizens or even go to basic training.",
		"2" : "In the Army alone, about 4,300 people are awaiting the completion of their background checks, said Hank Minitrez, a spokesman for the Army. Until they are cleared, they cannot enter basic training or deploy overseas, leaving them stuck on bases if they are on active duty.",
		"3" : "Immigrants must be in the United States legally in order to enlist. But the new vetting measures, begun in the waning months of the Obama administration, have taken so long that by November, the legal status of up to 1,500 people who enlisted in active duty or the Reserve had expired while they waited for clearance, the Army said.",
		"4" : "They cannot legally drive or find work, a problem for reservists, who do not draw a full-time military paycheck. Although the Army is granting some extensions, they could eventually be subject to deportation, the Army said.",
		"5" : "Some enlistees who were at the doorstep of citizenship have had the door slammed shut at the last minute.",
		"6" : "One Army reservist in South Florida who had been scheduled for her citizenship oath on Thursday was turned away. A trauma surgeon in Springfield, Ill., who signed up for the Army Reserve was scheduled to become a citizen on May 5, then learned that his case was delayed.",
		"7" : "Anbazhagan Chinnappillai, who came to the United States from India in 2013 on a student visa, lost the visa when the university where he was studying discovered he had enlisted. His original ship-out date has been postponed indefinitely.",

Legal permanent residents, or green-card holders, have been able to enlist and win speedy citizenship for years under a separate program.",
		"11" : "President Trump has voiced support for letting noncitizens serve in the military, but some — including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, when he was a senator — have expressed security concerns. So did officials in the Obama administration, who added additional screening beginning last fall.",
		"12" : "United States Citizenship and Immigration Services referred calls to the Pentagon. The Department of Defense acknowledged that the new screening methods had caused “some delays.”",
		"13" : "The scrutiny is extensive. According to a lawsuit filed by seven Mavni members who said the Defense Department was improperly stalling them, the investigation covers at least 10 years of finances, education and professional activities, on top of credit and criminal background checks. The individual must complete an exhaustive questionnaire and is interviewed by an investigator, often for several hours. Close relatives, references, employers, neighbors and colleagues are also interviewed.",
		"14" : "The process involves various agencies, including the Defense and Justice Departments, and the sheer volume of applications has resulted in delays, said Mr. Minitrez, the Army spokesman.",
		"15" : "“These background checks are quite extensive and time consuming,” he said in an email, “but are absolutely necessary.”",
		"16" : "Naomi Verdugo, a retired senior recruiting official in the Army who helped create Mavni, said one soldier she knew had an M.B.A. and spoke Ukrainian and Russian, but was sitting around his base with little to do because the military had not completed his background check.",
		"17" : "“He is sitting there, painting rocks,” she said.",
		"18" : "Margaret D. Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who also was involved in creating Mavni, said she believed the government was violating a segment of the law that says Army reservists are eligible for citizenship as soon as they begin serving.",

		"20" : "Sagar Dubey, 31, a computer consultant in Minneapolis who runs a Facebook page for Mavni recruits, said hundreds of reservists had posted desperate messages about running out of money or being unable to leave the country to attend a parent’s funeral because they were no longer in the United States legally and might not be allowed to re-enter.

		"1" : "CAMP SHORAB, Afghanistan — Before the American flag was lowered, folded and retired and the last of the Marines left the Afghan province of Helmand in 2014, their commander offered some optimistic parting words.",
		"2" : "The commander, Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Yoo, said the Marines had done their job, one of the largest undertakings in the force’s history. At the peak of the war in southern Afghanistan, more than 20,000 Marines flooded the Taliban stronghold, pushing the insurgents out of several districts in Helmand. In their place, the Marines helped Afghan forces establish the combination of security and essential services that became known as a “government in a box.”",
		"3" : "Afghan forces would now be responsible for security in Helmand, General Yoo said, “and I am confident in their abilities to continue to succeed.”",
		"4" : "It did not quite turn out that way.",
		"5" : "Since 2014, resurgent Taliban militants have gained territory, and the Afghan security forces have lost men at such high rates that entire units have needed to be replenished. The local “government in a box” arrangements have mostly crumbled.",
		"6" : "So on Saturday, the Marines returned to Helmand with a force of 300; roughly half of them had previously served in the province. The same flag that was lowered in 2014 and then stored at the Pentagon office of the commandant of the Marine Corps was raised again at the 6,500-acre Camp Shorab, which the Marines will be sharing with the Afghan Army’s struggling 215th Maiwand Corps.",
		"7" : "The Marines’ new mission is a difficult one: to assist and train Afghan soldiers and police to defend the provincial capital. The Taliban control seven of the province’s 14 districts and are encroaching on five others. The government fully controls just two, local officials say.",
		"8" : "“It’s kind of disheartening — the sacrifices you and your Marines made, and to see it go back to where it was,” said Gunnery Sgt. Ronnie C. Mills, of Kentucky, who is on his second tour of Helmand after serving three tours in Iraq.",
		"9" : "During his previous stint in Helmand, Sergeant Mills served in Marja, which was the scene of one of the biggest battles in 2010 after President Barack Obama ordered a troop surge to break the Taliban’s momentum. By the end of his tour in July 2011, Sergeant Mills said, the Marja district was “safe enough to walk down the road, to go to the bazaars.”",
		"10" : "Now, the Afghan troops who remain in Marja can be supplied only by air, because the government is struggling to clear and secure the roads leading to the district.",
		"11" : "Nevertheless, Sergeant Mills said he was hopeful that his team, drawing on their experiences in Helmand, could help the Afghan forces. The Afghans have the “heart and ability,” he said, but need to learn how to fight as cohesive units.",
		"12" : "“It will make a huge impact,” he said of the arrival of the 300 Marines. “Everybody here has sacrificed and been here before, and it means a lot to them to see this succeed.”",

Bush.",
		"15" : "But only after Mr. Obama ordered the troop surge in 2009 did Marines pour into the province. In the absence of an Afghan security force, the Marines pushed out the Taliban and created opportunities for Afghans to govern their districts. In the process, about 350 Marines were killed in Helmand and thousands were wounded.",
		"16" : "“Pretty much my generation, when I came into the Marine Corps, all of the people above me had been here, and those were the people I looked up to,” said Cpl. Allan Oshea, of Alabama, who is on his first tour of the province. “When certain places fell again, it brought tears to people that had been here.”",

Sims, the commander of the departing Army unit that the Marines are replacing, described the difficulties his soldiers had encountered since last fall.",
		"18" : "“We spent the first few months in a knife fight with the Taliban, as the enemy pressed hard for Lashkar Gah,” General Sims said, referring to the provincial capital. “The governor and I spoke late into the evening, and early in the morning, with the sound of small arms and RPGs” — rocket-propelled grenades — “clearly audible across the river from his residence.”",
		"19" : "He said he had seen more progress since the Afghan Army replaced a corps commander who is in jail now for corruption.",
		"20" : "But the biggest challenge for the Marines will be to help Afghan forces regain territory and hold it. Abdul Jabar Qahraman, President Ashraf Ghani’s former envoy in charge of operations in Helmand, said that for a long time the people of Helmand had sided with the Afghan forces, but that the government had repeatedly failed the civilian population and “left them handcuffed for the brutal enemy.” He said he expected that the Afghan forces would struggle to regain the population’s trust.",

		"20" : "Many of the factors contributing to the changes in quality of hawker food — a rise in the use of imported ingredients, for example — would probably still have been factors if hawkers had stayed on the streets, said Cindy Gan, a food blogger in Singapore who grew up there in the 1970s.",
		"21" : "“But what you lose is a certain cultural dynamism, I suppose, that you might associate with your childhood,” she said.",
		"22" : "And some experts say street food is not inherently less sanitary than restaurant food. “If you’re eating fried foods or things that are really steaming hot, then there’s probably not much difference at all,” said Martyn Kirk, an epidemiologist at the Australian National University.",
		"23" : "The W.H.O. and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are developing a code for street vending in Asia that would establish best hygiene practices and offer broad guidelines on how governments could regulate the industry.",
		"24" : "Several experts, however, said the recent sidewalk-clearance campaigns were a far cry from Singapore’s earlier effort because they seemed shortsighted, haphazard and biased against the poor.",
		"25" : "“These plans are always announced by people who don’t have to worry about getting their own lunch,” said John Walsh, a professor of business management at Shinawatra University in Bangkok.",
		"26" : "“This makes long-term suppression of street vending unsustainable,” he added, “until we reach a position, such as in Singapore and Hong Kong, where people earn enough that buying from a restaurant on a daily basis is a feasible alternative.”",
		"27" : "Many street vendors are likely to find workarounds, dodging the police when they show up and returning to their stations later. But the cat-and-mouse routine adds an extra degree of uncertainty to an already stressful and low-paying job.",
		"28" : "Ms. Hong, the Hanoi vendor, said her earnings had cratered by about 60 percent since the start of the crackdown, when she moved to her present location from a busy street corner as a hedge against police raids.",
		"29" : "A vendor in central Bangkok who sells green papaya salad and would provide only her first name, Si, said she would consider returning to her hometown in Thailand’s poor northeast if the crackdown intensified.",
		"30" : "Others have no such options.",
		"31" : "“At my age, I wouldn’t know what else to do if I couldn’t do this,” said Nguyen Thi Nga, 55, who was selling oranges and apricots on a Hanoi sidewalk. “Even if I applied for a job, I wouldn’t get it.”"

		"2" : "“I believe he is trying very hard,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. “He is a good man. He is a very good man, and I got to know him very well.”",
		"3" : "That’s heady praise for someone the president had never met before this month. But Mr. Trump’s time as a businessman may help make sense of his backslapping tributes to Mr. Xi.",
		"4" : "In “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” his braggadocious memoir-cum-business playbook from 1987, Mr. Trump explained how he flattered, pummeled, cajoled and bluffed his way to what he wanted. He seems to hope to use the same tactics with China.",
		"5" : "“A little hyperbole never hurts,” he wrote of his deal-making.",
		"6" : "Before the recent courtship, Mr. Trump had little good to say about China or Mr. Xi. In March 2016, Mr. Trump was asked in an interview with The New York Times about his impressions of Mr. Xi. Instead, he vented about China’s trade surplus with the United States.",
		"7" : "“Nobody has manipulated economic conditions better than they have,” he said.",
		"8" : "After Mr. Trump won the election, he kept taking potshots at the Chinese leadership. In December, Mr. Trump had a friendly phone chat with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, alarming Chinese officials, who regard Taiwan as a breakaway province.",
		"9" : "Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had a brief phone call days after the American election, but more than two months passed before they had their next call — their first since the president took office. Mr. Trump said he would honor the “One China” policy, under which the United States does not give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan.",
		"10" : "But even as that issue faded as a source of tension with China, Mr. Trump has appeared increasingly alarmed about North Korea.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "BRUSSELS — The leaders of the European Union met on Saturday in Brussels without Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and unanimously endorsed guidelines to negotiate the end of more than four decades of British membership in the bloc.",
		"2" : "The summit meeting is the first of its kind at which 27 leaders made a formal decision in a slimmed down format, minus Britain and Mrs. May.",
		"3" : "The leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France, backed a tough strategy on negotiating Britain’s exit, or “Brexit,” which could eventually force the government in London to make politically awkward choices.",
		"4" : "The idea is to force Britain to reach a deal on the terms of its divorce before starting talks on relations afterward.",
		"5" : "“Obviously we will stand up for our interests as Britain too will stand up for its interests,” Ms. Merkel told a news conference after the summit meeting. “We’re trying to forge a strong European Union of 27. This is the sort of spirit with which we approach these negotiations.”.",
		"6" : "The adoption of the guidelines was followed by “a general round of applause,” Ms. Merkel noted.",
		"7" : "One of the thorniest issues is getting Britain to guarantee that the three million citizens of other European Union nations who are living in Britain and the 1.2 million Britons living in the European Union can maintain their residency rights and other entitlements.",
		"8" : "Safeguarding citizens’ rights was “priority No. 1,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body that represents the bloc’s leaders, told a news conference after the meeting. “Today’s discussion made clear that when it comes to reaching a decision on citizens’ rights not only speed is of the essence but above all quality, as so many people’s lives depend on it,” he said.",
		"9" : "The leaders also called on Britain to meets its outstanding financial obligations so that other member states can avoid paying higher costs after the British withdrawal. The outstanding bill could amount to as much as 60 billion euros, about $65 billion. But British citizens and politicians are balking at paying such a large sum.",
		"10" : "Another key issue: pushing Britain to maintain a free flow of trade and people between Northern Ireland, which will leave the bloc with Britain, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain a full member of the European Union.",
		"11" : "Britain also needs to abide by the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, including keeping the door open to the possible unification of Ireland.",
		"12" : "In March, Mrs. May formally started the two-year process of leaving the European Union, and the weekend gathering in Brussels is the logical consequence of that step, taken after a majority of the British electorate voted for Brexit 10 months ago.",
		"13" : "Yet, Mrs. May is confronting European leaders who are more optimistic about their joint future than they have been in several years.",
		"14" : "European leaders are emboldened by mostly positive economic news in recent months and by the defeats of ferocious opponents of the bloc in elections in Austria and the Netherlands. The Europeans are also broadly optimistic that Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate in the French presidential elections, will prevail over Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front in the final round on May 7.",
		"15" : "That Mr. Macron is her preferred candidate to become the next French president was not “all that surprising,” Ms. Merkel told the news conference.",
		"16" : "The demand that Britain first make “sufficient progress” on assuring the rights of citizens of other member nations, on settling its bill and on safeguarding Irish peace and prosperity before talking about a trade deal amounts to a blow for Mrs. May. But it seems unlikely to dent her chances of being re-elected in a snap election she called for June 8 in order to have a stronger mandate in Brexit negotiations.",
		"17" : "Even so, Britain badly needs a trade deal, or a transitional arrangement, to avoid facing barriers to the 440 million European Union consumers who are the biggest buyers of exports from Britain after it leaves the bloc, as soon as 2019.",
		"18" : "Although Mrs. May has backed away from suggestions that her country could simply walk away without a trade deal, Ms. Merkel has warned that some in Britain still had “illusions” about what the nation stood to gain during the two-year negotiations.",
		"19" : "Mrs. May has since accused European countries of preparing to “line up to oppose us.”",
		"20" : "Ms. Merkel said she felt the need to clarify that there was “no conspiracy against the British” on the part of the European Union because of its demand for a divorce settlement before a discussion on a future relationship.",
		"21" : "The leaders reached agreement on the guidelines unusually swiftly, in mere minutes, at the start of a working lunch of duckling, and lemon and strawberry sorbet. During the afternoon, they discussed the coming talks with the main negotiator, Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister. Mr. Barnier has said he wanted to wrap up talks by October 2018.",
		"22" : "Much is at stake for the countries remaining in the bloc. They must overcome their habitual squabbling and balance their desire to keep trade and military ties with Britain while ensuring that it does not enjoy the same benefits as a member of the bloc.",
		"23" : "They are also wary of Britain turning itself into a low-tax haven with weakened regulations that would undercut European neighbors.",
		"24" : "Another source of acrimony could be competition among more than a dozen member states to host the European Medicines Agency, which must move from London. A number of states also are competing to host the European Banking Authority, also currently based in London. Mr. Hollande, the French president, told a news conference on Saturday that decisions on the locations for the agencies could be made in the fall.",
		"25" : "Mr. Tusk said quick adoption of the guidelines on Saturday was a sign of “outstanding unity” of the leaders. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, struck a more cautious note at a joint news conference with Mr. Tusk.",
		"26" : "“The negotiations will be difficult, and it will even be difficult to retain the unity which we were able to construct today, but we will do our utmost,” Mr. Juncker said."

		"1" : "MOSCOW — They are small as physician assistants go, about two inches long, and slithery. They wiggle about for a bit on Elena A. Kalinicheva’s back before getting down to what they do best: sucking blood.",
		"2" : "Leeches — yes, leeches — are still widely prescribed in Russian medicine, about 10 million of them every year, in many cases as a low-cost substitute for blood thinners like warfarin.",
		"3" : "“When you do it the first time, you think, ‘My God, leeches!’” Mrs. Kalinicheva said. “But after you go through it, you understand there is nothing to worry about.”",
		"4" : "In Russia, a medicinal leech costs less than $1, and a typical application requires three to seven of the ravenous little creatures. Leech treatments, available throughout the country, take 30 to 40 minutes, though the resulting wounds ooze blood for an additional six hours or so until the natural anticoagulant in leech venom wears off.",
		"5" : "Though Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin is muscling its way back onto the world stage militarily, economic development has lagged woefully, and that includes the medical system.",
		"6" : "In developed countries, leech applications are often, and perhaps unfairly, associated with quackery, like the once popular practice of bleeding patients.",
		"7" : "In fact, leeches are creeping back into Western medicine — as many as 6,000 are used annually in the United States, the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation estimates — but not for the same purposes as in Russia.",
		"8" : "The Food and Drug Administration in the United States cleared the sale of leeches as medical devices in 2004 — along with maggots — while European pharmaceutical companies have focused on isolating therapeutic, blood-thinning chemicals in the venom and delivering it in a less creepy manner.",
		"9" : "The F.D.A. has approved leeches for draining blood, for example using them to remove excess blood from severed body parts that have been reattached.",
		"10" : "In the Russian tradition, the therapeutic benefits are seen in the venom, a natural anticoagulant prescribed as a preventive treatment for stroke and heart disease, at a fraction of the cost of pharmaceutical blood thinners.",
		"11" : "Russians are in theory covered for most doctor care and drugs under a socialized medical system written into the post-Soviet Constitution in 1993. Modernizing this state health care was a priority that Mr. Putin enshrined in decrees early in his third term as president. They set ambitious targets for medicine: Doctors’ salaries would double by 2018, the end of Mr. Putin’s term; life expectancy would rise by four years.",
		"12" : "But the oil price collapse, sanctions and military spending intervened. Russia remains a poor country, albeit one with geopolitical ambitions. The average income in Russia is $642 a month, compared with $3,584 in the United States, according to government statistics in both countries.",
		"13" : "“We need investment, and in medicine new technology requires state investment,” Yevgeny Gontmakher, an economist and authority on the Russian health care system, said in a telephone interview.",
		"14" : "In rural areas, doctors are often too scarce to find in a timely manner. Russian life expectancy for men and women, at 70.3 years, has hardly budged since Mr. Putin issued his decrees and is still 10 years lower than the European Union average of 80 years.",
		"15" : "Similarly, while government-approved “vitally necessary” drugs are theoretically covered, in practice they are as likely as not to be out of stock at the state-run pharmacies that distribute them free. Left to pay out of pocket at clinics or commercial drugstores, patients gravitate toward cheaper options, like leeches.",
		"16" : "Ms. Kalinicheva, a secretary in a Moscow office, said she had suffered from intolerable lower back pain before trying leeches, applied weekly at a walk-in medical center, the Hirudotherapy Clinic.",
		"17" : "She said she had chosen leeches for cost savings and to avoid taking painkillers. “I wanted something natural, to minimize the chemicals,” Ms. Kalinicheva said.",
		"18" : "At the clinic, Dr. Irina A. Pankova applies leeches to treat glaucoma, prostatitis, hypertension and many more ailments. She encourages patients to use them in conjunction with standard drug treatments. As they engorge themselves with blood, the leeches bulge to six to seven times their original size before dropping off. They are used only once, to avoid spreading disease.",
		"19" : "On a recent day, a steady stream of patients traipsed through the door, took seats and flipped through magazines, awaiting their turn.",
		"20" : "Medicinal leeches cost 90 cents each in Russia, compared with $15.50 for leeches sold by Leeches USA, a medicinal leech supplier based in Westbury, N.Y.",
		"21" : "They are raised in leech farms where, in Russia, women in white laboratory coats follow a procedure little changed over the decades.",
		"22" : "They set out glass jars teeming with medical leeches, or Hirudo medicinalis; a colander with a fine, porous surface; a bolt of cheesecloth; and a jug of fresh cow’s blood.",
		"23" : "“The leeches are hungry,” Natasha Bogdanova, an employee of the International Center for Medicinal Leeches, observed as she ladled warm blood into the cloth-lined colander.",
		"24" : "It is not a job for the squeamish. At feeding time, the “leech raisers,” as they are called, plunge their hands into the glass bottles of leeches, retrieve the little bloodsuckers and put them in the blood-filled colanders.",
		"25" : "“I’m not afraid,” Ms. Bogdanova said with a shrug. “I’m used to it. It’s my job. A job is a job.” One leech slithered up her wrist as she spoke.",
		"26" : "In Europe, the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi and AstraZeneca have marketed medicines based on leech venom, delivering the benefits without the actual creatures. In 2016, Sanofi sold 29,300 units of its leech-derived topical ointment, Exhirud Heparin, according to the company.",
		"27" : "Like researchers in richer countries, scientists in the Soviet Union were trying to transform live leech therapy into pharmaceutical products in the late 1980s, said Gennady I. Nikonov, the director of the leech farm, who got his start in a laboratory at Moscow State University trying to isolate medicinal compounds from leeches.",
		"28" : "The effort unraveled with the Soviet breakup and is still foundering for lack of money. Mr. Nikonov has continued the work, and his company has prospective pharmaceutical products but, like so many other areas of Russian industry, lacks investment to bring them to market. That would require expensive clinical trials.",
		"29" : "And so for now the leeches are sold, squirming and hungry, in glass canning jars, waiting for their patients. It works, as it has for centuries. “Why give up the experience of past years?” Mr. Nikonov said, shrugging.",
		"30" : "Mr. Nikonov estimated that Russian leech farms produce 10 million specimens a year; his farm alone accounts for about two million. The F.D.A. does not keep statistics on American leech use, a spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said, but the numbers are small.",
		"31" : "Most American patients “would prefer a pill or something else without the yuck factor,” said Dr. Ronald Sherman, a former professor of medicine at the University of California, Irvine, and director of the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation.",
		"32" : "Some Russians prefer to apply leeches at home. At a store run by the leech farm, Nadezhda K. Loba, 64, turned up with a plastic water jug and an order for 100 leeches. She applies them at home, on her temples, to treat conjunctivitis.",
		"33" : "For an added measure of frugality, Ms. Loba noted, “you can use them repeatedly for yourself,” by departing from clinic practice and saving them after an application.",
		"34" : "“If you take care of them, change their water, they can be used for a long time,” she said. “Think about it: Leeches don’t run out.”"

		"2" : "Ms. Le Pen said she had reached an agreement with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing politician who shares her distrust of the European Union and globalization and who gathered 4.7 percent of the vote, or nearly 1.7 million ballots, in the election’s first round. Ms. Le Pen gathered 21.3 percent.",
		"3" : "Ms. Le Pen, sitting with Mr. Dupont-Aignan at a news conference in Paris, praised him as a “patriot” and said that together they would present a “common project” to help them “claim the patriotic and republican victory that our country needs.”",

		"6" : "Mr. Dupont-Aignan, who heads a right-wing party called Debout La France, or “Stand Up, France,” does not bring with him a substantial number of voters, and most of his supporters were already expected to choose Ms. Le Pen in the second round. But it is the first time the National Front has entered into a formal alliance with another political party with the hope of forming a joint government, representing an additional step in Ms. Le Pen’s bid to “un-demonize” the party.",

The Republican candidate, François Fillon, did not make it into the second round of the elections, and the party has called on its members to vote against Ms. Le Pen.",

And in a joint statement on Saturday, the two said that leaving the eurozone was not a “prerequisite to all economic policy,” a softening of Ms. Le Pen’s previous position.",
		"10" : "Still, the two politicians agree on a vast number of policies, including a hard-line approach to security and an emphasis on the need to increase economic protectionism and to reduce the powers of the European Union, which has become one of the campaign’s major issues. France’s current president, François Hollande, noted on Saturday that the French election was a “European choice.”",
		"11" : "“The choice that is being presented on Sunday, May 7 is to know if the French — not only globally, but individually — have to fear an exit from the European Union,” Mr. Hollande said. “They have everything to gain from remaining in the European Union.”",

		"15" : "Even if Ms. Le Pen were elected and Mr. Dupont-Aignan were nominated to become prime minister, it is unclear that he would stay in the job for long. Although the president nominates the prime minister, that person must reflect the political majority in the National Assembly, France’s lower house of Parliament, to avoid a government-toppling motion of censure.",

		"2" : "The protests, initiated by the Open Russia organization founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, an exiled former oil tycoon, centered on the right of all Russians to present letters listing grievances to the government.",
		"3" : "Some of the protests turned violent. Nearly 120 people were arrested in St. Petersburg, according to O.V.D. Info, an independent organization that tracks protest arrests, and there were scattered detentions in at least a half-dozen other cities. In Samara, a scheduled rally was canceled because of organizational roadblocks put up by the local government, and because a printer backed out at the last minute, Open Russia said.",
		"4" : "Pictures of the protest in St. Petersburg, which organizers said had attracted about 300 people, showed riot police officers hustling protesters onto buses, including one older woman holding a sign critical of President Vladimir V. Putin, which said, “V. V. Putin — there is a way out — take a pension.”",
		"5" : "The overarching theme for the day was “Nadoel!” or “Enough!” as in enough of Mr. Putin and his government. Signs and many petitions called on him not to seek a fourth term in next year’s presidential election. He is expected to run, although he has yet to officially declare his plans.",

Over all, the number of participants was smaller than the tens of thousands who turned out in about 80 cities for protests called by the main opposition leader, Aleksei A. Navalny, on March 26. Mr. Navalny has called for more demonstrations on June 12.",

For a little more than two hours starting around 2 p.m., petitioners filed into a government office to present their letters, many of them written on the spot.",
		"9" : "In the days before the protest, the government had deployed construction equipment and barriers near the office that handles such letters, leaving organizers to believe the entrance would be blocked.",
		"10" : "After word went out that the letters were indeed being accepted, many more people arrived to stand in line. Organizers said that an early count found that at least 1,500 people had presented petitions in Moscow.",
		"11" : "“We must participate in such events to show the authority that more and more people whose rights are being violated are against this,” a 30-year-old marketing specialist who identified herself only as Veronika said as she wrote her letter. Many participants were reluctant to give their names because of the legal problems faced by numerous people who took part in previous protests. “I want to live in a country where laws are observed,” she said.",
		"12" : "Another protester who declined to give his full name, Aleksandr, 26, said he had tried to start an emergency services company to work in gas fields and had been blocked at every turn. “They keep telling me that they don’t have the budget, maybe because the prime minister stole $70 billion dollars,” he said, referring to recent accusations against Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev in a YouTube video produced by Mr. Navalny.",
		"13" : "“The government does not care about ordinary people — about our salaries, medication, our rights, nothing,” Aleksandr said.",
		"14" : "Many of those presenting petitions acknowledged that the relatively low turnout and the government’s general indifference meant the protests would probably not have much of an effect. But they said it was time to start pushing back against an erosion of civil liberties and the country’s poor economic performance.",
		"15" : "Open Russia’s Facebook page had a few suggestions about subjects to be addressed in the petitions, including “We are tired of living on poverty-level salaries and pensions”; “We are tired of listening to lies on television”; and “We are tired of driving on bad roads.”",
		"16" : "Under Russian law, the government is supposed to respond to such letters in 30 days. Two women who were accepting petitions assigned each one a number and gave the writer a slip of paper with a telephone number to call. Few expected answers, especially to the many letters calling on Mr. Putin to quit.",
		"17" : "“They will probably answer that the writer was not suggesting any exact problem so thank you very much,” said Aleksandr Y. Soloviev, 29, the chairman of Open Russia.",
		"18" : "The group’s founder, Mr. Khodorkovsky, a former chairman of the oil giant Yukos, spent several years in prison before being pardoned by Mr. Putin in 2013. Since then, he has lived abroad, becoming one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken critics.",
		"19" : "The anticorruption theme burst into new prominence on March 26, with marches that included many young people in about 80 Russian cities. The protests were called by Mr. Navalny, who was subsequently jailed for 15 days for organizing them. More than 1,000 people were arrested in Moscow alone and have steadily been brought to court.",
		"20" : "Mr. Navalny appears to have hit a public nerve with a series of videos accusing senior government officials of widespread corruption.",
		"21" : "His latest video focused on what he said was a group of four bogus charities that spend more than $66 billion annually to maintain a series of luxurious residences for the prime minister.",
		"22" : "Mr. Navalny was doused with green dye for a second time on Thursday, and one eye required medical treatment. He appeared on his YouTube channel afterward, tinted slightly green, to answer questions from around the country.",
		"23" : "He expressed support for the idea of submitting petitions on Saturday, but he said he doubted that doing so would produce any positive results.",
		"24" : "Asked about the Saturday protest last week, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, noted that it was illegal and would be dealt with accordingly. The police in Moscow repeatedly ordered anyone lingering on the sidewalk to move on, but otherwise treated the protesters respectfully.",
		"25" : "A day earlier, the government had declared Open Russia, which has its headquarters in Britain, an “undesirable” organization, making it illegal for the parent organization to operate in Russia. The main reason cited for the designation was that the group had organized protests.",
		"26" : "In March, Mr. Putin condemned street protests, saying that they would lead to chaos if allowed to continue, noting the violent aftermath of such outpourings in the Arab world and Ukraine in recent years.",
		"27" : "On Friday, Ren TV, a Russian television channel that serves as a cheerleader for the Kremlin, broadcast a documentary that portrayed Open Russia as a collection of criminals and drug addicts who cultivate ties with the United States.",
		"28" : "No reports about Saturday’s protests appeared on Rossiya 24, the main cable news channel. Reports included one about the opening of Fountain Season in the capital, with the water being turned on after the long winter freeze, as well as the bike-sharing system.",
		"29" : "There also seemed to be a less-than-subtle message directed at the protesters, whom the government often accuses of being financed from abroad. The cable station showed a documentary about treacherous military officers who served the enemy during World War II."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "ROME — Pope Francis urged the United States and North Korea on Saturday to defuse their increasingly tense standoff and avert a potentially horrific conflict.",
		"2" : "“I call on them, and I will call on them, as I have on leaders of different places, to work to resolve their problems through diplomatic avenues,” Pope Francis said, speaking aboard his plane as he returned to Rome from a trip to Egypt. Noting that North Korea’s missile program was not a new concern, he added that “things have gotten too hot” and suggested that “the United Nations has the duty to reassume, a little, its leadership because it’s been watered down.”",
		"3" : "During a 30-minute news conference on his plane, Francis, steadying himself through rough turbulence, touched on a number of topics. He said he still had not received a request for a meeting with President Trump; he defended his appearance with the authoritarian president of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; and he again called refugee camps in Europe “concentration camps.”",
		"4" : "Francis partly deflected a question about how he would advise French Catholics taking part in next month’s presidential election, especially with Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate with an anti-immigrant platform, on the ballot.",
		"5" : "The pope said he did not know enough about French politics to respond, but, he said, “Europe is in danger of breaking apart, this is true.” He noted that the migrant crisis fueled fears that destabilized the Continent, “but we mustn’t forget that Europe is made by immigrants.”",
		"6" : "“Centuries and centuries of immigrants,” he said. “It’s us.”",
		"7" : "That inclusive message has proved popular with liberals. But Francis, 80, also repeated language that some have criticized as insensitive or tone deaf.",
		"8" : "Asked if he wanted to clarify remarks he made last week at a special prayer event for Christian martyrs when he said that refugee camps were like concentration camps, a comparison criticized by Jewish groups, the pope said, “It wasn’t a slip of the tongue.”",
		"9" : "“There are refugee camps that are real concentration camps,” he said, adding, by way of explanation, that the refugees were detained in camps and could not get out.",
		"10" : "The pope’s instruction to reporters on the plane that questions be limited to themes touched on during his Egypt visit meant that he skirted some pressing issues facing the Vatican, notably the lack of progress by his commission established to safeguard children from sexual abuse.",
		"11" : "But Francis seemed eager to address one pressing geopolitical issue. He urged the United States and North Korea to step away from the brink and avoid a nuclear conflict that could, he said, be disastrous for “the future of humanity.”",
		"12" : "His comments came just days after Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that there was a chance “that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea.” The president’s remarks seemed to undercut remarks by others in his administration to ease the dispute by raising the possibility of direct negotiations between the United States and North Korea.",
		"13" : "Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first trip abroad as president in May. His exact itinerary is unclear, but he is expected in Taormina, Sicily, for a meeting of the world’s leading economic powers at the end of the month. A visit with the pope is standard for American presidents traveling to Italy, but the two world leaders have a rocky history.",
		"14" : "In February 2016, Francis responded to a question about Mr. Trump by saying, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not a Christian.”",
		"15" : "The pope’s view does not seem to have changed. In one of his Cairo speeches, Francis said: “Demagogic forms of populism are on the rise. These certainly do not help to consolidate peace and stability.”",
		"16" : "All of that has led to doubts about whether a meeting will actually happen. During a news conference at the White House this month with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Mr. Trump said, “I look very much forward to meeting the pope.” Immediately after, Mr. Trump’s spokesman, Sean Spicer, acknowledged that no meeting had been scheduled.",
		"17" : "That was still the case as of Saturday evening.",
		"18" : "“I still haven’t been informed by the secretary of state that a request has been made,” the pope said, “but I meet every head of state who asks for an audience.”",
		"19" : "Francis began the day celebrating an open-air Mass outside Cairo. He told a crowd of 15,000 people who had filled about half of the locked-down Air Defense Stadium that “the only fanaticism believers can have is that of charity.”",
		"20" : "“Any other fanaticism does not come from God and is not pleasing to him,” he said.",
		"21" : "The pope’s message echoed his strong and extensive remarks during the first day of his two-day trip to Egypt, when, in one of the most influential centers of Sunni Islamic learning, he spoke out against radicalism and the use of religious language as a cloak for terrorism and violence.",
		"22" : "On Saturday, he continued in that vein, saying that true faith required “first crucifying our narrow notions of a God who reflects only our own understanding of omnipotence and power.”",
		"23" : "“It is better not to believe than to be a false believer, a hypocrite!” he added.",
		"24" : "People in white hats emblazoned with the message “Pope of Peace in Egypt of Peace,” waved Egyptian flags and released yellow and white balloons, representing the Vatican colors. Above them, military helicopters circled and Republican Guards in dark camouflage patrolled the perimeter.",
		"25" : "“I’m so happy,” said Nabil Shoukry, 55, who wore a scarf adorned with an image of Francis’ face. Mr. Shoukry, a Coptic Orthodox Christian, said he was taking part in the event “for praying.”",
		"26" : "That has been a courageous act for Coptic Christians of late, as suicide bombers have attacked their churches, killing scores of worshipers. Francis mourned those victims on Friday night in a haunting ceremony at a cathedral. Saturday’s open-air Mass took place far east of Cairo, amid long arid stretches of rock, garbage piles and desert in the June 30 Stadium. The stadium is named in honor of the 2013 street protests that preceded Mr. Sisi’s ouster of his predecessor, who was supported by the Muslim Brotherhood, and the military takeover of the country.",
		"27" : "Antonios Aziz Mina, a Coptic Catholic bishop of Giza, called the pope’s visit a blessing that showed solidarity with Egypt’s Christians, especially those killed in recent months by Islamist extremists. But the bishop showed similar deference to Mr. Sisi, who has cracked down on civil rights and dissent in Egypt, often with the support of the country’s Christian leaders.",
		"28" : "“If the Muslim Brotherhood were still around, where would we be?” he said. “We were saved by the skin of our teeth. The Christians and the Muslims, Sisi saved us all.”",
		"29" : "On his plane hours later, Francis suggested that his visit to Egypt should not be interpreted as a sign of support for Mr. Sisi. He did not intervene in local politics, the pope said.",
		"30" : "“I speak of values,” Francis explained, adding that everyone could judge if the country “brings those values forward.”"

		"1" : "“American Gods” brings Neil Gaiman’s acclaimed novel to television and finds unexpected relevancy. And the songwriter known as Poo Bear cracks a window onto his life.",
		"2" : "AMERICAN GODS 9 p.m. on Starz. Neil Gaiman’s beloved 2001 novel comes to the screen, bringing with it a melting pot of themes and music, deities old and new, and the humans — like Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle), an ex-con who hits the road with the enigmatic Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) — who stand in for them. It’s bloody, hazy and somewhat bewildering, particularly for those who haven’t read Mr. Gaiman’s book. “If you’re willing to wait for the story to take shape, there are compensations,” Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. “The action hums along, even if you can’t tell where it’s going, and there’s a welcome edge of humor (not abundant in this genre), especially in the performances of Mr. McShane and Pablo Schreiber as a tall Irishman who calls himself a leprechaun.” Not to be missed: “Gillian Anderson shows up, delightfully, as one of the new gods, who takes the form of Lucy Ricardo in ‘I Love Lucy’ and speaks to Shadow from a display of flat-screen TVs.”",
		"3" : "THE LEFTOVERS 9 p.m. on HBO. As the anniversary of the Departure approaches, Kevin Garvey Sr. (Scott Glenn) — filled with a vision that is either a divine prophecy or outright insanity — wanders through the Australian Outback as he tries to save the world from apocalypse.",
		"4" : "CAROL (2015) 10 p.m. on TMC. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), a glamorous New Jersey suburbanite whose sexual desires are destroying her marriage and jeopardizing her future with her daughter, enters into a scandalous love affair with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a lonely department store clerk who’s quietly rebelling against expectations. Todd Haynes’s sumptuous romance, spun from the Patricia Highsmith novel “The Price of Salt,” is set in 1952, the year the American Psychiatric Association proclaimed homosexuality a “sociopathic personality disturbance.” “At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, ‘Carol’ is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times.",

Poo Bear — songwriter for Justin Bieber, Usher, Jill Scott and Chris Brown — opens the door to his recording studio, where he schedules four or five daily sessions on a quest to create his next big hit. That’s just half of the fear factor. The other: his pending marriage.",

Catch all three installments of this British serial-killer thriller, which ended its second season with the resident psychopath, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan), bleeding out in the arms of Stella Gibson, Gillian Anderson’s chilly, enigmatic police investigator, brought in to ignite a stalled murder case in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Officially, it’s the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, a black-tie extravaganza held the first Monday in May to raise money for the Costume Institute (a.k.a. the fashion department), the only one of the Met’s curatorial departments that has to fund itself.",
		"2" : "Unofficially, the night’s festivities have been called many things, including “the party of the year,” “the Oscars of the East Coast” (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, in which guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum) and, somewhat pointedly, “an A.T.M. for the Met,” the last by the publicist Paul Wilmot.",
		"3" : "The party signals the opening of the Costume Institute’s annual blockbuster show, and it is known for its celebrity and fashion hosts. This year, the exhibition is “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” and the hosts are Anna Wintour (the Wizard of Oz for this particular event), Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams; honorary chairwomen are Ms. Kawakubo and Caroline Kennedy, the former United States ambassador to Japan.",
		"4" : "Why is it called the party of the year?",
		"5" : "Ms. Wintour, the editor of American Vogue and the artistic director of Condé Nast, took over as chairwoman of the gala in 1999. Since then, she has been instrumental in transforming a local philanthropic event into the ultimate global celebrity/power cocktail: Take a jigger of famous names from fashion, add film, politics and business, and mix. It’s such a heady combo that President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, during the gala in 2004. (In case you are wondering: No, they are not expected this year.) It is among the hardest party tickets of the year to get — and thus, intensely coveted.",
		"6" : "What’s so important about Rei Kawakubo? Who is she?",
		"7" : "Ms. Kawakubo is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who founded her label, Comme des Garçons, in 1969, and she will be only the second living designer to be given a solo show at the Met. (The first was Yves Saint Laurent in 1983.) She routinely ends up on every list of “most influential designers of the 20th century” — and, now, the 21st — in large part because she refuses to accept any of the rules that govern normal clothing design: that clothes need to be flattering, for example, or that they need to have armholes. Instead, she is interesting in challenging our ideas about what defines beauty, identity and gender. She goes where most other designers fear to tread, which is to say, into the realm of clothes that look really, really weird. (Once, when describing a collection, she said she was trying “not to make clothes.”) But she may also finally put to rest the question: Is fashion art?",
		"8" : "Besides, know this: She also runs a multimillion-dollar international business full of lots of wearable stuff, and collaborates regularly with Nike and Speedo. If you ever see someone in a blue and white striped T-shirt with a google-eyed heart logo on the breast, that is one of hers. So are all the Dover Street Markets around the world.",
		"9" : "How much does the gala cost?",
		"10" : "Tickets this year are $30,000 apiece, and tables are about $275,000. The party and exhibition are sponsored, so all of the money from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute. Last year, approximately $13.5 million was raised. In past years, there was one main corporate underwriter per show, alongside Ms. Wintour’s employer, Condé Nast. Last year it was Apple, but this year the burden is being divided among Apple, Condé Nast, Farfetch, H & M and Maison Valentino.",
		"11" : "Of course, not everyone pays for a ticket. Brands often invite celebrities to sit at their table, and Ms. Wintour also often invites up-and-coming designers who may not be able to afford a ticket and scatters them around the event.",
		"12" : "How many people attend?",
		"13" : "Last year, about 600. This year, a spokeswoman for the museum said it wanted to keep it more “intimate” and “private,” so the number will be slightly lower.",
		"14" : "So if I can afford a ticket, can I go?",
		"15" : "Dream on. Unlike other cultural fund-raisers, like the New York City Ballet gala or the Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball, the Met gala is invitation-only, and there is a waiting list to get on the list. Qualifications for inclusion have to do with buzz and achievement (and beauty) more than money. Ms. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee, which means that even if a company buys a table, it cannot choose everyone who sits at its table: It must clear the guest with her and Vogue.",
		"16" : "O.K., you’re saying I can’t go. So why should I care?",
		"17" : "It’s reality TV at its most glamorous. Watch Selena Gomez cuddle with the Weeknd! See Future schmooze with Rihanna! Check out Chelsea Clinton kissing Diane von Furstenberg! Judge whether you approve of the outfits! (And where can you watch? We will be streaming a portion of it around 7:15 p.m. on Facebook Live at facebook.com/nytimesstyles, or on E!, starting at 7:30 p.m.)",
		"18" : "Speaking of outfits, do attendees have to dress in theme?",
		"19" : "It isn’t explicitly stated that attendees have to dress like the exhibition, but it is encouraged. This can backfire. In 2015, the exhibition was “China: Through the Looking Glass,” and it created some politically incorrect moments when celebrities and the designers who dressed them got their Asian references muddled. (Lady Gaga, for example, wore a Balenciaga kimonolike look, which seemed to lean toward the Japanese; ditto Georgia May Jagger in Gucci.) Last year, the show was “Manus ex Machina,” which meant everyone started thinking silver and circuitry. Almost the entire Jenner-Kardashian clan was in sparkling Balmain motherboards. Zayn Malik looked like a Versace version of the Tin Man.",
		"20" : "All of that may pale, however, compared with what we will see this year. Why? Because, in honor of Ms. Kawakubo’s own desire to push boundaries — this has resulted in dresses that sprouted lumps and bumps on odd parts off the body, dresses that turned women into flat-packed paper dolls and dresses that turned wedding dresses into cages — guests are being encouraged to think “avant-garde.” Just ruminate on that for a moment.",
		"21" : "Generally, it is advisable to play it safe and get really, really dressed up. Ms. Kawakubo herself almost always wears a long pleated skirt, white shirt and leather motorcycle jacket. It’s unclear if even this black-tie event will be any different.",
		"22" : "What about celebrities?",
		"23" : "If celebrities are invited to the gala by a brand, it is an unspoken rule that they have to wear clothes from that brand. This encourages brands to get the best stars, because they can act as something of an advertisement for a house. It is also why, whenever designers are photographed on the red carpet, their “dates” are almost always famous people. Last year, for example, Riccardo Tisci, then Givenchy’s designer, brought Madonna; Jeremy Scott brought Nicki Minaj; Michael Kors brought Zendaya.",
		"24" : "Ms. Kawakubo is famous for not playing the celebrity game, but Lady Gaga and Ms. Perry have both worn her clothes in the past. This year, you can also expect a fair amount of Valentino, given that the company is an underwriter. For the last few years, Beyoncé has made the final entrance, but since she is about to have twins, she may well be sitting this one out. Which means the race to take her place in that power position will be something to see.",
		"25" : "How long has this been going on?",
		"26" : "The publicist Eleanor Lambert started the gala in 1948 as a typical philanthropic endeavor for the great and good of New York society. Pat Buckley, the wife of the conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., took over as chairwoman in 1979, but it has morphed into its current form only since the turn of the millennium. Ms. Wintour now oversees every detail, down to timed entrances for guests.",
		"27" : "What happens when guests get inside?",
		"28" : "It’s a secret! For the past two years, posting on social media has been banned after the red carpet. What I can tell you is this: There is a receiving line inside with the hosts, and guests have to file by and air-kiss them. Then they tour the exhibition on their way to the cocktail party, so they are at least theoretically forced to see the culture. After cocktails, they are called in to dinner, and there is always some form of entertainment. (Last year, it was Rihanna.) This is good, because as the red carpet part of the evening has become a giant marketing event — live streamed on a variety of sites and shown on E!, just like the Oscars — the fact that the main part of the event is private allows guests to relax and have fun.",
		"29" : "Or so they tell me."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "PURCHASE, N.Y. — For its recent accepted-students day, Purchase College, part of the State University of New York, had the usual array of inducements aimed at persuading admitted high school seniors to attend, including tours, sample classes and a jazz trio serenading families during lunch.",
		"2" : "But it also had a potent new weapon: New York State’s Excelsior Scholarship, which this year will offer free tuition at the state’s public colleges and universities for in-state students from households earning up to $100,000. At Purchase, a four-year liberal arts college, and other SUNY schools, it is worth close to $6,500.",
		"3" : "The program is the first in the nation to offer free tuition at a state’s two- and four-year publicly funded schools. It was enacted just weeks before the May 1 deadline for most students to decide where they will matriculate, a choice that for many families involves weighing one school’s financial aid package against another’s.",
		"4" : "Though it is still too early to know how the program will shape college attendance in the state, if Purchase’s accepted-students day was any indication, the promise of free tuition seemed a powerful lure for students and parents considering New York’s public campuses.",
		"5" : "That was the case for Jasmine Yanase, who would qualify for the Excelsior program and was choosing between Purchase, which has a national reputation for its programs in the fine and performing arts, and the private Mannes School of Music (part of the New School). At Mannes, where tuition is about $45,000 a year, she had been offered $15,000 in financial aid.",
		"6" : "With Excelsior, Jasmine, a violinist and senior at the Bronx High School of Science, could afford to live on Purchase’s campus in Westchester County, where room, board and fees ran just under $15,000 this year. Though she would commute from home to Mannes, Purchase would still be cheaper.",
		"7" : "“I’m definitely in love with this school,” Jasmine said after finishing a tour of Purchase’s campus. “I’m just waiting to see if Mannes is worth the money.”",
		"8" : "Parents, too, at Purchase were warming to the idea of free tuition. Harry Martinian of Elmont said he and his wife, Anna, had expected to “shell out a considerable amount of money” for their son Otto’s tuition. An aspiring lighting designer, Otto was also accepted at Adelphi University, a private school where tuition would run about $15,000 a year after financial aid was factored in. Like Jasmine, he could not afford to live on campus at the private college.",
		"9" : "Before the Excelsior program, Otto was counting on $3,000 in financial aid from state and federal sources toward tuition at Purchase, currently $6,470. Now, the new program would fill in the remaining gap.",
		"10" : "“It’s a relief,” Otto said.",
		"11" : "The family had no problem with the requirement that program participants live and work in-state for a number of years equal to how long they received the scholarship money, or have it convert to a loan.",
		"12" : "“This is smart government because it keeps the talent where it belongs,” Mr. Martinian said in reference to the residency requirement.",
		"13" : "Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has made Excelsior the centerpiece of his middle-class agenda, saying it will “make college accessible to thousands of working and middle class students” who might otherwise not be able to afford to attend. The program’s passage was hailed by Hillary Clinton, among others, for opening up college opportunities, but critics have complained that it does little to ease the college burden for the state’s poorest students. (By 2019, the income cap for the scholarship will rise to $125,000.)",
		"14" : "Some have argued that the tens of millions of dollars allotted for the program this year should be used instead to help low-income students pay for room and board, which is generally not covered by existing state and federal financial-aid programs. Others faulted the scholarship’s stringent eligibility requirements, including full-time enrollment and the need to stay in the state after graduation. Still others worried that the program would siphon students from New York’s private colleges, putting their financial viability in jeopardy.",
		"15" : "At Purchase, college officials estimated that 2,100 of the 4,000 undergraduates, including incoming freshmen and returning students, would qualify for the Excelsior scholarship, which is designed to fill the gaps of tuition costs not covered by financial aid.",
		"16" : "Dennis Craig, the college’s vice president for student affairs and enrollment management, estimated that two-thirds of those 2,100 students also would qualify for the state’s Tuition Assistance Program and federal Pell grants, meaning the Excelsior money would be the “last dollar” and cover whatever the other programs did not. The remaining students would not have received any aid in previous years because their family’s earnings would have left them ineligible for tuition assistance or Pell grants. Now the state will pay their tuition.",
		"17" : "“They would be taking out loans ordinarily,” Mr. Craig said. “They are people pretty close to the top of the income bracket.”",
		"18" : "The program, which was announced after students had been accepted, added an unexpected variable into carefully worked out equations colleges use to estimate how many students will accept offers of admission. Too few students and a college comes up short on revenue. Too many and three students are suddenly squeezing into dorm rooms meant for two.",
		"19" : "“As an enrollment manager, I worry about everything,” Mr. Craig said. “We put our best foot forward and select a class that we think is good fit for the college and the student. Then there is a piece of this that is a little bit a roll of the dice.”",
		"20" : "Stephanie McCaine, the college’s director of admissions, anticipated that the program would have a more decisive effect next year, since news of the program broke well after application season. The college is hoping for a final head count of about 760 freshmen this fall.",
		"21" : "“There’s only so much we can do to control human behavior, and there are many other factors that go into a decision,” she said. “I don’t think it will overwhelm us.”",
		"22" : "Dozens of students called the college to find out about the program in the days after it was enacted, and on accepted-students day a good chunk of a panel on financial aid was devoted to explaining how it would work. The state’s Higher Education Services Corporation is preparing an Excelsior application that should be ready by the end of May, and students will be notified after that.",
		"23" : "Jacob Ebel of Hudson, who plans to study guitar and psychology, admitted that the prospect of a tuition-free college experience was seductive. He would qualify for the Excelsior scholarship, but if he became a professional musician after graduating, he might not want to be tied to New York.",
		"24" : "“That sort of freaks me out,” he said, adding that the cost of college was nonetheless a “big factor in my decision.”",
		"25" : "Jacob was deciding among several SUNY schools and Ithaca College, a private school where financial aid would cut the cost of tuition, room and board in half, to about $30,000 a year. For his parents, Bill and Janet Ebel, who have put two older children through college, the cost difference is significant.",
		"26" : "Mr. Ebel, a building contractor and teacher who attended Princeton University, said the new state tuition program was “very attractive.”",
		"27" : "“It’s huge,” said Mrs. Ebel, a mortgage broker. “We’re in that sweet spot where we don’t make $250,000 a year and we don’t qualify for free giveaways, either. We are the epitome of New York’s middle class.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LOS ANGELES — Cristina’s husband had hit and threatened her repeatedly for years, she said, but it wasn’t until last year that she began to fear for the safety of her young children, too. Reluctantly, she reported him and filed a police report.",
		"2" : "Cristina, an immigrant from Mexico who arrived in the United States as a teenager in the 1980s, began to apply for a special visa for victims of abuse that would set her on a path to citizenship and her own freedom. Then last month, she told her lawyer that she no longer wanted to apply. She was too fearful, she said, not of her husband, but of the government.",
		"3" : "“I am scared they will find me,” Cristina, who lives in a suburb of Los Angeles, said in an interview, asking that her last name not be used.",
		"4" : "Domestic violence has always been a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute. It often takes victims years to seek help, and they frequently have to be persuaded to testify against their assailants. And for many undocumented victims, taking that step has become exceedingly difficult because of fears that the government will detain and deport them if they press charges, according to law enforcement officials, lawyers and advocates from across the country.",
		"5" : "Since the presidential election, there has been a sharp downturn in reports of sexual assault and domestic violence among Latinos throughout the country, and many experts attribute the decline to fears of deportation. Law enforcement officials in several large cities, including Los Angeles, Houston and Denver, say the most dangerous fallout of changes in policy and of harsh statements on immigration is that fewer immigrants are willing to go to the police.",
		"6" : "The number of Latinos reporting rapes in Houston has fallen by more than 40 percent this year from the same period last year, Art Acevedo, chief of the Houston Police Department, said this month. The drop, he added, “looks like the beginnings of people not reporting crime.”",
		"7" : "In Los Angeles this year, reports of domestic violence among Latinos have dropped by 10 percent and reports of sexual assault by 25 percent from a year ago, declines that Charlie Beck, the chief of the Police Department, said were likely due to fear of the federal government. Dozens of service providers and lawyers interviewed said immigrant women were deciding not to report abuse or press charges.",
		"8" : "“We’ve always told our clients that even if you are undocumented, you don’t need to worry about it — the officers are going to protect you,” said Kate Marr, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, Calif. The level of fear now, however, is unlike anything Ms. Marr has seen in her nearly two decades of work with domestic violence survivors, she said.",
		"9" : "“Everything we’ve ever told our clients is out the window,” she said. “It’s so demoralizing and so frightening to imagine what happens if it continues.”",
		"10" : "The fear among immigrants was exacerbated by a case in El Paso, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a woman in February moments after she received a protective order against the man she said had abused her. The United States Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan independent agency, urged federal officials this past week to reconsider their courthouse arrest tactics. The agency said the Texas case and other courthouse arrests were having a chilling effect on immigrants throughout the country.",
		"11" : "The Department of Justice declined to comment on the concerns about increased fear among immigrants.",
		"12" : "Laura’s House, which helps hundreds of victims of domestic violence in Orange County each year, routinely asks clients about their immigration status so it can help them apply for visa protections if necessary. Under what is known as a U visa, victims of certain crimes receive permission to stay in the United State if they assist the police — and the promise of the visa often persuades victims of sexual assault and domestic violence to come forward.",
		"13" : "Previously, nearly half of the more than 70 new cases that Laura’s House received each month came from undocumented immigrants. In the last three months, that number has dropped to less than one a week.",
		"14" : "Many women share the concerns of April, 23, who waited for years before pressing charges against the father of her children and who asked that her full name not be used.",
		"15" : "“I would call the police and use another name or make a neighbor call,” said April, who came across the border from Mexico when she was about 8 and lives in Orange County. “When he came after me, he’d say that I would get sent back to Mexico and never see my kids again. I believed him for a long time.”",
		"16" : "Capt. James Humphries, who oversees the special victims investigations division in Montgomery County, Md., said he saw the willingness to report drastically backsliding in the county, where immigrants make up a large portion of the population. His unit has received roughly half the calls for sexual assault and domestic violence this year that it did in the same period last year, he said.",
		"17" : "“It’s a constant challenge for us to reassure the community that the way we work has not changed and that the White House cannot dictate to us how to police,” Captain Humphries said. “It affects all crimes across the board, but if you don’t have domestic victims coming forward, the reality is that they do not trust the police.”",
		"18" : "However, Sheriff Chuck Jenkins of nearby Frederick County, Md., has been a vocal proponent of strict immigration enforcement and said he had seen no evidence of decreased crime reporting among the immigrants there.",
		"19" : "“They don’t want to be victimized by anyone else,” Sheriff Jenkins said. “Nothing that we do on the streets has anything to do with immigration status, and folks in the immigrant communities, both legal and illegal, are smart enough to know that.”",
		"20" : "Still, others who work with victims say the impact of the fear is difficult to overstate.",
		"21" : "In Austin, Tex., the nonprofit organization Stop Abuse for Everyone provides forensic exams for sexual assault survivors, and more than half of the clients are Latino. While the organization does not have precise numbers, Kelly White, the chief executive, said that fewer rape victims were coming forward this year, and that many call the organization’s hotline for support but say they do not want to contact law enforcement.",
		"22" : "In Nassau County on Long Island, N.Y., the district attorney’s Office of Immigrant Affairs tip line for crime victims used to get up to 10 calls a week. But it has had none since December. And at End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, which helps about 700 women a year get restraining orders against their partners, the requests this year have dropped to almost zero, the lead attorney there said.",
		"23" : "The Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council typically received about a half-dozen calls a week, with at least half from Spanish speakers. But since January, it has received only two calls, said Olivia Rodriguez, the executive director.",
		"24" : "“This is not normal,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “They assume that if they call a government entity it’s all connected, that they will be reported to ICE and sent away. So instead they are just taking the abuse.”",
		"25" : "Yanet, 56, who asked that her last name not be used out of fear of deportation, said she had endured more than a decade of abuse from her husband in El Salvador, where victims of assault have little recourse, before she decided to flee to the United States several years ago. She mostly worked as a cook in Los Angeles kitchens and in 2005 tried to obtain a visa meant for women escaping violence.",
		"26" : "But the lawyer she went to tried to force her to perform oral sex in exchange for his help, she said. Yanet initially worried about reporting him to the police, but she did file a report after deciding she would not be victimized again. Now she is reluctant to move ahead with both the charges and her visa application.",
		"27" : "“Every day I am scared that something will happen and afraid to even walk out of the door,” she said. “Doing something to get the attention of the government is worse. I don’t know who to believe or what is safe to do to protect myself.”",
		"28" : "Worries over deportation will only increase the feelings of fear and isolation for victims of sexual assault or domestic violence, said Wanda Lucibello, a former prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney’s office.",
		"29" : "For years, Ms. Lucibello said, the office and other local law enforcement worked to make people feel comfortable that they could report crimes without fear that they would then become a target for deportation. Under the Obama administration, victims of crime were not considered a priority for deportation, and many local law enforcement agencies went out of their way to make inroads with immigrants.",
		"30" : "“When you’re talking about immigrant communities, you’re talking about perceptions and whether those perceptions are accurate or not,” Ms. Lucibello said. “If the perception is that there is a greater risk if you go to the police, you are going to be less likely to do so, and you are more likely to stay in an abusive relationship until you need to seek treatment at a hospital.”",
		"31" : "She added: “It’s really the opposite of what anyone should want. All of this strengthens the abusive partner.”"

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump on Saturday invited the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, embracing an authoritarian leader who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects and who crudely disparaged Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.",
		"2" : "Mr. Trump had a “very friendly conversation with Mr. Duterte,” according to a statement issued by the White House late Saturday. It said that the two leaders “discussed the fact that the Philippines is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.”",
		"3" : "In fact, Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs has resulted in the deaths of several thousand people suspected of using or selling narcotics, as well as others who may have had no involvement with drugs. Human rights groups and many Western governments have condemned Mr. Duterte for the bloody campaign.",
		"4" : "A spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Ernesto Abella, confirmed the White House invitation, saying that Mr. Trump had expressed “his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter” of drugs.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump’s embrace of the Philippine leader comes a week after Mr. Trump called to congratulate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for his victory in a disputed referendum that cemented his autocratic rule. He has also lavishly praised President Xi Jinping of China in recent days for his cooperation in pressuring North Korea, overlooking the fact that Mr. Xi, too, has shown an increasingly repressive streak in his country.",
		"6" : "Mr. Trump has spoken warmly of the Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who seized power in a military coup. And he vowed during the presidential campaign to reset relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.",
		"7" : "An outspoken populist with a shoot-from-the-hip style, Mr. Duterte shares some characteristics with Mr. Trump. That was not the case with Mr. Obama, whom Mr. Duterte called a “son of a whore” when he was asked how he would react if Mr. Obama raised human rights issues with him. He later apologized, and his aides said his comment was an expression of frustration rather than a personal attack against the American president.",
		"8" : "In its statement, the White House suggested that Mr. Trump was eager to mend relations. The president’s invitation, it said, was aimed at discussing “the importance of the United States-Philippine alliance, which is now headed in a very positive direction.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "JOAL, Senegal — Once upon a time, the seas teemed with mackerel, squid and sardines, and life was good. But now, on opposite sides of the globe, sun-creased fishermen lament as they reel in their nearly empty nets.",
		"2" : "“Your net would be so full of fish, you could barely heave it onto the boat,” said Mamadou So, 52, a fisherman in Senegal, gesturing to the meager assortment of tiny fish flapping in his wooden canoe.",
		"3" : "A world away in eastern China, Zhu Delong, 75, also shook his head as his net dredged up a disappointing array of pinkie-size shrimp and fledgling yellow croakers. “When I was a kid, you could cast a line out your back door and hook huge yellow croakers,” he said. “Now the sea is empty.”",
		"4" : "Overfishing is depleting oceans across the globe, with 90 percent of the world’s fisheries fully exploited or facing collapse, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. From Russian king crab fishermen in the west Bering Sea to Mexican ships that poach red snapper off the coast of Florida, unsustainable fishing practices threaten the well-being of millions of people in the developing world who depend on the sea for income and food, experts say.",
		"5" : "But China, with its enormous population, growing wealth to buy seafood and the world’s largest fleet of deep-sea fishing vessels, is having an outsize impact on the globe’s oceans.",
		"6" : "Having depleted the seas close to home, Chinese fishermen are sailing farther to exploit the waters of other countries, their journeys often subsidized by a government more concerned with domestic unemployment and food security than the health of the world’s oceans and the countries that depend on them.",
		"7" : "Increasingly, China’s growing armada of distant-water fishing vessels is heading to the waters of West Africa, drawn by corruption and weak enforcement by local governments. West Africa, experts say, now provides the vast majority of the fish caught by China’s distant-water fleet. And by some estimates, as many as two-thirds of those boats engage in fishing that contravenes international or national laws.",
		"8" : "China’s distant-water fishing fleet has grown to nearly 2,600 vessels (the United States has fewer than one-tenth as many), with 400 boats coming into service between 2014 and 2016 alone. Most of the Chinese ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as Senegalese boats catch in a year, costing West African economies $2 billion a year, according to a new study published by the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.",
		"9" : "Many of the Chinese boat owners rely on government money to build vessels and fuel their journeys to Senegal, a monthlong trip from crowded ports in China. Over all, government subsidies to the fishing industry reached nearly $22 billion between 2011 and 2015, nearly triple the amount spent during the previous four years, according to Zhang Hongzhou, a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.",
		"10" : "That figure, he said, does not include the tens of millions in subsidies and tax breaks that coastal Chinese cities and provinces provide to support local fishing companies.",
		"11" : "According to one study by Greenpeace, subsidies for some Chinese fishing companies amount to a significant portion of their income. For one large state-owned company, CNFC Overseas Fisheries, the $12 million diesel subsidy it received last year made the difference between profit and loss, according to a corporate filing.",
		"12" : "“Chinese fleets are all over the world now, and without these subsidies, the industry just wouldn’t be sustainable,” said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. “For Senegal and other countries of West Africa, the impact has been devastating.”",
		"13" : "In Senegal, an impoverished nation of 14 million, fishing stocks are plummeting. Local fishermen working out of hand-hewn canoes compete with megatrawlers whose mile-long nets sweep up virtually every living thing. Most of the fish they catch is sent abroad, with a lot ending up as fishmeal fodder for chicken and pigs in the United States and Europe.",
		"14" : "The sea’s diminishing returns mean plummeting incomes for fishermen and higher food prices for Senegalese citizens, most of whom depend on fish as their primary source of protein.",
		"15" : "“We are facing an unprecedented crisis,” said Alassane Samba, a former director of Senegal’s oceanic research institute. “If things keep going the way they are, people will have to eat jellyfish to survive.”",
		"16" : "When it comes to global fishing operations, China is the indisputable king of the sea. It is the world’s biggest seafood exporter, and its population accounts for more than a third of all fish consumption worldwide, a figure growing by 6 percent a year.",
		"17" : "The nation’s fishing industry employs more than 14 million people, up from five million in 1979, with 30 million others relying on fish for their livelihood.",
		"18" : "“The truth is, traditional fishing grounds in Chinese waters exist in name only,” said Mr. Zhang of Nanyang University. “For China’s leaders, ensuring a steady supply of aquatic products is not just about good economics but social stability and political legitimacy.”",
		"19" : "But as they press toward other countries, Chinese fishermen have become entangled in a growing number of maritime disputes.",
		"20" : "Indonesia has impounded scores of Chinese boats caught poaching in its waters, and in March last year, the Argentine authorities sank a Chinese vessel that tried to ram a coast guard boat. Violent clashes between Chinese fishermen and the South Korean authorities have left a half-dozen people dead.",
		"21" : "For Beijing, the nation’s fleet of fishing vessels has helped assert its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. In Hainan Province, the government encourages boat owners to fish in and around the Spratlys, the archipelago claimed by the Philippines, and the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam considers its own.",
		"22" : "This maritime militia receives subsidized fuel, ice and navigational devices. Backed by the firepower of Chinese naval frigates, they have driven away thousands of Filipino fishermen who depended on the rich waters around the Spratly Islands.",
		"23" : "Across the Philippine province of Palawan, the impact is reflected in the rows of idled outriggers and the clouds of smoke drifting across freshly denuded hillsides.",
		"24" : "Unable to live off the sea, desperate fishermen have been burning protected coastal jungle to make way for rice fields. But heavy rain often washes away the topsoil, environmentalists say, rendering the steep land useless.",
		"25" : "“Young boys spend their lives preparing to become fishermen,” said Eddie Agamos Brock, who runs Tao, an ecotourism initiative. “Now they have no way to make a living from the sea.”",
		"26" : "For Senegal, which stretches along the Atlantic for more than 300 miles, the ocean is the economic lifeblood and a part of the national identity. Seafood is the main export, and fishing-related industries employ nearly 20 percent of the work force, according to the World Bank.",
		"27" : "Ceebu jen, a hearty fish stew, is the national dish, and sawfish — once plentiful but now rare — grace bank notes. No Senegalese postcard is complete without an image of pirogues, the exuberantly painted boats fishermen use.",
		"28" : "Despite declining fish stocks, unrelenting drought linked to climate change has driven millions of rural Senegalese to the coast, increasing the nation’s dependence on the sea.",
		"29" : "With two-thirds of the population under 18, the strain has helped fuel the surge of young Senegalese trying to reach Europe.",
		"30" : "“Foreigners complain about Africa migrants coming to their countries, but they have no problem coming to our waters and stealing all our fish,” said Moustapha Balde, 22, whose teenage cousin drowned after his boat sank in the Mediterranean.",
		"31" : "The migration to the coast has transformed this seaside city, Joal, from a palm-shaded fishing village into a town of 55,000. Abdou Karim Sall, 50, president of the local fishermen’s association, said there were now 4,900 pirogues in Joal, up from a few dozen when he was a teenager.",
		"32" : "“We always thought that sea life was boundless,” he said while patrolling the coastline. Now, he added, “we are facing a catastrophe.”",
		"33" : "Mr. Sall became a local hero after he single-handedly detained the captains of two Chinese boats that were fishing illegally. These days, residents curse him under their breath because he has expanded his campaign against overfishing to include Senegalese boats that flout fishing rules designed to help stocks rebound.",
		"34" : "“I understand why they hate me,” he said. “They are just trying to survive from day to day.”",
		"35" : "Still, most of his ire is directed at the capacious foreign-owned trawlers. These days, more than 100 large boats work Senegalese waters, a mix of European, Asian and locally flagged vessels, according to government figures. That number doesn’t include boats that fly Senegalese flags but are owned by Chinese companies.",
		"36" : "Also uncounted are the ships that fish illegally, often at night or on the fringes of Senegal’s 200-mile-wide exclusive economic zone — well out of reach of the country’s small navy.",
		"37" : "Dyhia Belhabib, a fisheries expert trying to quantify illegal fishing along the African coast, said Chinese boats were among the worst offenders; in West Africa, they report just 8 percent of their catch, compared with 29 percent for European-flagged vessels, she said.",
		"38" : "According to her estimates, Chinese boats steal 40,000 tons of fish a year from Senegalese waters, an amount worth roughly $28 million.",
		"39" : "Her figures do not include boats engaged in illegal fishing that were never caught — nearly two-thirds of all Chinese vessels, she said. “When darkness falls, the dynamics of illegal fishing change dramatically and it becomes a free-for-all.”",
		"40" : "The problem is magnified across the western Atlantic. Some countries, like Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone, have just a handful of boats to police their national waters.",
		"41" : ".",
		"42" : "In Senegal, recent legislation has drastically increased fines for illegal fishing to $1 million, and officials pointed to the two impounded foreign-owned boats in Dakar, the nation’s capital, as proof that their efforts are bearing fruit.",
		"43" : "Glancing out at the sea, Capt. Mamadou Ndiaye described the challenges he faces as the director of enforcement for Senegal’s Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Economy. Many scofflaws, he noted, fish on the edge of Senegal’s territorial waters and can easily escape when threatened.",
		"44" : "His agency cannot afford speedboats or satellite imagery; it could also use a functioning airplane. “Still, we have more than many other countries, and we have to help them, too,” he said.",
		"45" : "Most of the small pelagic fish that swim in Senegalese waters — and make up 85 percent of the nation’s protein consumption — migrate in enormous schools between Morocco and Sierra Leone. Along the way, they are scooped up by hundreds of industrial trawlers, at least half of them Chinese-owned, experts say.",
		"46" : "In 2012, Senegal stopped granting licenses to foreign trawlers for these small fish, but neighboring countries have refused to follow suit. Mauritania, where most of the fleet is Chinese-Mauritanian joint ventures, is home to 20 fishmeal factories that grind sea life into exported animal feed, with another 20 planned, according to Greenpeace.",
		"47" : "Protecting the seas sometimes means saying no to China, whose largess is funding infrastructure  across Africa.",
		"48" : "“It’s hard to say no to China when they are building your roads,” said Dr. Samba, the former head of Senegal’s oceanic research institute.",
		"49" : "Then there is the lack of transparency that keeps national fishing agreements with China secret.",
		"50" : "“There is corruption in opacity,” said Rashid Sumaila, director of the Fisheries Economics Research Unit at the University of British Columbia Fisheries Center. “Sometimes the Chinese pay bribes to get access and that money doesn’t trickle down, so the population is hit by a double whammy.”",
		"51" : "Beijing has become sensitive to accusations that its huge fishing fleet is helping push fish stocks to the brink of collapse.",
		"52" : "The government says it is aggressively reducing fuel subsidies — by 2019 they will have been cut by 60 percent, according to a fishery official — and pending legislation would require all distant-water vessels manufactured in China to register with the government, enabling better monitoring.",
		"53" : "“The era of fishing any way you want, wherever you want, has passed,” Liu Xinzhong, deputy general director of the Bureau of Fisheries in Beijing, said. “We now need to fish by the rules.”",
		"54" : "But criticism of China’s fishing practices, he added, is sometimes exaggerated, arguing that Chinese vessels traveling to Africa were simply responding to the demand for seafood from developed countries, which have been reducing their own fleets.",
		"55" : "“People come to me and ask, ‘If China doesn’t fish, where would Americans get their fish to eat?’” he said.",
		"56" : "Here in Joal, the dwindling catches have prompted the closing of three of the town’s ice factories, with the fourth barely holding on. On the town’s main quay, where women wade into the surf to meet arriving pirogues, the competition for fish has become intense.",
		"57" : "“We used to have big grouper and tuna, but now we are fighting over a few sardinella,” said one buyer, Sénte Camara, 68. On a good day, she makes $20; on a bad day, she loses money. “The future is dark,” she said.",
		"58" : "To catch anything, fishermen have to venture out farther, putting their lives at risk if an engine stalls or a late summer storm barrels through. Sometimes the danger is a super trawler whose wake can easily swamp a pirogue.",
		"59" : "At Joal’s vast outdoor smoking center, the lack of fish was apparent in the empty racks normally stacked with yellow-tailed sardinella and millet stalks smoldering below.",
		"60" : "Daba Mbaye, 49, one of the few people working, said the smokers could no longer compete with the fishmeal factories.",
		"61" : "“They leave us with nothing, and we are powerless to stop them,” Ms. Mbaye said. “Now we are forced to catch juvenile fish, which is like going into a house and killing all the children. If you do that, the family will eventually disappear.”"

		"3" : "For one thing, it’s naked. Not that most other animals wear clothes, but quite a few have noticeable hair or fur. The mole rat is, you might say, pinkly, wrinkly.",
		"4" : "They are coldblooded, which seems wrong. No other known mammal is.",
		"5" : "They live in underground tunnel complexes in colonies of hundreds led by a queen with a few male consorts, and lots of workers and soldiers. Doesn’t sound like a lion or a lamb, or even a platypus.",
		"6" : "Until recently scientists thought they never got cancer. Then two mole rats in a lab were found to have it. Still, there are a lot of mole rats in the world and only two known to have cancer.",
		"7" : "And now the latest twist in the can-you-believe-what-naked-mole-rats-do story is that the animals can survive for 18 minutes with no oxygen. None.",
		"8" : "They can live for at least five hours in an atmosphere that is only 5 percent oxygen (the normal level is about 20 percent). Mice last about a minute with no oxygen and about 15 minutes in 5 percent oxygen.",
		"9" : "Thomas Park at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said that five hours was an arbitrary cutoff, and that he didn’t know how long they might go. He does know that with no oxygen, 30 minutes was too long. They did not recover.",
		"10" : "Dr. Park, who has studied the animals since 1999, worked with an international team of scientists to uncover this mole rat secret. He and Jane Reznick and Gary R. Lewin at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin and other researchers in the United States, Europe and Africa, reported their findings in Science on Thursday.",
		"11" : "The researchers used a variety of tests on the mole rats’ brains and other organs to determine what was going on with the animals’ physiology.",
		"12" : "Mole rats are a bit like hybrid cars in that they switch one form of energy metabolism for another. Generally, they can run their cells on glucose, the usual way of mice, humans and all other mammals. That process requires oxygen, which is the whole point of breathing.",
		"13" : "But mole rats can switch to a different kind of biochemical process that uses fructose — the sugar found in fruit and high fructose corn syrup — and that doesn’t need oxygen at all.",
		"14" : "They don’t keep running at the same speed when they switch systems. They fall into a kind of suspended animation, with a much lower heart rate and breathing. But they keep going.",
		"15" : "Other mammals, like people and mice, can metabolize fructose without oxygen, but only in a very limited way — in the intestine, for instance. Mole rats, however, have mechanisms and enzymes for emergency fructose use in all their organs, most importantly the brain and heart.",
		"16" : "Mole rats probably evolved this ability because the tunnels they live in can be low in oxygen. In fact, when they all gather together to sleep, the ones in the center may run short on oxygen. It’s harder for them to wake up.",
		"17" : "There’s no immediate use for this knowledge, but it is one of many aspects of mole rat biology that seem worth learning more about. Heart attacks and strokes cause damage when hearts and brains are deprived of oxygen. Since humans do have a similar ability in some tissues to metabolize fructose without oxygen, Dr. Park said, “in theory we could bring that online when need be.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "My mother was what we would now call math anxious, if not phobic. My daughter, on the other hand, was a math major, which always left me feeling like the transitional generation, capable of mastering standardized-test math problems and surviving college calculus (it’s one of the pre-med requirements) but never really connecting to the beauty or power of the subject.",
		"2" : "So when I hear people talk about lack of self-confidence when it comes to numbers or intense math anxiety, I always think first of my mother, a college English professor who was terrified by the idea of calculating a 10 percent tip, and desperately grateful to leave it to any grandchild at the fourth grade level or beyond. (Little did my Depression-era mother know that I had taught her grandchildren to jack up the tips to 15 percent; it would never have occurred to her that anyone would willingly undergo both a slightly more difficult arithmetic problem and a slightly higher cost.)",
		"3" : "New research shows that math anxiety is by no means an American problem, and is found in countries where students regularly outperform us in math skills. In a study published in February, researchers from the University of Chicago looked at data from 64 countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment, which tests 15-year-olds in math, science and reading skills.",
		"4" : "“Math anxiety is prevalent all around the world,” said Julianne Herts, a study author and a doctoral student at the University of Chicago who works in cognitive psychology. “If you look within Japan, students in Japan who are math anxious aren’t scoring as well at math,” she said. “If you look between countries, countries where more students experience math anxiety tend to underperform.”",
		"5" : "So does being “bad at math,” whatever that is, make you anxious, or does being anxious make you bad at math?",
		"6" : "“There’s increasing reason to believe it’s a bidirectional relation,” said Alana Foley, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago in developmental psychology, who was the first author of the study. “Poor performance in math can lead to math anxiety, but there are also studies that point in the other direction; if you have math anxiety it disrupts your concentration.”",
		"7" : "Even students who score high on math tests can feel a special worry around this subject, Dr. Foley said. Among high-performing students, she said, “math anxiety takes a bigger bite out of their performance.”",
		"8" : "Other researchers involved in the study traced math anxiety back further into early childhood. Sian Beilock, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and the author of the book “Choke,” about performance and pressure, said that math anxiety “oftentimes relates most strongly to the performance of those kids who want to do well, who tend to be high achieving in school.”",
		"9" : "A couple of years ago, Dr. Beilock and her colleagues published an article showing that parental math anxiety could be transmitted to children (you can take a test based on the assessment they used, to look at your own level of math anxiety). “The moral of the story is that parents likely play an important role, either for the positive or the negative,” she said.",
		"10" : "There has been some overlap demonstrated between math anxiety and other more general types of anxiety, especially related to test-taking, but math anxiety seems to exist as a separate phenomenon; studies have shown increased heart rates when people were tested on math, but not on other subjects.",
		"11" : "One problem is that we tend to believe with math that you either have the ability or you don’t, rather than assuming that your skills and abilities are the result of study and practice. “It’s an interesting phenomenon in our culture to hear highly intelligent people bragging about not being good at math, not being numbers people,” Dr. Beilock said.",
		"12" : "Dr. Susan Levine, chairwoman of the department of psychology at the University of Chicago, agreed: “An educated person doesn’t go around saying, I’m not a reading person.”",
		"13" : "Researchers believe that the skills — and the anxiety — are actually shaped even before children start formally learning math.",
		"14" : "Dr. Levine said, “a lot of my work starts in the preschool years with the thesis that math learning begins at home.” Math skills at kindergarten entry, she said, predict not only later math achievement but also other important skills, including reading. “There’s some research out there that shows that when kids enter the kindergarten door behind in math, it’s hard to close the gap,” she said.",
		"15" : "So what are those crucial math skills in early childhood? Dr. Levine said that although many preschool children know how to count, they don’t necessarily understand the meaning of the number words. By the time children are around 2, “They can recite the count list up to maybe 10,” she said, but “they don’t understand that the last number you reach is the set size; they don’t connect the counting” to the total. With children from 2½ to 4, “parents are often shocked when we bring kids into the lab,” she said. “They know the kids can count, but when we ask them to give me two of something they just grab a bunch of things.”",
		"16" : "By kindergarten, children have additional skills; for example, they can understand that you can make five by holding up three fingers on one hand and two on the other, or four and one. Dr. Levine said they also can demonstrate what is known as flexible counting — that is, they can start from four or five, without going all the way back to one, or count backward.",
		"17" : "“Parents embrace as part of their responsibility to get kids ready to read in school to introduce them to the alphabet and letter sounds,” Dr. Levine said. “They’re much more likely to think it’s the school’s job to teach math.”",
		"18" : "Whether we realize it or not, the researchers say, those of us who get worried around math probably are less likely to talk about numbers and number concepts to our children. In a 2015 study, parents used a program called “Bedtime Math,” a mobile app that presented short numerical story problems to their children; the children’s math skills improved relative to children in a control group, Dr. Beilock said, but the improvement was strongest in children whose parents had math anxiety.",
		"19" : "Working with the app might help dispel the myth that there are math people and non-math people, said Dr. Levine, and make parents less anxious and more willing to introduce math talk into their daily lives (let’s put five raisins in each cookie; let’s set the table, how many forks do we need?).",
		"20" : "“Think of math as something that’s the purview of the home, not just the school,” Dr. Beilock said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "A few years ago, the folk singer Tom Rush released an album that included some disparaging comments about the Chinese crested dog.",
		"2" : "This wasn’t all that surprising, since these dogs are “little fluffy white guys” as Mr. Rush described his wife’s pets, the kind he was embarrassed to be seen with in the big-dog town of Moose, Wyo., where he lived. To escape notice, he walked them at night on long retractable leashes, an exercise he described as “Trolling for Owls,” the title of his album.",
		"3" : "He may now find the gumption to walk them during the day, in Moose or anywhere else in the country. The breed has a newly discovered heritage: Scientists reported Tuesday that the Chinese crested dog is one of a handful of breeds that trace part of their ancestry to the first dogs to populate the Americas 10,000 or more years ago.",
		"4" : "Heidi G. Parker and Elaine A. Ostrander and their colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, made the discovery in a large study of 1,346 dogs in 161 breeds that they conducted using some existing genomic information and by gathering DNA samples from people’s pets at dog shows and other events. They published the results in Cell Reports.",
		"5" : "The research team was interested in both the general question of how dogs are related to each other and aiding the search for disease genes. Dr. Ostrander’s lab also works on human cancers, and dogs can provide genetic clues. The new paper does not focus on disease genes, however.",
		"6" : "“We wanted to create a data set that would be a great reference,” Dr. Ostrander said.",
		"7" : "Dogs were domesticated 15,000 or more years ago, scientists now think, perhaps in Asia or Europe or in both places independently. The fossil evidence indicates they accompanied the first people who migrated from Asia to America more than 10,000 years ago. But those dogs seem to have disappeared when Europeans brought their own Old World dogs over. Traces of ancient dogs in modern breeds have been glimpsed, but this study looks in depth at DNA from many individual dogs — 170,000 points in the dog genome — to find which breeds share large amounts of genetic material.",
		"8" : "Greger Larson at Oxford University, a specialist in ancient DNA who studies the first appearance of dogs from ancestral wolves, said that there has been a big focus on the early stages of domestication. “What’s great about this study,” he said, is that it brings whole genomes to bear “on breed development,” which is something that appears to date back only 200 years. Before that, it seems there were types of dogs, like herders or guard dogs, but during the Victorian era, dog breeding became so mixed up that it is hard to trace breed ancestry back any further.",
		"9" : "The new research confirms much historical evidence about breed creation and has some intriguing new findings, like the list of breeds that show the heritage of ancient New World dogs. The researchers found several breeds that shared large chunks of DNA not found in other breeds: the Chihuahua, Chinese crested dog, rat terrier, toy fox terrier, American hairless terrier, Mexican hairless (or Xoloitzcuintli) and Peruvian hairless. They concluded that the DNA most likely comes from ancient American dogs.",
		"10" : "The Chinese crested dog, despite its name, seems not to have come from Asia at all. And the toy fox terrier is a lot closer to the rat terrier than to fox terriers. These terriers and the American hairless terrier seemed to be descended from what were called “feists,” dogs that were common in the southern United States and may have been a mix of European hounds and Native American dogs.",
		"11" : "Among other discoveries, Dr. Parker said they found that some behaviors, like herding, were developed more than once. It seems that long before individual breeds were created, herding dogs were bred independently in Britain, Northern Europe and Southern Europe.",
		"12" : "The study shows how recent human movements affected dog breeds. For instance, traces of German shepherd were found unexpectedly in the Mexican hairless and Peruvian hairless, evidence that the dogs of the first Europeans in the Americas got around.",
		"13" : "As for Mr. Rush’s dogs, they were not plain old Chinese crested dogs. As he pointed out, they were “powder puff apricot teacup” Chinese cresteds.",
		"14" : "So he may decide he wants to stay on the night shift after all."

		"1" : "In her 30s, Sophie Marat, now 42, used to record herself reading poetry aloud, then play it back to hear if she sounded like a woman. Ms. Marat, who is transgender, had spent years trying to remake her voice in private by speaking in a higher pitch but ultimately felt that her efforts were hopeless.",
		"2" : "“I was feeling like changing my voice to match my gender identity was almost impossible,” she said. “It was terrible.”",
		"3" : "Ms. Marat’s transition from male to female has been a gradual evolution. She had come out to friends and family back home in Mexico, then began to wear skirts to work as a software engineer in Manhattan. Still, her confidence would falter with everyday tasks like ordering takeout. “It was really painful to speak on the phone,” she said, “because they would reply, ‘O.K., sir.’”",
		"4" : "That was before she started her weekly sessions with a voice therapist at New York University’s speech-language-hearing clinic, one of a growing number of programs that cater to transgender clients seeking to retrain their voices.",
		"5" : "Just as some transgender women and men choose to take hormones or have surgery, or choose neither, some seek to feminize or masculinize their voices. Many say they want a voice that matches their appearance or that the change allows them to escape unwanted attention. There’s also a growing recognition among health professionals who have transgender patients that altering one’s voice can improve quality of life and reduce distress.",
		"6" : "“This isn’t just a sidebar,” said Sandy Hirsch, a Seattle-based speech language pathologist who was a co-author of the pioneering textbook on transgender voice and communication therapy. “It’s an integral part of care for transgender people as they transition.”",
		"7" : "Transgender men who take testosterone permanently thicken their vocal folds, which tends to deepen the pitch of their voice. But transgender women who take hormones — a mix of estrogen and androgen-reducing drugs, for example — typically hear no change in their voices. As a result, transgender women are more likely to work with voice therapists, though transgender men can benefit as well, as some struggle with pitch instability and voice fatigue.",
		"8" : "A lot of what transgender women learn in voice therapy is how to safely use their vocal anatomy to create a higher pitch and oral resonance without straining, so their new voices are ultimately sustainable. “We’re asking them to do an Olympic athletic feat,” said Heather Krug, who has worked with transgender clients for four years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. “If they are going to get pitch into a feminine range, they need to have nicely conditioned vocal cords so they don’t get injuries.”",
		"9" : "Feminizing a voice, however, involves far more than just achieving a consistently higher pitch. Perhaps the most critical, experts say, is a quality called “forward resonance,” in which a speaker feels vibrations closer to the front of the vocal tract, toward the nose and lips.",
		"10" : "Research has shown that “a higher pitch and more forward oral resonance corresponds to a voice consistently perceived as female,” said Adrienne B. Hancock, an associate professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at George Washington University.",
		"11" : "Unlike pitch, which can be readily measured using phone apps, such as Pitch Perfect, resonance can’t be objectively pinpointed. “You need a human ear,” and the speaker has to learn to feel the difference, Dr. Hancock said.",
		"12" : "While do-it-yourself YouTube videos from transgender women are available, sessions with a voice specialist can improve forward resonance and soften an elevated pitch, so someone doesn’t sound like Minnie Mouse, Dr. Hancock said.",
		"13" : "Another voice quality to consider is intonation. While men tend to speak in a monotone fashion, women generally have more highs and lows, something Ms. Marat mastered during about a year of group and one-on-one lessons and practice at N.Y.U.",
		"14" : "Her fundamental pitch is consistently elevated in the feminine range at about 185 hertz, up from 147 hertz. Still, if Ms. Marat speaks for too long, she gets out of breath, and she feels she speaks too softly.",
		"15" : "On Tuesdays, Ms. Marat works with Sam Jaffe, a graduate student at N.Y.U., to get her vocal cords into better shape so she can raise her pitch and volume to where she wants it without becoming breathless. “Voice modification therapy is kind of analogous to going to the gym for your voice,” Mr. Jaffe explained.",
		"16" : "But while therapists help clients gain technical skill, it’s up to each patient to “own” his or her new voice and figure out what sounds right for them, said Leah Helou, the director of the transgender voice program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.",
		"17" : "“It’s not my job to make someone into an image of a lady as I see fit,” Dr. Helou said. “The danger when they come to me is they think, ‘She’s going to tell me what I need to do to pass.’”",
		"18" : "Speech and language therapists have been working with transgender clients as far back as the ’70s, but it wasn’t until 2006 that the first textbook was published. In the past decade, the number of speech pathologists and voice clinicians learning to work with transgender clients has grown exponentially.",
		"19" : "This April, Ms. Hirsch, Dr. Helou and Christie Block, a speech language pathologist in Manhattan, joined forces to expand a two-day training program for voice therapists interested in transgender work. The weekend workshop, which started in 2007 with 25 voice therapists, has grown to roughly 85 clinicians this year, Ms. Hirsch said, with roughly half participating via webinar.",
		"20" : "A Facebook group for speech language therapists and other professionals to discuss transgender care now has about 100 clinicians in the referral database from the United States and about 50 more from abroad, according to Dr. Helou, one of the moderators. Roughly 60 began working with transgender clients only in the last five years.",
		"21" : "Speech language pathologists are also seeing a growing number of transgender people in their 20s and 30s, and even adolescents.",
		"22" : "In 2012, when Cynthia Simonetti, a speech language pathologist, became an instructor at the University of New Mexico, most patients were older, many on the verge of retirement from their jobs. “They were at a point in their lives where they just felt they needed to be true to themselves,” she said. But now, she’s as apt to see new college graduates.",
		"23" : "Since 2015, Northwestern University and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago have held a coed voice training session exclusively for transgender adolescents and young adults.",
		"24" : "Posters advertising the group on campus proclaim, “Be heard for who you are!” The age cutoff is 24, and so far, the youngest participant was 12, said Nathan Waller, a group supervisor and a clinical instructor in Northwestern’s department of communication sciences and disorders. For most, “they are the only trans kid in their school,” he said, so “we make it casual and provide information and practice.”",
		"25" : "Voice modification can take six to 12 months or longer, with home practice required to achieve the stamina needed for sustaining a new voice throughout a tête-à-tête conversation or a work presentation.",
		"26" : "Darlene Monda, the clinic supervisor who started the N.Y.U. group three years ago, said some participants haven’t told their friends they’re transgender yet or started the process of physical transition. But “they want to start working on their voice, so when the time comes, they are ready to transition and have this piece underway,” she said.",

		"1" : "An inexpensive generic drug that saves the lives of wounded soldiers and civilian car crash victims has now been shown to rescue women suffering hemorrhages in childbirth.",
		"2" : "Postpartum hemorrhage, in which women bleed uncontrollably after childbirth, kills an estimated 100,000 women a year in poor and middle-income countries. The complication also forces doctors to perform emergency hysterectomies, especially when hospitals have too little blood on hand to provide transfusions.",
		"3" : "In a major six-year trial involving over 20,000 women in 21 countries, researchers showed that tranexamic acid, a little-known blood-clotter invented in the 1950s, reduced maternal bleeding deaths by a third if it was given within three hours. It costs less than $2 a dose and does not require refrigeration.",
		"4" : "The trial — known as Woman, short for World Maternal Antifibrinolytic — was led by doctors at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and paid for by the Wellcome Trust, Pfizer, Britain’s health department and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Results were published in The Lancet on Wednesday.",
		"5" : "“Tranexamic acid can save women’s lives and ensure more children grow up with a mother,” said Haleema Shakur, one of the lead authors.",
		"6" : "The World Health Organization currently recommends treating birth hemorrhages by massaging the uterus and injecting uterus-shrinking drugs like oxytocin.",
		"7" : "Tranexamic acid acts in a different way — it allows blood to clot more quickly — and so it should be given in addition to the usual measures and at the same time, said Dr. Ian Roberts, one of the study’s lead authors.",
		"8" : "“Women die very quickly from this, especially in Africa, because they are so profoundly anemic,” Dr. Roberts said. “Half the women giving birth there start off with roughly half the red blood cells they should have. If you or I had hemoglobin counts that low, we’d be breathless.”",
		"9" : "“Doctors are forced to throw in everything they’ve got, because they know the woman can be dead in an hour,” he added.",
		"10" : "Emergency hysterectomies save some lives, but the women will never bear another child. It is “logical to infer” that such operations would also be reduced if tranexamic acid becomes widely available in delivery rooms, Dr. Roberts said.",
		"11" : "The drug was invented in Japan by a husband-wife research team, Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. They hoped it would be used to prevent birth hemorrhages, but local obstetricians declined to organize a clinical trial.",
		"12" : "Ultimately, they turned the patent over to a Japanese pharmaceutical company, which sold it as treatment for heavy menstrual periods and as an ingredient in skin-whitening creams. Some oral surgeons used it when doing dental work on hemophiliacs, Dr. Roberts said.",
		"13" : "(Released with the new study was a video interview Dr. Roberts conducted with 98-year-old Utako Okamoto just before her death last year.)",
		"14" : "Suspecting that tranexamic acid could also stop major bleeding like that caused by car crashes or bullet wounds, he eventually received British government funding to do a trial in 20,000 emergency-room patients in 40 countries.",
		"15" : "The results, published in the Lancet in 2010, showed that the drug lowered hemorrhage death rates by 30 percent.",
		"16" : "The British military was so impressed that it started stocking tranexamic acid in surgical units in Iraq, and American military surgeons followed suit. The W.H.O. added it to a list of essential drugs that all hospitals should have on hand.",
		"17" : "Nonetheless, civilian trauma surgeons were slow to adopt tranexamic acid, in part, Dr. Roberts said, because no major drug company conducted a publicity campaign for it. So he did his own, including a movie of a claymation figure bleeding to death and a manga cartoon book about an emergency-room doctor stabbed at work.",
		"18" : "Now, he said, he will focus on seeing whether the drug, which is given intravenously, can be delivered more easily in rural clinics through intramuscular shot or even a pill under the tongue.",
		"19" : "Dr. Jerker Liljestrand, a maternal health specialist at the Gates Foundation, said the organization will work with the W.H.O. and local governments to make sure tranexamic acid becomes part of the recommended treatment for post-partum bleeding."

		"1" : "PISGAH NATIONAL FOREST, N.C. — Here’s what I was told: Get away from the city, go during a new moon and keep my flashlight off. When the sky faded black enough to spot stars twinkling, I’d be able to see mushrooms glowing.",
		"2" : "There are about 100,000 species of fungi, but only about 80 of them bioluminesce, or glow in the dark. They pop up in tropical and temperate forests in the Americas, Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa.",
		"3" : "They emit green light, a result of nearly the same chemical reaction that illuminates the belly of a firefly or the skin of a squid, only the resulting light is constant in the mushroom, not on-demand or reactive as in some insects or marine animals. The molecules responsible for the colors are different too. And in a study published on Wednesday in Science Advances, researchers have finally revealed what’s going on inside these flamboyant fungi — at a molecular scale.",
		"4" : "With mushroom season approaching, you can see them glowing, too, and you don’t even need to leave the country. But you’ll need to practice patience and prepare for disappointment when heading out on the hunt. In a boggy forest near Asheville, N.C., I once spent a night two summers ago tracking down three species of glowing mushrooms. Lost in the dark with a dying phone and a forager known locally as the Mushroom Man, I learned that mushrooms are unpredictable.",
		"5" : "“You can’t always get what you want, when you want it,” said Alan Muskat, who leads quirky foraging tours with his company, No Taste Like Home, near Asheville. “This isn’t like a convenience store.”",
		"6" : "I learned a few other lessons as well.",
		"7" : "In all bioluminescent organisms, a small molecule called luciferin interacts with oxygen and a bigger protein called luciferase, creating chemical energy that is eventually released in the form of cold light. Every organism has its own version of luciferin and luciferase, with individual properties that could prove useful.",
		"8" : "For example, one group has unsuccessfully tried to make glowing plants by splicing in genes from bioluminescent bacteria. But the chemicals involved in fungal bioluminescence may be more compatible with plants.",
		"9" : "“Maybe it will be as difficult as people traveling to Mars or other galaxies, but maybe we will use it,” said Zinaida Kaskova, a chemist at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University in Moscow who led the study of bioluminescent mushroom molecules.",
		"10" : "Unlike other bioluminescent organisms, fungi emit a constant light, possibly to attract spore-transporting insects, that dims and intensifies according to a circadian clock that still isn’t quite understood.",
		"11" : "On the Japanese island Hachijo-jima, tiny, common mushrooms — known locally as hato-no-hi, or pigeon fire — glow along forest paths during the rainy season from May through September. And in the Atlantic forest of southern Brazil, Neonthopanus gardneri, or flor de coco, resembles a large, radioactive flower from another planet.",
		"12" : "But among the thousands of fungi that grow in the subsection of the southern Appalachian Mountains I was exploring, there are a few glowers. The large, orange fruiting bodies of Omphalotus olearius, or jack-o’-lantern, appear in great numbers around June through September.",
		"13" : "Then there’s Panellus stipticus, or bitter oyster, a summer mushroom that looks like a tiny, tan fan growing on sticks. You can also find Armillaria mellea, a sometimes-parasitic fungus also known as honey mushroom that appears in the fall and makes wood look as if it’s glowing.",
		"14" : "But first, you have to find them.",
		"15" : "Don’t go into the woods alone at night. Find a guide in a local mushroom hunting group. A good place to start is the North American Mycological Association, an organization of professional and amateur mycologists.",
		"16" : "My guide, Mr. Muskat, is not a professional mycologist, but he has decades of experience — enough to write a book. His weird sense of humor and Tao-like wisdom made a dragging hunt less taxing. A week before we met, he enlisted “informants” who provided leads on where to find our three mushrooms. These included photos and detailed descriptions of what trail they were on, how far down it they would be found and even the unique characteristics and type of tree they were under.",
		"17" : "But tips don’t always pan out. We spent two hours wandering down a trail searching for honey mushrooms, only to find after we had turned back that the fungus was under the tree we had passed at the trail head.",
		"18" : "Foxfire is the emberlike glow that appears when a honey mushroom’s rootlike filaments infect and start killing a deciduous tree, often an oak. To see whether the fungus we had found would produce a glow, we looked for the dark, stringy infestation known as a rhizomorph, or shoestring rot, because that’s what it looks like, and that’s what it does to the wood.",
		"19" : "Mr. Muskat found a rhizomorph at the bottom of our tree, but the healthy-looking wood and the dead-looking mushroom suggested it wouldn’t glow. Still, he shouted “lights out,” and we waited for even a faint light. As we allowed our eyes to adapt to the darkness — it should take around 20 minutes — we played a brain game called minute mystery to pass the time.",
		"20" : "The honey mushroom we found never produced any glowing wood, but while I sat in the dark, I spotted tiny green dots: an unexpected cluster of bitter oyster, one of the other glowing species, lined up on a small stick.",
		"21" : "More bitter oyster appeared, as if out of nowhere, in another spot where we were disappointed yet again by decomposing jack-o’-lantern mushrooms. The dead mushrooms looked like burned pancakes that were teeming with insects, emitting only a dim, ghostly, pewter aura.",
		"22" : "As a mushroom’s metabolism shuts down in death, so does its ability to create light, said Dr. Kaskova: “Fewer and fewer molecules of luciferin are synthesized, so the glowing becomes weaker and weaker.”",
		"23" : "After an unsatisfying evening, we went looking for other mushrooms just for fun the next day. Unexpectedly, we found hundreds of jack-o’-lanterns in the daylight. This is why you should always bring a basket. It should be wood or natural fiber with a lattice bottom so the mushrooms’ spores can return to the forest floor.",
		"24" : "To collect the mushrooms, bring a knife and a brush. Unless you want your ’shrooms to turn into slime, bring wax paper or a paper bag, never plastic.",
		"25" : "At home, I placed my fresh jack-o’-lanterns, gills up, in a cardboard box in the corner of a windowless bathroom and waited for my eyes to adjust. It didn’t take long before I saw the little glowing gills. They appeared to be breathing. Hello there, my neon green friend. I’ve heard so much about you."

		"2" : "A new study suggests that the material humanity needs to one day construct houses, buildings and even entire colonies on Mars may already exist within the red planet’s own desolate soil. The research is still early and the technology is unlikely to be ready in time to meet President Trump’s stated goal of putting people on Mars by the end of his first term, but it could lay the groundwork for settlement of the planet if further study and testing confirms its findings.",
		"3" : "“If this can indeed be scaled up for mass production on Mars, then I would say we are lucky,” said Yu Qiao, a materials scientist and engineer at the University of California, San Diego, pointing out that soil on the moon does not share that ability. He and his colleagues published their work Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
		"4" : "Dr. Qiao and his colleagues experimented with a substance that is chemically and physically similar to what you might find on the surface of Mars, but is made from particles on our planet. They call it Martian soil simulant. Quite by accident, the team members found that with enough pressure they could mash the mock Martian dirt into bricks — no extraterrestrial kiln needed.",
		"5" : "The technique, if it works with real Martian soil, could make it possible to develop building material on Mars without needing extreme heat, water or a binding agent. Though the bricks they created were small, they were stronger than steel-reinforced concrete, Dr. Qiao said.",
		"6" : "His team had previously worked with an analogue for lunar soil, which needs a binding agent that acts like glue in order to be compressed into a brick. The idea behind that research was that one day astronauts would take the binding agent with them to the moon, mix it with the soil and then compact it into blocks that they could use to make structures.",
		"7" : "After that work, his team set their eyes on Mars. They realized they could produce the same kind of bricks for the red planet with smaller and smaller amounts of their space glue, until they found they could make Martian bricks by using pressure without a bonding agent.",

		"9" : "The team members think that the iron oxide, which gives the soil its red color, acts like a glue to hold the particles together after it is subjected to enough pressure. Dr. Qiao said his next step was to investigate whether the technique could create larger bricks that could potentially build a house.",
		"10" : "“The paper is an interesting step in the right direction of development of building material for future explorers,” said Jon Rask, a research scientist at NASA who was not involved in the study. He said he would like to see this research conducted under extremely cold and dry conditions that mirror Mars’s atmosphere to see if the results would hold up.",
		"11" : "Henning Roedel, a doctoral candidate at Stanford University who studies technology for construction in outer space, said in an email that scaling the method could prove to be a challenge. Still, he called the technique an elegant solution to the problem of building on other planetary bodies.",

		"1" : "Not all Twitter bots are trying to spam, hack or peddle you fake news. Some are works of creativity, programmed to tweet diagrams of imaginary bird migrations or haikus composed of words scavenged from surveys of marine mammals.",
		"2" : "I follow Twitter bots for serendipitous notes that take me out of my day, if just fleetingly. There’s comfort in witnessing a narrative take form outside the direct control of humans and oblivious to the breakneck clip of the internet.",
		"3" : "Science-themed Twitter bots come in various forms, doling out humor, factual information and galactic perspective. There’s @shark_girls, which casts two geotracked great white sharks as travel writers, quoting from the writings of Virginia Woolf and the poet Hilda Doolittle. There’s @the_ephemerides, which juxtaposes raw images taken by outer planet probes like the Cassini spacecraft with computer-generated poems. There are many more. Below are some of my favorites.",
		"4" : "Nicole He programmed this bot to tweet a photo of her fiddle-leaf fig, a common houseplant, at 10:17 every morning. Over time, you can see the plant birth new offshoots and shuffle its leaves ever so slightly.",
		"5" : "“It’s striking how often people tweet encouraging, nice things at the plant about how shiny its leaves are or how fast it’s growing,” wrote Ms. He, a programmer and artist, in an email. “I think I’ve discovered that a humbly tweeting plant is actually the secret to world peace (or at least kindness on Twitter).”",
		"6" : "This bot tweets descriptions of emergency room visits from a government database that tracks about 100 hospitals across the United States.",
		"7" : "Its parent, Keith Collins, a reporter at Quartz, emailed that he didn’t expect to laugh out loud when he first looked at the data. But most of the injuries are minor, he said, and there’s something about the way they’re written in the “pithy style of a rushed E.R. doctor.” Noticing a glut of entries about patients who punched walls, he charted the age distribution of wall-punchers and found that 15-year-olds were most prolific.",

		"11" : "Also dedicated to winged creatures, this bot tweets make-believe moths of all shapes, sizes, textures and iridescent colors. It’s programmed to generate variations in several anatomical structures of real moths, including antennas, wing shapes and wing markings.",
		"12" : "Another program, which splices and recombines real Latin and English moth names, generates monikers for the moths. You can also reply to the account with name suggestions, and it will generate a corresponding moth.",
		"13" : "Inspired by naturalist illustrations, such as those of Ernst Haeckel, the programmers designed their bot to create moths stroke by stroke, with each insect composed of tens of thousands of individual strokes. “At its core, the moth generator is a wildly byzantine drawing machine in the shape of a moth,” said Katie Rose Pipkin, an artist at Carnegie Mellon University who created the bot with Loren Schmidt.",
		"14" : "“They have discovered a planet. A guinea pig-like creature lives there and creeps through the valleys. It is something of a mystery.” Such are the snapshots offered by Newfound Planets, a bot that tweets about fictional distant worlds.",
		"15" : "The human behind it, Charles Bergquist, who directs the public radio program Science Friday, wrote via email that he thinks people enjoy the bot because they yearn to know what it’s like on another planet — “how big it is, might there be water or what might the sunrise look like.”",
		"16" : "This bot also tweets about fictional lands, but based on actual erosion science. Martin O’Leary, a glaciologist at Swansea University in Wales, programmed it as part of National Novel Generation Month, a spinoff of National Novel Writing Month that challenges people to write an algorithm that writes a novel (here’s his accompanying novel).",
		"17" : "The bot starts with a random initial terrain, then simulates how water would flow over it to create channels, valleys and coastlines. Cities are placed away from each other and near running water, and Dr. O’Leary wrote another program to name the cities.",

He said a lot of publicly available information about science amounted to, “Look at this amazing thing right now!” But Twitter bots “worm their way into your life, sit there and slowly give you this drip of stuff. They’re gentle.”"

		"1" : "A quiet little celebration is happening over at the Public Theater, honoring 60 years of its Mobile Unit, which takes Shakespeare to the people with performances in New York City community centers, correctional facilities and shelters, and then at the Public itself. “Twelfth Night,” this spring’s play, has wrapped up its five-borough tour and is now onstage at the mother ship. In honor of the anniversary, all tickets are free.",
		"2" : "It’s a lovely gesture, but a customary ratcheting down of expectations is in order. Directed by Saheem Ali, vaguely set in coastal Florida and sprinkled with Spanish, this frantic staging does offer some amusements — chief among them, David Ryan Smith as a wonderfully prissy Malvolio, and Donnetta Lavinia Grays as a teasing, protean Feste. But it also suffers the fate of many an outreach show produced by institutional theaters, including the Public: It’s not as good as the usual fare.",
		"3" : "That’s not because of the streamlined physical design. The show does fine with unchanging overhead lighting, and the flat square (by Arnulfo Maldonado) that forms the stage is tricksy enough to transform briefly and cleverly into the roiling sea where the twins of the tale, Viola (Danaya Esperanza) and Sebastian (Sebastian Chacon), are separated before washing ashore, each assuming that the other has drowned.",
		"4" : "Disguising herself as a young man named Cesario, Viola gets a job with a duke, Orsino (Michael Bradley Cohen), who is unrequitedly in love with the haughty Olivia (Ceci Fernandez). Adored by her own servant, Malvolio — even the pattern of his baby-blue pajamas, by Dede Ayite, is a tribute to her — Olivia is smitten with Cesario, who is (supposedly) a dead ringer for Sebastian. Mistaken-identity high jinks ensue, as does a practical joke on Malvolio by the clownish Sirs Toby (Christopher Ryan Grant) and Andrew (Mr. Cohen) and their chum Maria (Aneesh Sheth).",
		"5" : "It’s a convoluted and ridiculous plot that demands clarity in performance but mostly doesn’t get it from this erratic production, whose pared-down script (a feature of Mobile Unit shows) adds to the confusion. Mr. Ali’s conceit is that Viola and Sebastian are Cuban refugees, but that doesn’t come across onstage.",
		"6" : "The lively Latin and house music, performed by Ms. Grays and the show’s composer, Michael Thurber, is entertaining, and the slow-growing attraction between Viola and Orsino is sweet. But there is an overwhelming forced merriment in the pursuit of laughs — a layering on of brightly colored wackiness that feels partly like desperation and partly like an attempt to dumb things down, as if by making the comedy broad enough it will be comprehensible by the masses.",
		"7" : "That’s what rankles, despite the Mobile Unit’s laudable mission. As Stephanie Ybarra, the Public’s director of special artistic projects, said in her preshow introduction on Wednesday night, some of the places that this cast has performed “Twelfth Night” are “designed to oppress and kill the human spirit.” It is honorable to bring Shakespeare into those spaces.",
		"8" : "But mere worthiness is unworthy of the Public, which is in the business of making great art for the people of its city — all of them. Why should audiences in shelters and detention centers get less than top-caliber stuff? If it’s a matter of resources, maybe the Mobile Unit should get more. Because surely its target audiences need the solace of Shakespeare at least as much as people who can afford to shell out for the next must-see production in from London or to spend hours in line for a free ticket to Shakespeare in the Park.",
		"9" : "Muddled Shakespeare can leave audiences blaming themselves for failing to get it — can, in fact, turn them off to trying it again. Shakespeare done brilliantly, though, is a revelation. And revelation is what the Public should be helping its Mobile Unit to achieve."

		"2" : "His death was confirmed by his son, N. Thomas Hatch Jr.",
		"3" : "Armed with a .45 caliber pistol, Staff Sergeant Hatch, 22 years old at the time, waded ashore on tiny Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands in November 1943 at the beginning of a 76-hour battle that would claim the lives of an estimated 1,000 Marines and sailors and more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers.",

It showed it up close and dirty.”",

Roosevelt had been reluctant to release gruesome images of dead Marines floating in the waters off Tarawa, but that the journalist Robert Sherrod had convinced him that bringing the grim battle home would rally Americans behind the war.",

		"14" : "Mr. Hatch assigned his colleague Bill Genaust to film the Marines’ flag-raising atop Mount Suribachi. A small flag had been installed, but a larger one was ordered to be placed on the island’s highest point.

		"1" : "The toxic mess of nationalism and anti-Semitism known as the Dreyfus Affair deeply divided France in the late 19th century, but any observer of the National Front’s ideology will know that the scandal’s legacy continues to poison French society.",
		"2" : "A sense of anxiety is established from the beginning of “The Dreyfus Affair,” a hybrid of concert and theater that has become the signature style of the Ensemble for the Romantic Century.",
		"3" : "Gyorgy Ligeti’s creepy “String Quartet No. 2” opens the production. The live music is paired with abstract projections incorporating jumbled typography. (Handwriting played a key role, as Dreyfus was framed for treason in 1894 based on an unsigned letter.)",
		"4" : "As if to tighten a nightmarish vise on our minds, Ligeti’s quartet returns at regular intervals during this show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.",
		"5" : "In other ways, though, the production, written by Eve Wolf, the Ensemble founder, and directed by Donald T. Sanders, is straightforward. Unfairly accused of spying, Capt. Alfred Dreyfus (Max von Essen, “An American in Paris”) was dismissed from the military and shipped off to Devil’s Island. Meanwhile, his wife, Lucie (Meghan Picerno), and brother, Mathieu (Mark Evans), tirelessly fought to clear his name.",
		"6" : "They battled not just the Army, which considered the Jewish captain a convenient scapegoat, but a virulently anti-Semitic press — David Bengali’s projections include chilling period caricatures and slogans like “France for the French” (still heard at National Front rallies).",
		"7" : "The case split families and political parties, and stirred up the press. “What a poignant drama, and what superb characters!” the novelist Émile Zola (Peter Scolari, who played Hannah’s father on “Girls”) enthused before penning the pro-Dreyfus editorial “J’accuse…!,” the opening salvo of the modern engaged intellectual. Zola’s passion provides welcome fire to a show that otherwise hews to a calm, even-keeled tone, exemplified by Mr. von Essen’s sober performance. Much of the emotion comes from the music, which both illustrates and comments on the story, but is not necessarily from the Dreyfus era — a conceptual gambit that can be just as distracting as illuminating.",
		"8" : "Baroque pieces by Jean-Philippe Rameau predate the affair by centuries, and are used in a head-scratching ballet of military officers; Jehan Alain’s pulsating “Litanies,” performed with verve by the organist Parker Ramsay, are from the 1930s, decades after Dreyfus was rehabilitated.",
		"9" : "The point may be to underline the timelessness of the issues. Bracingly, the show reminds us that in 2002, a statue of Dreyfus was defaced in Paris."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "FRANKLIN, Tenn. — At a Chris Stapleton concert, there is incendiary singing, rich celebrations of country music tradition and, most important, the eye thing.",
		"2" : "It happens frequently onstage when that country singer and his wife, Morgane, face each other, not the crowd, and hold each other’s gaze for seconds, sometimes minutes. It is a shocking reframing of live performance. Even though the show is technically Mr. Stapleton’s, with Ms. Stapleton singing backup, and even though there is an audience rapturously watching, often it feels as if the whole room is reduced to wordless, loving conversation between two people.",
		"3" : "“We’re married so we hold each other accountable,” Mr. Stapleton said last month on the family ranch in this unassuming town 30 minutes and several light-years south of Music Row in Nashville. “We can lift each other up on bad nights, kind of give each other a wink when we screw up or do something funny.”",
		"4" : "The dynamic between the two is one of country’s great treats, a vivid display of affection that elevates their music. It also creates a showcase for Ms. Stapleton, who, over a decade ago, was an aspiring country star with a record deal of her own. Her harmonies are some of the most affecting parts of “From A Room: Volume 1,” Mr. Stapleton’s second solo album, which will be released on Friday, two years after “Traveller,” his debut, which went platinum and earned him two Grammys, five Country Music Association awards and the somewhat unexpected role of high-profile vintage country preservationist.",
		"5" : "Like “Traveller,” “From A Room” is earthen, rich with tradition, has a tactile intensity and is carefully measured. It’s full of songs about romantic disappointment and people letting each other down, often with the Stapletons singing in devastating harmony, like on “Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning” and “Up to No Good Livin’.”",
		"6" : "“Traveller” kickstarted Mr. Stapleton’s solo career (after years in bands, and one false solo start) and, as a bonus, revived his wife’s as well.",
		"7" : "The two met in 2003. Both were songwriters who plied their trade in adjacent buildings, and Ms. Stapleton was close friends with the woman responsible for pushing Mr. Stapleton’s songs to singers who might record them. After a few months, he asked if she’d like to write a song together. She proposed Friday at 6 p.m., a time when not much songwriting gets done. Four years later they were married. They have two children, now 6 and 8.",
		"8" : "When they met, Ms. Stapleton was signed to the label Arista Nashville under her maiden name, Morgane Hayes. “I think the label was looking for Gretchen Wilson, the total package — a crazy talented woman, who could write great songs and sing the hell out of them,” Ms. Stapleton said. “I was still trying to find my voice.”",
		"9" : "Though she recorded about three albums’ worth of songs, she never formally released any music. Her Myspace page survives, revealing a tender-voiced singer with sass and a dark streak. (Check out the wry “We Just Talk About It” and the bitter “We Tried.” She sang demos for $60 a pop (until someone told her she could charge $125), and backed up Lee Ann Womack on tour. She had some success as a songwriter, including on Carrie Underwood’s “Don’t Forget to Remember Me,” which went to No .2 on the Billboard country songs chart.",
		"10" : "Though Ms. Stapleton played her own shows occasionally, she hated the spotlight. As a young singer, she performed with her sister, but standing out in front, alone, unnerved her: “I broke out in hives one time — I don’t remember why. I have an aversion to the spotlight. It’s not for everybody.”",
		"11" : "Then, as now, Mr. and Ms. Stapleton shared the stage, though then it was Mr. Stapleton backing her on guitar. “He definitely gave me a boost of ‘you can do this’ — not because he said it, but just because he was standing with me,” she said. But Mr. Stapleton wasn’t seeking the limelight, either. “I think it’s why he’s always got a beard, he’s always got long hair.”",
		"12" : "She asked to be released from her record contract, and for years largely avoided the stage. Before “Traveller,” Ms. Stapleton occasionally joined Mr. Stapleton’s set, but during the tour for that album, her presence became more frequent, and more integral.",
		"13" : "“I don’t remember the moment, but I remember feeling like I can’t miss this anymore,” she said. Now when the Stapletons tour, it is as a family, with Ms. Stapleton’s mother home schooling the children. “When we weren’t taking the kids, I always felt like I couldn’t win,” Ms. Stapleton said. “I was always in the wrong place.”",
		"14" : "Now, the show is incomplete without their interplay, Mr. Stapleton’s lionesque roar against Ms. Stapleton’s rustic balm.",
		"15" : "“I was singing with Chris long before he knew I was singing with him,” she said, remembering how she would ask his publishing representative for “volumes of his songs, CDs of everything he’d ever written up until that point, and I would take them home and study and sing along.”",
		"16" : "And she is a major driving force in Mr. Stapleton’s song selection. “From A Room” is made up of songs written many years ago, drawn from a 1,000-deep catalog. (Part 2 of the album is due this year.)",
		"17" : "“She is such a great litmus,” said Dave Cobb, Mr. Stapleton’s producer. “She has a huge input on what becomes the sound of the record.”",
		"18" : "Ms. Stapleton has recently released one song where she is credited first (alongside her husband): a scintillating, bluesy cover of “You Are My Sunshine,” on a compilation by Mr. Cobb. “They light each other up,” Mr. Cobb said. “He knows that when she walks in the room, he’s got to make it better.”",
		"19" : "The trust runs both ways. “I don’t have to be medicated anymore to get onstage,” she said. “I used to be so afraid that I would have to take beta blockers so I wouldn’t shake.” Though Ms. Stapleton has no specific plans to release more music under her name, “recently we’ve had a few conversations of, ‘Hey, what would that be?’ ” she said. “Just casual conversation, really.”",
		"20" : "If it happens, it will certainly be with Mr. Stapleton at her side, probably with eyes fixed on each other.",
		"21" : "“As much as I can talk about him being a comfort to me, I think in that way I also am a comfort to him,” she said. “We can look at each other and know, ‘O.K., I got you.’”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "NEW ORLEANS — The sound of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is a syncopated beat: rooted in Africa, mingled with elements from Europe and the Americas, transmitted through generations, played by hand and determined to get people dancing. The beat doesn’t have to sell a song; it’s a joy in itself. It’s proudly old-fashioned, celebrating its own history. Yet it lives in the immediate present, the moment when music generates motion.",
		"2" : "Jazz Fest, as everyone calls it, is as stubbornly exceptional and as proudly nostalgic as the city it reflects. First presented in 1970, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival became one template for the modern pop festival, like Coachella or Bonnaroo, with music on multiple stages, assorted nonmusic exhibitions, and food and crafts vendors geared to the crowd.",
		"3" : "But where other major festivals tend to be brief invasions of their locales, Jazz Fest is an institution, inseparable from the city where it also sponsors free events through the year and supports the only-in-New-Orleans public radio station WWOZ. And where other major festivals have current pop hitmakers as their big draws, along with an undercard of new acts striving to reach the main stage in a year or two, Jazz Fest prizes the regional over the national, putting just a few big names in headlining spots.",
		"4" : "Its first weekend this year, which started last Friday, included Lorde, Usher with the Roots, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Elle King, the Trey Anastasio Band, Alabama Shakes and Maroon 5. Its second half, starting on Thursday, has scheduled Stevie Wonder, Dave Matthews, Snoop Dogg and Wilco. Nearly everything else — except, this year, for a contingent of superb bands from Cuba — stays local and familiar, as untrendy as a festival can be. (The festival ends of Sunday.) Onstage during the festival, I saw more sousaphones than laptops.",
		"5" : "The visiting pop headliners attract hometown residents and a youth contingent. Out-of-towners — many grizzled and wearing Hawaiian-style souvenir shirts from previous Jazz Fests — return for an annual immersion in Louisiana lore. That means brass bands and Mardi Gras Indians, who perform on stages and — simulating the city’s continuing street traditions — in miniparades through the fairgrounds where the festival is held. It also means blues, zydeco from bayou country and a Jazz Fest touchstone, the gospel tent, where singers, preachers and choirs of everyday worshipers belt out praises and gratitude.",
		"6" : "Jazz Fest’s New Orleans aesthetic is defined not by the big pop chorus but by live, danceable grooves. New Orleans audiences appreciate instrumental music; Jazz Fest has long been hospitable to jam bands and, this year, to bands like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, whose live sets move toward improvisation. The “heritage” in the festival’s name also looms large. Jazz Fest glorifies genre as much as individual musicianship; New Orleans is full of performers who proudly steep themselves in vintage styles and a shared repertoire, handed down from parent to child and embraced by musicians who move into the city.",
		"7" : "New Orleans honors its ancestors, keeping old songs current and paying tribute in ways that go deeper than borrowing surefire hits, although this year’s Jazz Fest had its share of crowd-pleasing Prince covers. Inevitably, over 48 years Jazz Fest has faced generational change and loss; this year’s lineup included sets devoted to definitive New Orleans figures like the traditional jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain and the songwriter Allen Toussaint.",
		"8" : "Visiting musicians often adapt to Jazz Fest, not the other way around. Nas, the New York rapper, played with the Soul Rebels, a New Orleans brass band, reminding listeners that “these are my roots, too.”",
		"9" : "More subtly, the festival leads listeners to hear musical kinships — particularly, this year, from a Cuban contingent that included Gente de Zona, a reggaetón group that has won a Latin Grammy, and the Septeto Nacional de Ignacio Piñeiro, founded in 1927, playing vintage-style Cuban son. There are longstanding ties between the music of New Orleans and of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba; what Jelly Roll Morton called the “Spanish tinge” was actually the Afro-Cuban rhythms that made their way into New Orleans Mardi Gras music, jazz and R&B.",
		"10" : "Bouncing across the fairgrounds field, mingling with second-line brass-band drums, Mardi Gras Indian chants and the hooting, ratcheting two-steps of zydeco bands (like Dwayne Dopsie and the Zydeco Hellraisers), their syncopations joined the New Orleans mix, sounding right at home.",
		"11" : "Notable acts from the 2017 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival included:",
		"12" : "LORDE Like an emissary from a separate pop planet, Lorde played a headlining set that defied Jazz Fest customs. She had party songs, but they were about feeling isolated; she had beats that she danced to — striding and punching the air — but they were stark and somber. Part of her music, notably backup vocals, was canned. And she brought the same songs from her coming album, “Melodrama,” that she had performed a week earlier at Coachella. But her own singing was impassioned and drew ardent, verse-and-chorus singalongs on songs from her debut album; and she charmed the crowd by singing a snippet from Tom Petty, who was playing on the other main stage, and noting her dangerous attraction to beignets. Three songs into her set, she had noticed the New Orleans difference: “You guys have danced more than the entirety of Coachella,” she said.",
		"13" : "USHER AND THE ROOTS Usher didn’t bring his elaborate arena-concert setup or his electronics-loving band to Jazz Fest. Instead, he collaborated with the Roots, reworking his music with live muscle rather than programming, meshing his own songs with soul oldies and testing himself as an old-school soul man. He easily seduced the densely packed crowd, promising “so many ways to love you” and carrying the crest of his set toward a galloping gospel climax. He also shared time with the Roots, ceding the stage to their rapper, Black Thought, for dense, breakneck rhymes of his own.",
		"14" : "STANTON MOORE The drummer Stanton Moore, who plays constantly around New Orleans, previewed his next album, due in July: a tribute to Allen Toussaint featuring Cyrille Neville on vocals. Mr. Moore is used to stirring up a dance floor; his drumming was steady and unstoppable, pushing toward peaks. With a drummer’s wit, he switched Toussaint’s “Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky” into a 5/4 meter that might trip up dancers, and kept it funky anyway.",
		"15" : "TELMARY Y HABANA SANA The Cuban poet, rapper and songwriter Telmary Diaz didn’t rely on her words alone to get across her socially conscious messages. She had a full Latin band, playing the sinuous rhythms of son and speedy, percussive rumba, surrounding her with melodic refrains.",
		"16" : "TRUMPET MAFIA Ashlin Parker’s Trumpet Mafia already lived up to its name with just three trumpeters onstage, sharing arrangements like a big-band trumpet section and then going round-robin on quicksilver, articulate solos. Then came the big reveal: more trumpeters, at least a dozen, swarmed onstage at the Jazz Tent, from 8 years old on up, and they weren’t just there for backup. Many of them stepped forward for impressive solos.",
		"17" : "MIDNITE DISTURBERS Bruising but precise, Midnite Disturbers is an alliance of musicians from many brass bands, doubling up to play songs they all know — and where a typical brass band has one sousaphone huffing the bass line, the Midnite Disturbers had a pair, huffing in harmony. The group’s uniform was black T-shirts with individual names on the front — not their own names, but, true to New Orleans musical continuity, the names of musicians they respect.",
		"18" : "THE PEDRITO MARTINEZ GROUP Latin pop, propulsive dance vamps and adventurous jazz were all part of the spectrum for the Pedrito Martinez Group, a Cuban band led by Mr. Martinez, a kinetic conga player and a pealing singer, often both at the same time.",
		"19" : "MOKOOMBA This band from Zimbabwe sings in the language its members grew up with, Tonga. But its guitar grooves are a Pan-African blend, drawing on the thumb-pianolike guitar picking of older Zimbabwean pop, on the lilting rumba of Congolese soukous and on hints of rock. It was topped with the chameleonic vocals of Mathias Muzaza, who moved from a smooth croon to rasping, riveting incantations.",
		"20" : "DWAYNE DOPSIE AND THE ZYDECO HELLRAISERS The button accordionist Dwayne Dopsie is the youngest son of Alton Jay Rubin, better known as Rockin’ Dopsie, who died in 1993. (Dwayne’s brother Anthony, who bills himself as Rockin’ Dopsie Jr., performs at Jazz Fest on Saturday.) Dwayne Dopsie carries on the rowdy, muscular family zydeco tradition: singing in English, pumping out thick chords and suddenly breaking into whirlwind solos.",
		"21" : "E’DANA & DIVINELY DESTIN For much of Jazz Fest, New Orleans talent fills the gospel tent (although the Clark Sisters, national gospel hitmakers, had a prime slot on Sunday night). I happened in as E’Dana Richardson was testifying and belting, call-and-responding with rising fervor, over a guitar-scrubbing funk groove delivered by her band and singers. Then she introduced them: her children, nephews and big brother. “This is all family up here!” she exulted."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "In the middle of Handel’s “Ariodante,” the title character makes an uncomfortably convincing case for suicide. On Sunday, the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, singing the role in a concert performance of the opera with the conductor Harry Bicket and his English Concert chamber orchestra, held Carnegie Hall’s audience in thrall for nearly nine minutes as she wrung every bit of emotion from this music.",
		"2" : "In this long aria, “Scherza infida,” Ariodante, a Scottish knight, imagines his beloved, the princess Ginevra, frolicking with his rival, a duke. The slow, halting melody conveys both his longing and his desolation; a curiously lilting bass line for pizzicato strings seems to mock Ariodante with a hint of Ginevra’s fickleness. In a somber middle section, the knight resolves to take his own life and return as a ghost to torment Ginevra. The music has such grief-stricken elegance that for a moment it almost convinces you that this is possible.",
		"3" : "The English Concert’s almost annual visits to Carnegie since 2013 for concert performances of Handel operas and oratorios have been highlights of several seasons. Ms. DiDonato starred in the ensemble’s extraordinary “Alcina” (2014), and the hall was packed for “Ariodante,” one of Handel’s longest operas: The performance lasted close to four hours, with two intermissions. (It was webcast live on medici.tv and is now available for viewing there.)",
		"4" : "On the surface, his operas, following a parade-of-arias structure, may seem stuck in conventions that were becoming dated even in Handel’s day. But at his best, he dug in to tease out every psychological current in his characters. And “Ariodante,” from 1735, is a masterpiece, especially as performed on Sunday by an exceptional cast.",
		"5" : "In just the first few arias, Handel shows us, one by one, who these characters are. “Ariodante” opens as Ginevra (the bright-voiced soprano Christiane Karg) tells her attendant about her love for Ariodante in an effusive arioso. Yet fluttery touches in the music suggest that the princess lacks some grounding. When Polinesso, the preening duke, arrives and declares his love, Ginevra rebuffs him in a feisty aria full of spitfire runs.",
		"6" : "Her gullible attendant, Dalinda (Mary Bevan, a luscious lyric soprano), has fallen for the duke, as she reveals in a demure aria suggesting her vulnerability. Polinesso (like Ariodante, a trouser role, here nailed by the hearty contralto Sonia Prina), sensing opportunity, feigns love for Dalinda in an audaciously manipulative aria.",
		"7" : "The solid bass-baritone Matthew Brook, as the king; the spirited tenor Tyson Miller, as Odoardo, the king’s aide; and the sweet-voiced tenor David Portillo, as Ariodante’s devoted brother, were all excellent. Mr. Bicket’s superb players brought clarity and suppleness to their stylish and refined playing. We can look forward to the English Concert’s next Handel installment, when it returns in spring 2018 with “Rinaldo.”"

		"2" : "Among the comedy writing in-crowd, however, her mother, Kathy, is nearly as well known.",
		"3" : "Kathy Wigfield may be the only 61-year-old paralegal from suburban New Jersey who texts regularly with Mindy Kaling — her daughter’s former boss on “The Mindy Project” — and spent a family vacation at Disney World with Ms. Fey. At a party after the “30 Rock” finale in 2013, Jack McBrayer, who played Kenneth the page, approached Mrs. Wigfield and told her, “You’re like everyone’s mom.”",
		"4" : "Sitting beside her daughter recently over frittatas at Sarabeth’s on Central Park South, Mrs. Wigfield laughed at the memory. “I look at them as like my little kids,” she said, smiling.",
		"5" : "Now, Wigfield mother and daughter, who speak every day and call each other their best friends, are having an onscreen moment. Their relationship inspired “Great News,” which features a New Jersey mother named Carol Wendelson — played with septuagenarian pizazz by Andrea Martin — who lands an internship at the local TV news station where her daughter, Katie (Briga Heelan), works as a producer.",
		"6" : "Carol proceeds to insert herself into every aspect of her child’s professional and personal life. Sound familiar? “I wanted to write about her because she was a funny character in my life,” Ms. Wigfield, 33, said as her mother fussed with her daughter’s clothing — couldn’t she have worn a better shirt? — and discussed their plans to see that evening’s performance of “Dear Evan Hansen.”",
		"7" : "“My mother’s crazy,” Ms. Wigfield added. “But I’m also really into my mom.”",
		"8" : "Carol Wendelson is closely modeled after Kathy Wigfield, down to her head-to-toe outfits from the retailer Chico’s. When Mrs. Wigfield visited the “Great News” set in Los Angeles last year, she encountered Ms. Martin in full costume — coincidentally wearing the same colorful paisley-print top.",
		"9" : "In real life, Mrs. Wigfield is not a stage mom in the classic overbearing sense. It was her daughter’s idea to try show business, not hers. “She used to say, ‘Get me a manager so we can go on auditions,’ ” Mrs. Wigfield recalled. “I didn’t know how to begin doing that.”",
		"10" : "Ms. Wigfield acted in commercials as a child, including an ad for a toy called the Glitterator that featured her shouting, “It’s Glitter-ific!” She later interned at David Letterman’s “Late Show” before landing at “30 Rock.”",
		"11" : "“Tina recognized her wonderful talent,” recalled David Miner, a “30 Rock” executive producer who, along with several other alumni from the show, is working on “Great News.” “There are a lot of people who aren’t really ready to run their own show. Tracey was so ready for this.”",
		"12" : "After “30 Rock,” Ms. Wigfield decamped to Los Angeles for a senior position at “The Mindy Project,” where she was a writer, a co-executive producer and played a small onscreen role. (In “Great News,” she plays Beth, an oddball meteorologist.) She signed a development deal with Universal Studios and ran the mother-daughter idea by Ms. Fey, who quickly approved.",
		"13" : "Ms. Fey and her creative partner Robert Carlock are executive producers of “Great News,” and offered weekly input on scripts via Skype from New York to the writers’ room in Los Angeles. The show, set in the lower-rent waters of local TV news, is taped on set that is a near-copy of the NY1 studio in Manhattan, where the pilot was filmed.",

		"15" : "Her mother, she recalled, often accosts network executives at events, including Robert Greenblatt, NBC’s head of entertainment. “She would corner NBC execs and be like, ‘Do you know anyone at ‘Days of Our Lives’?” Tracey Wigfield said, laughing. At one point, Mrs. Wigfield talked a producer of “General Hospital” into hiring her other daughter, Ashley, for a small role.",
		"16" : "“Knowing my mom, she without a doubt could have been a great agent, or an executive, or a TV writer, or a million things,” Ms. Wigfield said, her mother beaming beside her. “My mom and women of her generation weren’t pushed in the same way I was.”",
		"17" : "During a recent taping, Ms. Wigfield was fully comfortable leading a team of dozens, joking with cast members, conferring with her director between takes and ironing out details on set. At one point, she and other writers were brainstorming ideas for which faded celebrity they could turn into a wax-figure prop.",
		"18" : "“Can we get Justin Guarini? What’s he doing?” Ms. Wigfield asked, referring to the now-obscure “From Justin to Kelly” co-star. Somebody suggested Richard Hatch from “Survivor.” Would the Menendez brothers work?",

		"20" : "Despite living across the country, her mother is never far away. She visited her daughter’s set several times, leading to a few pranks in which crew members sneaked her into scenes, surprising the younger Ms. Wigfield.",
		"21" : "Last spring, Ms. Wigfield’s pilot was picked up by NBC a week before her wedding; she had a honeymoon in Italy before rushing back to Los Angeles to start production. Over brunch, Ms. Wigfield recalled that she and her mother spent New Year’s reminiscing about their momentous 2016.",
		"22" : "“Your favorite was when my show got picked up,” Ms. Wigfield, one eyebrow arched, reminded her mother. “Not my wedding.”",
		"23" : "The matriarch threw up her hands. “I didn’t sit around thinking, ‘Oh, one day when she gets married … ’” Mrs. Wigfield explained. “Anybody can get married! I’m happy she found the guy she did.”",

		"3" : "Many of the more revealing moments in this volume will be familiar to readers of Obama’s own memoir, “Dreams From My Father”; a host of earlier books about Obama and his family; and myriad profiles of the former president that have appeared in newspapers and magazines over the years. Garrow has turned up little that’s substantially new — save for identifying and interviewing an old girlfriend from Obama’s early Chicago years, who claims that by 1987, “he already had his sights on becoming president.”",
		"4" : "In the absence of thoughtful analysis or a powerful narrative through line, Garrow’s book settles for barraging the reader with a cascade of details — seemingly in hopes of creating a kind of pointillist picture. The problem is that all these data points never connect to form an illuminating portrait; the book does not open out to become the sort of resonant narrative that Robert A. Caro and Ron Chernow have pioneered, in which momentous historical events are deftly recreated, and a subject’s life is situated in a time and a place. Instead, Garrow has expended a huge amount of energy — his bibliography, including interviews with more than a thousand people, runs to 35 pages — on giving us minutely detailed accounts of early chapters of Obama’s life, like his years at Harvard Law School, his time in Chicago as a community organizer, and his work in the Illinois State Senate. Garrow gets to Obama’s presidency only in an epilogue.",
		"5" : "While the Chicago chapter sheds valuable light on Obama’s connection with black residents and his developing sense of vocation, many of the other sections that try to chronicle his day-to-day life feel extraneous and absurdly long-winded, as if Garrow wanted to include every last scrap of information he’d unearthed. Are we really interested in what numerous Obama classmates, colleagues and passing acquaintances remember about his personality — that he struck them as cool or friendly, arrogant or voluble, cheerful or detached? Do we really want to read repetitious discussions about his cigarette consumption and poker-playing habits?",
		"6" : "Indeed, this entire book suffers from a poor sense of proportion. Garrow adds nothing to our understanding of Obama’s intellectual evolution during his years at Columbia, or the role that the civil rights movement played in shaping his political consciousness and ideals. (Curious, given that Garrow, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his book on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “Bearing the Cross.”) And yet Garrow prattles on for pages about legislation Obama worked on in the Illinois State Senate, and about discussions in law school classes he attended or taught. The entire first chapter of the book is devoted to examining the social and political landscape of Chicago’s South Side in the early 1980s before Obama arrived to work there, but Obama’s 2008 campaign and two terms in the White House are compressed into a 50-odd-page epilogue.",
		"7" : "Perhaps, as the title “Rising Star” indicates, this book is meant to focus only on Obama’s early years, but in that case, the epilogue — with the snarky title of “The President Did Not Attend, as He Was Golfing” — seems even more inexplicable.",
		"8" : "Whereas the rest of the book is written in dry, largely uninflected prose, the epilogue — which almost reads like a Republican attack ad — devolves into a condescending diatribe unworthy of a serious historian. It consists mainly of a string of negative quotations about Obama’s presidency and temperament, many plucked out of context from articles and books by journalists and commentators, or extracted from disillusioned former friends or supporters. There is no considered weighing of the record, no real recognition of the achievements of Obama’s two terms in office (including his handling of the financial crisis that he inherited and passing Obamacare). Nor is there any useful explication of the policy decisions (like flip-flopping on Syria, and failing to close a deal enabling a sizable number of American forces to remain in Iraq beyond 2011) that have elicited sustained criticism from both government insiders and outside experts.",
		"9" : "Instead, Garrow’s epilogue delivers a crude screed against Obama the president and Obama the man, filled with bald assertions and coy half-truths. He suggests that Obama’s presidency was a long string of failures and disappointments and that “behind the scenes, many Democrats were just as eager for Barack to exit the White House as he himself now seemed,” when, in fact, he left office as one of the most popular presidents in recent decades.",
		"10" : "Garrow takes Obama to task for his lack of “bipartisan outreach” with Republican members of Congress, but doesn’t tell the other side of the story — namely, the Republicans’ deliberate strategy of obstructionism throughout Obama’s tenure in office. (The Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell famously declared, “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.”) And, as the chapter title indicates, Garrow even mocks Obama, repeatedly, for spending too much time on the golf course. (What, one wonders, would he make of Donald J. Trump?)",
		"11" : "Then there is the innuendo. Garrow portentously cites a poll indicating that 64 percent of Republicans and 42 percent of whites agreed that it was “probably true” that Obama was “hiding important information about his background and early life.” This could be a reference to the birther movement, or perhaps to the bitter musings of Sheila Miyoshi Jager, the former girlfriend Obama had met in Chicago — who remained upset for years over their breakup, and whom Garrow has turned into one of his main sources. Jager is quoted as saying that “something changed” in Obama “after we went our separate ways after Harvard, as if the part of him that was so vulnerable and open (and sensual?) went underground and something else — raging ambition, quest for greatness, whatever just took over instead.”",
		"12" : "It’s odd that Garrow should seize on one former lover’s anger and hurt, and try to turn them into a Rosebud-like key to the former president’s life, referring to her repeatedly in his epilogue. He even tries to turn her perception — about Obama’s having willed himself into being — into a pejorative, when the act of self-invention, as other biographers have noted, was the enterprising and existential act of a young man who essentially had been abandoned by both his black father and white mother, and who found himself caught between cultures and trying, as he wrote in “Dreams,” “to raise myself to be a black man in America.”",
		"13" : "Perhaps Garrow leans so heavily on Jager because she is a source mentioned only in passing (and not by name) in David Maraniss’s “Barack Obama: The Story” (2012). It’s telling, after all, that Garrow mischaracterizes the reception that both Maraniss’s biography and David Remnick’s incisive book “The Bridge” received, suggesting that both volumes failed to get the accolades they did, in fact, receive.",
		"14" : "The reader interested in Barack Obama’s life would do well to turn to those books, and not Garrow’s overstuffed and ultimately unfair work here. Or, go back to Obama’s own eloquent memoir."

		"1" : "In a move that highlights the increasing pressures faced by stock pickers on Wall Street, Peter S. Kraus, the chief executive of AllianceBernstein Holding, was ousted by the money manager’s controlling shareholder on Monday.",
		"2" : "The abrupt shake-up, which included the appointment of six new members to the AllianceBernstein board and the removal of nine, comes as investors continue to abandon higher-priced, actively managed mutual funds in favor of cheaper exchange-traded funds that track a wide variety of stock and bond indexes.",
		"3" : "AllianceBernstein, an institutional fund manager rooted in a culture of active stock management, has seen investors take their money elsewhere in recent years despite efforts by Mr. Kraus to reverse the company’s fortunes.",
		"4" : "As part of the reshuffling, Axa Financial, the French insurance giant that owns the firm, named as Alliance’s chairman Robert B. Zoellick, a former president of the World Bank and senior economic official in Republican administrations.",
		"5" : "Mr. Zoellick did have a stint with Goldman Sachs, but he has no hands-on experience in the asset management industry.",
		"6" : "Seth Bernstein, a longtime JPMorgan Chase executive, was named chief executive.",
		"7" : "According to a regulatory filing, Axa has agreed to buy Mr. Kraus’s 4.3 million shares of Alliance stock, a transaction that will net him about $100 million.",
		"8" : "Wall Street chief executives have been fired before, but such an extensive reshuffling — suddenly removing nine directors — is unusual. Alliance, or AB, as the firm has recently rebranded itself, manages about $500 billion, with a focus on managing bond and equity portfolios for large institutions like pension and sovereign wealth funds.",
		"9" : "And while there had been outflows and some ups and downs in performance, analysts had been saying that Mr. Kraus’s strategy had been showing some signs of success.",
		"10" : "The firm had sought regulatory approval for starting a suite of funds in which the investor fee would rise or fall depending on performance.",
		"11" : "And fund returns have been respectable of late. According to Credit Suisse, 74 percent of AB funds were ranked four or five stars by Morningstar, a figure that far surpassed those of larger active managers like Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price.",
		"12" : "The shake-up came as a shock to employees, most of whom left work on Friday believing that Mr. Kraus was their leader, according to an employee who declined to be identified.",
		"13" : "Over the weekend, though, Axa moved quickly to make the change.",
		"14" : "On a conference call on Monday, analysts who cover the stock challenged the chairman of Axa, Denis Duverne, asking him repeatedly why he had decided on such an extreme step given the firm’s improved performance in recent quarters.",
		"15" : "One analyst asked if there were other issues, perhaps related to the company’s finances, that drove the board to act as it did.",
		"16" : "“There were no concerns about anything,” Mr. Duverne said. “Its just an acceleration of the changes with the new team.”",
		"17" : "On the call, Mr. Duverne took pains to say that he was supportive of the direction Mr. Kraus had taken the firm. But Mr. Duverne also left little doubt that he wanted the company to adapt more rapidly to the changes rattling the fund management world.",
		"18" : "“We are not here to challenge what has been done in the past,” he said. “We want to adjust the company to the new structure of the industry.”",
		"19" : "According to Morningstar, 36 percent of the mutual funds it tracks now follow passive strategies — up from 16 percent 10 years ago. Morningstar believes that the share of index-driven strategies will increase to 48 percent by 2021.",
		"20" : "Active managers have been struggling for years to come up with a strategy for confronting the tremendous flow of money to passive investment strategies, but the recent pickup in money moving to exchange-traded funds is forcing many to act sooner rather than later.",
		"21" : "The industry leaders, Vanguard and BlackRock, have attracted record-setting amounts into their exchange-traded-fund lineups.",
		"22" : "Asset management experts and executives have warned that a vast reordering of the sector is inevitable.",
		"23" : "“We are going to see a large consolidation in the asset management industry,” Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, said at a mutual fund conference on Friday. He said managers were having a hard time finding returns that beat the market benchmark.",
		"24" : "That it was Mr. Kraus who took the fall for his industry’s troubles was noteworthy.",
		"25" : "More than most of his peers, Mr. Kraus, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs who had led Alliance since 2008, had said loudly and repeatedly that a rush of money into exchange-traded funds posed a danger to market stability.",
		"26" : "To counter this trend, Mr. Kraus pushed for concentrated investment approaches, in which managers focus on a small group of companies that they strongly believe will perform well. His move to adjust fees to performance was also a bold move to address investor concerns regarding high-cost funds.",
		"27" : "But in a marketplace that had become enamored with lower-cost index options, his strategy had not yet yielded significant gains in money flowing into the firm. Axa decided not to wait any longer."

		"1" : "Over his career, James C. Woolery has ventured from the law to investment banking and hedge funds.",
		"2" : "Now he is preparing to return to life as a lawyer once more, at his third law firm in six years.",
		"3" : "Mr. Woolery announced on Monday that he was joining King & Spalding, a firm that aims to join the top rungs of the legal industry. There, he will serve as the head of the firm’s mergers and corporate governance practices, overseeing both takeovers and defenses against activist investors who want to shake up companies.",
		"4" : "“Given his background and résumé, his deal list and his experience, it’s a significant hire for the firm,” Robert D. Hays, King & Spalding’s chairman, said in a telephone interview.",
		"5" : "Mr. Woolery said he wanted to help companies be more proactive in warding off activist investors. He will also help guide King & Spalding’s network of lead board directors, who take leadership roles on boards, on discussions of corporate governance practices.",
		"6" : "“What we want to do is try to innovate around the whole spectrum of corporate governance, including activism and shareholder relations,” Mr. Woolery said. “We’re going to bring not only a legal but also an economic analysis to the effort, as well as get beyond the traditional confrontational approaches.”",
		"7" : "Mr. Woolery first rose through the deal industry at the white-shoe law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he made partner and worked on big deals involving the likes of Universal Health Services and Air Products.",
		"8" : "In 2011, he followed in the footsteps of several former Cravath partners and jumped over to investment banking, joining JPMorgan Chase as co-head of the bank’s North American mergers practice.",

		"10" : "Yet Mr. Woolery zagged again in 2015, when he and a former JPMorgan colleague founded Hudson Executive Capital, an activist hedge fund with a twist: It would never wage a hostile fight against a company, instead preferring to press for change on friendly terms. Mr. Woolery resigned from Hudson Executive last autumn.",
		"11" : "As Mr. Woolery weighed his options, King & Spalding began to reach out. He knew of the firm, as well as some of its partners. One, William Calvin Smith III, was in his undergraduate class at Wake Forest University. For King & Spalding, the chance to bring in a well-known deal maker offered the prospect of greater prominence in one of the most profitable legal practices around.",

		"13" : "But it has been growing rapidly. The firm now has 1,000 lawyers in 19 offices around the world, having opened outposts from Silicon Valley to Switzerland to Saudi Arabia. Its net income has risen 60 percent over the last five years, according to Mr. Hays, the chairman. Profits per partner now total about $2.5 million, according to the publication American Lawyer.",
		"14" : "For Mr. Woolery, who focused on building out Cravath’s business development during his time there, joining King & Spalding means working to give the firm more of the stature held by mergers stalwarts like Cravath; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; or Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.",
		"15" : "“When you go to a business that’s more mature, that has its advantages and its disadvantages,” Mr. Woolery said. “A powerful brand is an important thing.”",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "John A. Paulson is one of the best-known names in the hedge fund industry. But these days, Mr. Paulson is having more success in the political realm than he is managing his business.",
		"2" : "Mr. Paulson, 61, was one of the first people on Wall Street to back Donald J. Trump’s bid for the presidency. He counseled Mr. Trump on economic matters during the campaign. He gave $250,000 to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. And he recently visited President Trump at the White House for a “C.E.O. Town Hall.”",
		"3" : "But his investors are unlikely to be impressed by his political access. His firm, Paulson & Company, has recorded nearly double-digit losses in several of its larger funds as of the end of March.",
		"4" : "That dismal record is a far cry from nearly a decade ago, when Mr. Paulson made nearly $15 billion betting on the collapse of the housing market. Back then, state pension funds and investors around the world rushed to give him their money to manage. Even Mr. Trump became an investor with Mr. Paulson — and eventually lost money.",
		"5" : "Mr. Paulson’s struggles come after a gut-wrenching 2016, when he recorded even steeper losses in those funds, partly because of several wrong-footed bets on drug makers, including the troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals. That followed a painful 2015, when investors first balked and began pulling their money from his firm.",
		"6" : "A representative of Mr. Paulson declined a request for an interview with him. His funds are said to have performed better in April, said a person with knowledge of the firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
		"7" : "Despite his mounting losses, there is little indication that Mr. Paulson, who donated $400 million to Harvard University’s school of engineering in 2015, is throwing his hands up and walking away.",
		"8" : "“It is clear that Paulson has dug in with both heels and committed to steering the firm through this period,” said David Black, founder of Quadra Advisors, a recruiting firm for hedge funds and other investment firms.",
		"9" : "Nonetheless, his assets under management continue shrinking. Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011. Nearly two years ago, some Wall Street banks began to recommend that investors redeem some of their money from the firm.",
		"10" : "And while Mr. Paulson is not the only hedge fund manager to see large investors pull their money in recent years, he has become a symbol of what some pension funds have taken issue with for the industry at large: big fees for little reward and little originality.",
		"11" : "Mr. Paulson has remained upbeat with investors, according to two people who have seen recent investor letters but spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
		"12" : "“While we are disappointed in performance in 2016, we believe we have a path to a recovery,” Mr. Paulson told investors in one letter.",
		"13" : "But it has not been smooth sailing. In another letter to investors of a merger arbitrage fund that declined by 49 percent last year, Mr. Paulson called 2016 “the most challenging year since inception.” In May, Mr. Paulson will address his investors at a meeting at Claridge’s Hotel in London.",
		"14" : "Mr. Paulson’s fall from stock-trading stardom underscores a common disclaimer in industry parlance: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.",
		"15" : "In early 2007, Mr. Paulson, who started his firm in 1994, was still a relatively unknown hedge fund manager. A former Bear Stearns investment banker, he had a reputation for running a solid if boring hedge fund that made bets on the outcomes of various mergers and acquisitions.",
		"16" : "But as the housing market began to show signs of overheating, Mr. Paulson had a hunch that home loans to borrowers with spotty credit histories — which were ballooning at the time — were about to go sour. He positioned his firm to benefit in the event of a huge failure of the subprime mortgage market.",
		"17" : "It was a bet that few were willing to take, but one that resulted in a major payday for him and his firm, and was later referred to as “The Greatest Trade Ever,” in a book by the reporter Gregory Zuckerman.",
		"18" : "After the financial crisis, investors flocked to Mr. Paulson’s firm, which is in Midtown Manhattan, a stone’s throw from Rockefeller Center.",
		"19" : "For several years, Paulson & Company continued to make money for some of his investors, but the performance increasingly grew bumpy. This was particularly true for the firm’s flagship Advantage fund. It lost 36 percent in 2011 and plunged another 14 percent in 2012, but rallied to post a 26 percent gain in 2013, according to an HSBC industry report and people with knowledge of the firm’s performance. The losses were amplified in Advantage Plus, a version of the fund that uses leverage to enhance returns.",
		"20" : "Over the last three years, Advantage has consecutively recorded double-digit losses. Some of Mr. Paulson’s merger funds, credit funds and gold funds have posted positive returns, but the overall picture has not been pretty.",
		"21" : "But Mr. Paulson soldiered on and even began to raise money in 2015 for a private equity fund and one focused on health care stocks.",
		"22" : "Health care bets, in particular those on pharmaceutical companies, have proved especially punishing for Mr. Paulson and his investors. Losing wagers on economic recoveries in Greece and Puerto Rico haven’t helped.",
		"23" : "The Valeant trade resulted in a nearly $2 billion loss for the firm — bad, but not as disastrous as it was for another famed investor, William A. Ackman, whose firm Pershing Square Capital Management lost $4 billion on Valeant.",
		"24" : "Some of Mr. Paulson’s top talent have moved on. Putnam Coes, his former chief operating officer, left the firm in September. Soon after, John Reade, a senior vice president who was based in London, left.",
		"25" : "Despite his losses, Mr. Paulson is still making new and speculative investments. In November, Paulson made an investment in Didi Chuxing, a fast-growing Chinese ride-hailing firm that signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies’ operations in China.",
		"26" : "One bright spot could be a bet on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
		"27" : "Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has pledged to return the mortgage finance giants to free-standing publicly traded companies, a development that could make Mr. Paulson’s funds big profits. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, once worked together to pull OneWest Bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008.",
		"28" : "Several new funds the firm has started are posting positive returns, too.",
		"29" : "“We remain confident in the long-term relationship we have with Paulson,” said Christopher Zook of CAZ Investments, a Texas wealth management firm that recently rotated out of the poorly performing Paulson Special Situations fund into a newer Paulson fund.",
		"30" : "And Mr. Paulson and other hedge fund managers stand to be big beneficiaries of Mr. Trump’s plans to slash taxes.",
		"31" : "Yet 2017 is shaping up as another rough one for Mr. Paulson. The Advantage fund was down 9.7 percent as of the end of March and the Partners Enhanced fund continues to sink — falling just over 8 percent after last year’s 49 percent plunge.",
		"32" : "Even after several years of losing money for his investors, Mr. Paulson remains one of the richest men in the world — with a net worth of about $7.9 billion, according to Forbes.",
		"33" : "But, as the financial magazine recently noted, he is now $2 billion poorer."

		"1" : "The media industry has been rife with consolidation in recent years: Cable companies, film studios and telecommunications firms have all been bought and sold at a rapid clip.",
		"2" : "Now, local television stations are at the center of the deal-making frenzy.",
		"3" : "Last week, a day after the Federal Communications Commission eased regulations over how many stations an owner may have, Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest local broadcast group in the country, said it would buy 14 New York-based stations for $240 million.",
		"4" : "The timing of Sinclair’s deal may not have hinged directly on the change, but it demonstrated a demand for broadcast station mergers. Sinclair did not reply to requests for comment.",
		"5" : "And now, a bidding war has begun over Tribune Media, the owner of WGN America and, in New York, PIX 11.",
		"6" : "The Blackstone Group appears to be working with 21st Century Fox on a bid for Tribune. And Sinclair is also circling that company.",
		"7" : "“The F.C.C. has basically said: ‘Game on. We’re going to let you consolidate further than anyone had imagined,’” said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.",
		"8" : "Consolidation of local broadcast stations could lead to more expensive fees for consumers as providers pass on ever-higher fees from broadcasters and content creators to subscribers. But to media companies, the mantra of late has been that bigger is better.",
		"9" : "For broadcast station companies in particular — including Sinclair, Fox and the Nexstar Media Group — owning more stations increases their power over cable companies, which pay to retransmit the stations.",
		"10" : "Fox’s motive for pursuing Tribune, which has more Fox affiliates than any other station owner, largely appears to be blocking a deal with Sinclair. It plans to form a joint venture with the Blackstone Group, an investment giant, in which Blackstone would provide the cash for a deal while Fox would provide its own television stations, according to people briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.",
		"11" : "If successful, Fox would then reduce its direct exposure to local television stations, Mr. Greenfield said, while still holding on to a piece — and while stymieing a rival.",
		"12" : "Details of the potential joint venture were unclear, as were the precise reasons that Fox was turning to Blackstone. Tribune is a relatively small company, with a market value of about $3.4 billion.",
		"13" : "But for companies like Fox and Sinclair, consolidation is also a defensive move, shoring them up at a time when online rivals like Netflix and Hulu are commanding more viewers. Content providers like CBS and the Walt Disney Company are also pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.",
		"14" : "And local television advertising sales, excluding political ads and the Olympics, were roughly flat last year, according to the research from Magna Global, with expectations that 2017 will be even tougher.",
		"15" : "Getting bigger through station acquisitions, then, is meant to help these companies drive harder bargains. And smaller operators have emerged as potential takeover targets: The stock prices of two other broadcast companies, E. W. Scripps and Gray Television, are both up sharply this year.",
		"16" : "Underpinning broadcasters’ dreams of expansion is the hope that Ajit Pai, the F.C.C.’s new chairman and a Republican, will let through the kinds of deal making that had been held up during the Obama administration.",
		"17" : "“Companies are talking about deals now because they have reason to believe the F.C.C. will relax all the ownership rules,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company.",
		"18" : "The first tangible step came with a 2-to-1 vote by the F.C.C. last week to reintroduce the so-called UHF discount.",
		"19" : "Longstanding rules prohibit companies from covering more than 39 percent of American households, but the UHF discount allows station owners to exclude certain stations that operate in ultrahigh frequencies. With the reinstated discount, according to calculations by Fitch Ratings, Sinclair’s household coverage percentage has fallen to about 25 percent, from 38 percent, while Nexstar’s has dropped to 27 percent, from 39 percent, opening the door to new mergers and acquisitions.",
		"20" : "“This represents a rational first step in media ownership reform policy allowing free and local broadcasters to remain competitive with multinational pay TV giants and broadband providers,” Gordon Smith, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said in a statement.",
		"21" : "The F.C.C.’s rule change followed pressure from industry groups. One week before the vote, Mitch Rose, NBC Universal’s senior vice president for government relations, visited the office of the other Republican commissioner on the F.C.C., Michael O’Reilly, urging him to reinstate the UHF discount.",
		"22" : "And in February, Tribune Media’s general counsel, Edward Lazarus, met with Mr. Pai’s chief of staff, Matthew Berry, and lobbied for the change in rules.",
		"23" : "Mr. Pai has long been critical of strict broadcast ownership rules. He has said that online media companies such as Google, Facebook and Netflix are competing for audiences that were once served only by television. He has also been skeptical of rules against broadcast ownership limits, given that the agency has approved mergers in competing industries, including Charter’s purchase of Time Warner Cable and AT&T’s purchase of DirecTV.",
		"24" : "At the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas last week, Mr. Pai announced his intention to re-examine other media ownership rules. Broadcasters hope that one limit that may be removed is a prohibition on owning more than two stations in a local market.",
		"25" : "Consumer groups and Democrats in Congress and at the F.C.C. warn that the changes will lead to great industry consolidation, giving a few companies great influence over news and public opinion.",
		"26" : "The action “will actually harm the public interest, by reducing diversity, competition and localism,” Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat at the F.C.C., said after the UHF discount vote.",
		"27" : "In a letter to Mr. Pai last month, Democratic House members argued against both the UHF discount and a union of Sinclair and Tribune. Such a merger, they contended, could lead to higher cable fees because Sinclair charges cable companies more than Tribune does to retransmit its broadcasts.",
		"28" : "“These were mergers that could never have been contemplated a year ago,” Mr. Greenfield, of BTIG, said of the deals that might blossom under the new F.C.C. “You’re enabling the impossible in many ways, so people are saying, ‘Let’s take a shot at this.’”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "HOUSTON — The Trump administration is moving to make the United States the world’s leading exporter of natural gas as a central component of both energy and trade policy.",
		"2" : "But whether global markets, currently awash with gas, will play along remains a long shot over the next several years. Any breakdown of talks to remodel the North American Free Trade Agreement, which set the regulatory framework that allowed gas exports to Mexico to triple over the last six years, could also get in the way.",
		"3" : "The administration’s ambitions were explained emphatically last month by Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and they were followed up by the Energy Department’s authorization last Tuesday for a Texas export terminal that Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum have pursued for years. Other administration plans include opening the way for more gas exports from Oregon to serve Asia.",
		"4" : "In recent years, there was strong domestic opposition to the exports, from manufacturers and others, out of fear that domestic gas prices would rise, and the Obama administration moved cautiously before increasing the pace of export terminal permit approvals during its second term.",
		"5" : "With supplies appearing bountiful, and other countries aiming to increase their own production, opposition has mostly abated, except in pockets of the East Coast and Pacific Northwest. There remains enthusiastic support along the gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas, where there is substantial room for more growth.",
		"6" : "For the Trump administration, the economic benefits of gas export infrastructure are paramount. Each natural gas export terminal can require an investment of $10 billion or more, produce thousands of construction jobs and consume millions of pounds of steel. Then there is the additional drilling and production of gas, which is then cooled to minus 260 degrees, condensing it to a liquid known as liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to be shipped on giant tankers to Asian, European and Latin American markets.",
		"7" : "The recent expansion of the Panama Canal has quickened the route to growing markets in Japan, South Korea and elsewhere in Asia, making American gas more competitive.",
		"8" : "“Exporting L.N.G. meets many objectives, including helping to address the trade imbalance,” said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit, a consultancy. “This supports jobs, this supports investment in energy, this supports exports, a whole host of administration objectives.”",
		"9" : "Once six facilities under construction or being expanded are completed over the next few years, the additional liquefied gas exports could amount to as much as $50 billion in annual revenue, depending on gas prices. Much of that would help balance the trade deficit with China, an administration objective.",
		"10" : "Additionally, four big pipelines are being built this year to take more gas to Mexico, and at least two more are slated to begin transporting gas by the end of 2018. With Mexico converting its power sector to natural gas from fuel oil, the country already imports more than 5 percent of United States gas production, which particularly helps Texas gas producers and pipeline companies.",
		"11" : "To some extent, even American coal companies could benefit from more gas exports, because exporting natural gas tends to support its price. That is important because inexpensive gas has been the leading enemy of the shrinking coal industry, a head-to-head competitor.",
		"12" : "Proponents in the State and Energy Departments have also long argued that more gas exports can provide better security to energy-hungry allies like Japan; lessen the dependence of Europe on Russia, which has been known to use gas as a political weapon; and speed up the replacement of coal with gas to curb climate change.",
		"13" : "But construction has begun on so many terminals in recent years in Australia, Malaysia, Russia and the United States that supplies of liquefied gas shipped in tankers are expected to increase by nearly 50 percent over the next five years while global gas demand is increasing by less than 2 percent a year.",
		"14" : "In the United States alone, where Cheniere Energy began major liquefied gas exports only last year, shipments are expected to jump to nearly six billion cubic feet a day from the current 1.5 billion cubic feet a day by the end of the decade as a cluster of projects are completed on the gulf coast.",
		"15" : "The momentum for start-ups hit a wall over the last two years worldwide, and four United States projects approved in recent years have not yet begun construction. Companies have been content to complete the permitting process, seek financing and markets, and develop construction plans in the hope they can act fast in case the market turns around.",
		"16" : "“The pace follows the market and not the wishes of the U.S. government,” said Nikos Tsafos, president and chief analyst at the consultancy Enalytica. “No one is really out there fishing for new projects right now.”",
		"17" : "The gas business is cyclical, and proponents say it is only a matter of time before demand picks up. China and India are increasingly turning to gas to replace coal and improve the air quality of their cities. Gas demand for transport is growing in Iran, Pakistan and Argentina. Germany has largely given up on nuclear power, and it needs natural gas to replace some of the lost power.",
		"18" : "Some L.N.G. executives say that the global demand for gas will grow as more export and import terminals are built and that the United States will continue to have a cost advantage over other major producers, including Qatar and Russia, because of the abundance of American gas production.",
		"19" : "“It’s been demonstrated over the last two years that when you have low natural gas prices, demand increases much faster than what people think,” said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a Houston company developing a $15 billion L.N.G. export project south of Lake Charles, La.",
		"20" : "“The Trump administration has discovered the power of natural gas,” Mr. Souki added. “Today, we are the top gas producer in the world, and in another three or four years, we’ll be one of the top two gas exporters in the world, right up there with Russia.”",
		"21" : "That is certainly what the Trump administration is hoping for, although its policies may not have much of an immediate impact.",
		"22" : "“We could be and should be the largest exporter of L.N.G. in the world,” Mr. Cohn said at a Washington conference in April. He said the first thing the administration would do was issue a permit for an export facility in the Northwest, a reference to the Jordan Cove L.N.G. terminal in the Oregon port of Coos Bay, where a Canadian company, Veresen, has proposed to build.",
		"23" : "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last year denied a permit to the terminal as well as a pipeline to link it to production, saying the pipe would have “adverse effects on landowners.” There was also strong opposition from local environmental groups.",
		"24" : "The commission can reconsider the issue, but not any time soon, because three of its five seats are vacant and the Senate has been known to take months to confirm commission nominations.",
		"25" : "With additional fanfare, the Energy Department last week authorized Golden Pass Products, a partnership between Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum, to export domestically produced gas from the Texas coast.",
		"26" : "“This is not only good for our economy and American jobs but also assists other countries with their energy security,” said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who championed the oil and gas industry as Texas governor.",
		"27" : "The Golden Pass facility, originally designed for gas imports before the shale production boom created a glut, has largely remained dormant for the last six years. With an additional investment of $10 billion or so, the plant could become a force on international markets and export two billion cubic feet of gas a day, nearly 3 percent of current American gas production.",
		"28" : "Golden Pass claims construction of the facility would mean 45,000 direct and indirect jobs over five years, and 3,800 direct and indirect permanent jobs.",
		"29" : "The partnership released a one-line statement in response to the administration announcement: “Golden Pass Products is pleased to have achieved this important regulatory milestone as we continue to work to develop the export opportunity.”",
		"30" : "But executives noted that the companies had not yet made a final decision on whether to go ahead with the investment."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LONDON — In the battle against fake news, Andreas Vlachos — a Greek computer scientist living in a northern English town — is on the front lines.",
		"2" : "Armed with a decade of machine learning expertise, he is part of a British start-up that will soon release an automated fact-checking tool ahead of the country’s election in early June. He also is advising a global competition that pits computer wizards from the United States to China against each other to use artificial intelligence to combat fake news.",
		"3" : "“I’m trying to channel my research into something that is useful for everyone who’s reading the news,” said Mr. Vlachos, who is also an academic at the University of Sheffield. “It’s a positive way of moving artificial intelligence forward while improving the political debate.”",
		"4" : "As Europe readies for several elections this year after President Trump’s victory in the United States, Mr. Vlachos, 36, is one of a growing number of technology experts worldwide who are harnessing their skills to tackle misinformation online.",
		"5" : "The French electorate heads to the polls in the second round of presidential elections on May 7, followed by votes in Britain and Germany in the coming months. Computer scientists, tech giants and start-ups are using sophisticated algorithms and reams of online data to quickly — and automatically — spot fake news faster than traditional fact-checking groups can.",
		"6" : "The goal, experts say, is to expand these digital tools across Europe, so the region can counter the fake news that caused so much confusion and anger during the United States presidential election in November, when outright false reports routinely spread like wildfire on Facebook and Twitter.",
		"7" : "“Algorithms will have to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to fighting misinformation,” said Claire Wardle, head of strategy and research at First Draft News, a nonprofit organization that has teamed up with tech companies and newsrooms to debunk fake reports about elections in the United States and Europe. “It’s impossible to do all of this by hand.”",
		"8" : "Researchers have tried to learn from the United States’ run-in with fake news, but the problem in Europe has mutated, experts say, making it impossible to merely replicate American responses to the issue.",
		"9" : "European countries have different languages, and their media markets are smaller than those in the United States. That means groups that set up fake news sites in the United States, seeking to profit from online advertising when false claims were shared on social media, are less prevalent in Europe.",
		"10" : "So far, outright fake news stories have been relatively rare. Instead, false reports have more often come from Europeans on social media taking real news out of context, as well as from fake claims spread by state-backed groups like Sputnik, the Russian news organization.",
		"11" : "But with fake news already swirling around Europe’s forthcoming elections, analysts also worry that technology on its own may not be enough to combat the threat.",
		"12" : "“There’s an increased amount of misinformation out there,” said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, a think tank in Riga, Latvia, that will hold a hackathon with local coders in May to find potential tech solutions to this trend. “State-based actors have been trying to amplify specific views to bring them into the mainstream.”",
		"13" : "Calls for combating fake news have focused on some of the biggest online players, including American giants like Facebook and Google.",
		"14" : "After criticism of its role in spreading false reports during the United States elections, Facebook introduced a fact-checking tool ahead of the Dutch elections in March and the first round of the French presidential election on April 23. It also removed 30,000 accounts in France that had shared fake news, a small fraction of the approximately 33 million Facebook users in the country.",
		"15" : "Not everyone, though, has embraced Facebook’s response.",
		"16" : "Most German publishers, for instance, have so far balked at participating in the company’s fact-checking efforts, saying it is the responsibility of the social network, not them, to debunk such claims. German lawmakers are mulling potential hefty fines against tech companies if they do not clamp down on fake news and online hate speech.",
		"17" : "Since last year, Google also has funded almost 20 European projects aimed at fact-checking potentially false reports. That includes its support for two British groups looking to use artificial intelligence to automatically fact-check online claims ahead of the country’s June 8 parliamentary election.",
		"18" : "It similarly has teamed up with French newsrooms to create digital tools, including ways to track trending topics during that country’s election.",
		"19" : "David Dieudonné, head of the company’s news lab in France, said the project had debunked 43 reports since February (arguably a relatively small figure), including claims that Saudi Arabia was funding the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, the leading candidate.",
		"20" : "“We’re trying something new,” Mr. Dieudonné said. “There’s no easy answer for this complicated issue.”",
		"21" : "Not all potential solutions, though, are being driven by Silicon Valley’s big beasts.",
		"22" : "David Chavalarias, a French academic, has created a digital tool that has analyzed more than 80 million Twitter messages about the French election, helping journalists and fact-checkers to quickly review claims that are spread on the social network.",
		"23" : "After the presidential election in the United States last year, Dean Pomerleau, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, also challenged his followers on Twitter to come up with an algorithm that could distinguish fake claims from real news.",
		"24" : "Working with Delip Rao, a former Google researcher, he offered a $2,000 prize to anyone who could meet his requirements. By early this year, more than 100 teams from around the world had signed on to Mr. Pomerleau’s Fake News Challenge.",
		"25" : "Using a database of verified articles and their artificial intelligence expertise, rival groups — a combination of college teams, independent programmers and groups from existing tech companies — already have been able to accurately predict the veracity of certain claims almost 90 percent of the time, Mr. Pomerleau said. He hopes that figure will rise to the mid-90s before his challenge ends in June.",
		"26" : "“This is just Round 1 of what we want to do,” said Mr. Pomerleau, who expects the teams to share their work with fact-checking groups worldwide. “Next, we want to move toward multimedia content like videos.”",
		"27" : "In the rush to find solutions to fake news, some within the industry are taking a decidedly more low-tech approach.",
		"28" : "Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, recently started a crowdfunding campaign to create a news organization that would combine professional journalists with digital volunteers, who would contribute to reports in a way similar to how articles are created on Wikipedia.",
		"29" : "Part fact-checking site, part traditional newsroom, the project — called Wikitribune — was inspired by the effect of misinformation on the United States presidential election. Mr. Wales said his project would choose subject areas based on the interests of the community of volunteers and paying subscribers to the service, relying more on traditional reporting techniques than high-tech wizardry.",
		"30" : "“The real impetus for this was fake news,” he said. “We want people to get behind topics, and then we’ll hire staff to cover them.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "On Friday, the music industry woke up to the news that the Fyre Festival, promoted as a pair of luxurious concert weekends in the Bahamas, had been abruptly canceled, with attendees taking to social media to post images of shoddy beach accommodations and far-from-gourmet meals.",
		"2" : "And then, for the festival organizers, the legal and financial reckoning began.",
		"3" : "Over the weekend, one disappointed ticket buyer filed a lawsuit alleging fraud, and the Bahamian government sought to reassure travelers of the safety of the islands.",
		"4" : "The lawsuit, which seeks $100 million and class-action status, was filed by Mark J. Geragos, a celebrity lawyer who has represented Chris Brown and Kesha, on behalf of Daniel Jung, a Los Angeles man who, according to the suit, paid $2,000 for a ticket and airfare to the festival.",
		"5" : "The event, announced in December through a wave of Instagram posts by celebrities and supermodels, was advertised as including popular acts like Blink-182, Major Lazer, Migos and Rae Sremmurd. The rapper Ja Rule and his business partner, the 25-year-old technology entrepreneur Billy McFarland, were behind the festival, and attendees were promised music, catered meals and V.I.P. accommodations in a beach paradise.",
		"6" : "But once the first fans arrived on flights from Miami on Thursday, it was clear that the festival was not what it was promised to be. According to Mr. Jung’s suit, the scene “was closer to ‘The Hunger Games’ or ‘Lord of the Flies’ than Coachella.” (The protestations of the event’s wealthy young clientele, however, also drew plenty of social media schadenfreude.)",
		"7" : "In an email, Mr. Geragos said that “we have been inundated with people distraught over what happened” who wanted to join the suit, filed Sunday in federal court in California.",
		"8" : "Organizers issued a statement saying, “The Fyre Festival is a dream and a vision that we regrettably did not see come to life how we imagined in 2017, but our main priority now is rectifying the situation and helping all affected guests.”",
		"9" : "It is still not clear just how, or when, the event fell apart. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the performers had not been paid advances, but talent agents representing acts on the bill said the fees were eventually paid.",
		"10" : "Blink-182 withdrew on Thursday afternoon, telling its fans, “We’re not confident that we would have what we need to give you the quality of performances we always give.” Yet even that evening, agents for other acts were given no indications from organizers of trouble ahead.",
		"11" : "In a lengthy statement, the director general of the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Joy Jibrilu, defended Great Exuma, where the festival was to be held, as a developed island with a fully functioning infrastructure. And one more thing: “Despite reports, the waters surrounding Great Exuma are not shark-infested,” she said.",
		"12" : "Festival organizers have cited rough weather as one cause of complications at the event site but also admitted in a statement, “We were simply in over our heads.”",
		"13" : "In a presentation put together to entice investors, which was obtained by Vanity Fair, the festival organizers claimed they had been given access to land worth $8.4 million in exchange for putting on the festival and advertising the island. The Ministry of Tourism did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
		"14" : "The festival has told attendees they can have their tickets refunded or receive a V.I.P. ticket to Fyre Festival 2018, “which will take place at a U.S. beach venue.” Yet talent managers and others expressed doubt that anyone in the music industry would work with the Fyre team again.",
		"15" : "An email sent over the weekend to ticket holders included a link to an online form for requesting refunds. Organizers asked customers not to request refunds on payments they had already disputed through their credit card companies, a move some made almost as soon as they arrived.",
		"16" : "Shivi Kumar, 33, who split a $3,500 deluxe lodge package with six friends, asked her bank to refund the money she had uploaded to a digital wristband, which organizers had recommended that guests use instead of cash.",
		"17" : "“When I called Bank of America, they said, ‘We already know about everything’” regarding the festival, Ms. Kumar said. “They didn’t even do a temporary credit; they just refunded it.”",
		"18" : "The organizers’ email also promised that Mr. McFarland would make a personal apology by phone and asked ticket holders for the best number to use to contact them.",
		"19" : "“We are now one of the world’s most famous festivals,” the note said, “for all the wrong reasons.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Fox News forced out one of its most senior executives on Monday, the latest aftershock of a sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed the television network and pressured its owners, the Murdoch family, into a painful and protracted public housecleaning.",
		"2" : "The exit of Bill Shine — a co-president at the network and a close ally of Roger E. Ailes, its former chairman — came nearly 10 months after Mr. Ailes was removed in the wake of numerous harassment allegations. Mr. Shine’s departure could portend big changes as the Murdochs move to retool a lucrative channel that has threatened to become an obstacle to their global business ambitions.",
		"3" : "Mr. Shine’s exit did little to quell a newsroom in tumult, however. Even as Mr. Shine was removed, another veteran executive with deep ties to Mr. Ailes, Suzanne Scott, was promoted. Ms. Scott, who is now the president of programming, has been cited in lawsuits against the network as a figure who enabled and concealed Mr. Ailes’s behavior.",
		"4" : "Mr. Shine had been viewed by some employees as a symbol of Mr. Ailes’s tainted tenure amid a public pledge by the network’s corporate parent, 21st Century Fox, to reform its office culture. He was accused in several lawsuits of covering up Mr. Ailes’s behavior and dismissing concerns from women who complained about it. Mr. Shine and Ms. Scott deny any wrongdoing.",
		"5" : "Seen by the Murdochs as a steward rather than a visionary — Rupert Murdoch, in a meeting with executives, once referred to him as a “fine company man” — Mr. Shine was not considered a long-term leader for the network, despite his close relationships with marquee personalities like Sean Hannity.",
		"6" : "But Mr. Shine’s standing weakened in recent weeks as his name surfaced in new lawsuits against the channel and some advocacy groups called for his firing. Inside Fox News, Mr. Shine also advocated keeping Bill O’Reilly, even after The New York Times reported that Mr. O’Reilly, a popular prime-time host, had entered into multimillion-dollar settlements with women who had accused him of harassment. Mr. O’Reilly was fired almost two weeks ago.",
		"7" : "The string of major departures — at a network that for two decades had had little to no change in its senior ranks — has unsettled Fox News’s employees, from its prime-time stars to its rank-and-file staff. Mr. Hannity, who had recommended Mr. Shine for his first position at Fox News, said on Twitter last week that Mr. Shine’s removal would be “the total end of the FNC as we know it.”",
		"8" : "Mr. Hannity was mostly silent about the matter on Monday, although he posted a comment on Twitter affirming reports that he was not considering a departure from the network. Though Mr. Hannity teasingly suggested on his show that he might have something to say about Monday’s changes, in the end he did not address Mr. Shine’s exit.",
		"9" : "Mr. Murdoch, Fox News’s executive chairman, is facing pressure on multiple fronts, not least his own corporate aspirations. He is on the verge of acquiring a long-coveted prize, the British satellite and television company Sky, for his European media empire.",
		"10" : "But the deal must be approved by a British regulatory agency that will determine if 21st Century Fox can act as a “fit and proper” owner. The last time that Mr. Murdoch faced a major public outcry — during the hacking scandal at his British tabloid News of the World — he was stymied by regulators, who rejected an attempt to acquire Sky.",
		"11" : "The Murdochs are “definitely cleaning house,” said Andrew Gilman, the chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group.",
		"12" : "Referring to Mr. Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, who run 21st Century Fox, Mr. Gilman added, “It sounds like the younger Murdochs are saying, ‘We’re willing to sacrifice some revenue and talent for a longer-term view.’”",
		"13" : "The family has been willing to make sacrifices before: News of the World no longer publishes, and Rupert Murdoch let go one of his favorite executives, Rebekah Brooks, when she was caught up in that scandal (although he has since hired her back). Whether the Murdochs go further in changing over Fox News’s leadership is now a source of open speculation at the network.",
		"14" : "With Mr. Shine out, the network is now under the day-to-day command of Jack Abernethy, who retained a title of co-president. Mr. Abernethy has also been cited as contributing to a toxic environment at Fox News. He has denied wrongdoing.",
		"15" : "The network’s senior ranks still include other executives who worked closely with Mr. Ailes, including Dianne Brandi, the general counsel. On Monday, several employees pointed to the continued power of Mr. Abernethy, Ms. Brandi and Ms. Scott as evidence that the old guard at Fox News remains in charge.",
		"16" : "Two employees invoked a phrase from President Trump in describing the attitude of some workers: “Drain the swamp.”",
		"17" : "Five current Fox News employees, male and female, described the newsroom on Monday as being in a state of shock after learning of Mr. Shine’s exit. Workers there, speaking anonymously because they feared retribution, described a sense of continuing dread about the spate of new developments in a scandal that has stretched on for months.",
		"18" : "Mr. Shine was a Long Island commuter who prided himself on his working-class roots, and friends considered him the newsroom’s closest embodiment of the average Fox News viewer. He had a knack for talent management and maintained a close friendship with Mr. Hannity, with whom he had worked before Mr. Hannity made the leap to cable-news prominence. The men frequently spoke by telephone.",
		"19" : "It was Mr. Murdoch who selected Mr. Shine as a co-president last summer, after Mr. Ailes’s removal, and it was Mr. Murdoch who on Monday announced Mr. Shine’s exit in a memo to the staff.",
		"20" : "“I know Bill was respected and liked by everyone at Fox News,” Mr. Murdoch wrote. “We will all miss him.”",
		"21" : "In a subsequent public statement, Mr. Murdoch praised Mr. Shine even more, writing, “His contribution to our channel and our country will resonate for many years.”",
		"22" : "Mr. Shine’s co-president position is considered open. Another executive, Jay Wallace, was promoted to president for news.",
		"23" : "Mr. Murdoch concluded his note by underscoring the lucrative nature of the network. “Fox News continues to break both viewing and revenue records, for which I thank you all,” he wrote, adding, “I am sure we can do even better.”"

The filing did not elaborate on why she believed the column led to her being barred other than noting that it happened three days after the article was published and that she previously had received positive performance evaluations.",

		"6" : "Ms. Falzone’s claim is the latest of many the network has faced since its former chief, Roger Ailes, was forced out last summer after being accused by at least six women of inappropriate behavior.

		"5" : "Setting up what promises to be one of the most intriguing battles in television, an NBC spokeswoman said Monday that Megyn Kelly’s new daytime talk show would go up against Ms. Ripa and Mr. Seacrest. Cue the Kelly-versus-Kelly tabloid headlines.",
		"6" : "Ms. Kelly joined NBC in January after a successful ratings run at Fox News.",
		"7" : "“It’s always interesting to me when people try to pit us against other shows,” Ms. Ripa said, brushing aside a question about increased competition. “We don’t compare ourselves to anybody because we are the only ones who do what we do.”",
		"8" : "Mr. Seacrest joins Ms. Ripa one year after her previous “Live” co-host, Michael Strahan, abruptly left for a job at “Good Morning America” on ABC. It was a badly bungled transition: Ms. Ripa felt blindsided by Mr. Strahan’s negotiations with ABC, which were kept secret until the last minute, and she saw ABC as slighting her show in favor of another. She did not come to work for three days while ABC did damage control. (“Live” is produced and distributed by Disney-ABC syndication.)",
		"9" : "But Ms. Ripa, who recently signed a new multiyear contract, said she had moved on from that drama. “Whatever brought us to here was worth it 1,000 times over,” she said. “This is a great, great moment.”",
		"10" : "At the start of Monday’s show, Ms. Ripa and Mr. Seacrest walked on stage holding hands.",
		"11" : "“Nice to see you, partner,” he said.",
		"12" : "“Hi, partner,” she responded, giving him a noisy kiss on the cheek.",
		"13" : "Then they discussed her weekend flu and his mother’s texting vocabulary, and he read from a list of first-day dos and don’ts. “I’m a little bit nervous,” he said.",
		"14" : "“Live,” with its celebrity chitchat, home viewer trivia segment and occasional burst of confetti, has been a brightly lit national television institution since 1988, when Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford held the coffee mugs. Little about the bouncy show will change with Mr. Seacrest’s arrival, at least at first. “Live,” after all, still wins its time period, attracting an average of 3.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen.",
		"15" : "“We welcome Ryan’s energy, enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit and look forward to all the possibilities that the future holds,” Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, said in a statement.",
		"16" : "“Live With Kelly and Ryan,” as the syndicated series will now be called, represents an important career moment for Mr. Seacrest. The program returns him to regular broadcast television a year after the end of “American Idol,” which he hosted on Fox for 15 seasons. A successful run on “Live” could give a boost to Mr. Seacrest’s personal businesses, which include a clothing line, Ryan Seacrest Distinction, and a coming skin care line. (The show also brings him another rich payday. Terms of his multiyear contract were not disclosed, but it is easily worth millions of dollars annually.)",
		"17" : "For ABC, which has pursued Mr. Seacrest for years, landing him required a herculean behind-the-scenes effort to rearrange his Rubik’s Cube of a schedule. Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, was even involved, Mr. Seacrest said.",
		"18" : "Consider, for instance, Mr. Seacrest’s Los Angeles radio show, “On Air With Ryan Seacrest,” which iHeartRadio broadcasts on weekday mornings from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific time. It will continue in its present form. But he will now work from a New York recording studio instead of a California one, at least for most of the year, and some segments during the radio program’s first hour — since it will overlap with “Live” — will be taped.",
		"19" : "“Very few people have both the appeal and the work ethic to accomplish this,” Robert W. Pittman, chief executive of iHeartMedia, said in a statement. “I’m pleased to see him return to another regular TV platform.”",
		"20" : "Mr. Seacrest’s “American Top 40,” a nationally syndicated weekend radio show, will continue. So will his hosting duties for iHeart events and his affiliation with NBCUniversal’s E channel. Mr. Seacrest hosts red-carpet specials for E, and his Los Angeles-based production company supplies the network with reality shows like “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” Among his other commitments: hosting “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” for ABC, maintaining endorsement deals with Coca-Cola and Ford, and various philanthropic and nonprofit pursuits.",
		"21" : "“The puzzle of it all is what took a long time to figure out,” Mr. Seacrest said of the negotiations with ABC. “I love to do a lot, but I am very conscious of making sure that no commitment is less favorite than another. They all deserve full focus, full attention, full energy.”",
		"22" : "In many ways, Mr. Seacrest and Ms. Ripa are mirror images. They have a peppy polish, teacup physiques and an ability — harder than it looks — to engage celebrities in entertaining conversation. They first got to know each other more than a decade ago at Walt Disney World in Florida, where they hosted a Christmas parade telecast.",
		"23" : "Who would land the “Live” hosting job had been a topic of hot speculation for the celebrity news media over the last year. Anderson Cooper? Mario Lopez? For Ms. Ripa, who had approval over who would sit beside her on “Live,” Mr. Seacrest got the job the day in November when he appeared on the show as her guest co-host and did an awkward cooking segment with his mother, Connie. (They made oyster casserole.)",
		"24" : "“It’s like he didn’t even know what a kitchen is,” Ms. Ripa said. “And I thought: ‘Did we finally find a flaw in this person? Innnteresting.’”"

		"1" : "The last thing Joel Malizia, a co-founder of the video production company Pilot Moon Films, expected when he arrived at the airport in Austin, Tex., for the recent South by Southwest festival was the sound of live music.",
		"2" : "What he heard was the ensemble of Wendy Colonna, who describes her musical style as Americana. “It was so ethereal,” he said.",
		"3" : "Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is among over a half-dozen airports in the United States that offer travelers frazzled by bottlenecks on security lines and cramped seating on planes (not to mention pressured airport employees) a bit of a respite in the form of music.",
		"4" : "Ms. Colonna said that her group played at the airport about four times a year as part of the airport’s Music in the Air program. “We don’t have to go on the road to make new fans,” she said. “At the airport, the road comes to us.”",
		"5" : "For much of the year, several musical groups perform weekly, but during South by Southwest in March, that number swelled to more than 20, said Michael Pennock, the music coordinator for the city’s aviation department.",
		"6" : "The city aviation department; Delaware North Companies, a food service and hospitality company based in Buffalo; and Pepsi underwrite the program. The musicians are paid $120 for two 50-minute sets on four smaller stages or $100 per musician for up to five musicians on a main stage on the secure side of the airport.",
		"7" : "For a similar program at Nashville International Airport, Music in the Terminal, 80 to 100 bands perform each year on four stages. Last year, Pittsburgh International Airport began hosting two performances a month in the baggage claim area. Houston Airport System created a performance series, Harmony in the Air, with rotating soloists, including classical music and jazz, at William P. Hobby Airport beginning in 2015 and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2016. San Diego Airport recently instituted a paid performing arts residency. This year’s winner, TranscenDance, began performances there last month.",
		"8" : "The idea is not a new one: After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Portland International Airport in Oregon began hosting musical performances by volunteer musicians and now has 65 performances a week.",
		"9" : "The airports’ arrangements with musicians vary. Most pay the performers, although rates may depend on experience, the size of the group and even the difficulty of the genre. Funding comes from a combination of sources. An airport authority may join forces with a corporate partner or a state or municipal arts commission. Houston Airport System has an enterprise fund for operations, maintenance and capital improvements.",
		"10" : "While passengers say they appreciate the unexpected interludes, and musicians’ earnings and fan bases may receive a lift from the programs, airports’ decisions to offer performing arts are largely for their own benefit, said Steven A. Carvell, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.",
		"11" : "“Arts are one of the few things an airport authority can do to control the traveler experience,” he said. “They take the traveler out of the space they are in, so they are not attending to their anxiety.”",
		"12" : "A potential for increased profits may also factor into that decision. In airports where entertainment is offered in areas past security lines, the music gives passengers a reason to linger near shops and food and beverage concessions, and to make purchases.",
		"13" : "A report released in March by the Airports Council International-North America, a group in Washington representing airport owners and aviation-related businesses, said that airports estimated they would need almost $100 billion for capital projects over the next five years. Right now, they can fund only about half that on their own.",
		"14" : "“Music provides a better passenger experience and encourages people to arrive earlier,” said Darren Perry, a managing director in the aviation and travel practice at L.E.K. Consulting. “The earlier they arrive, the more money they spend. The money could be used for any number of things, from improving the facilities to making the facilities more comfortable.”",
		"15" : "Some passengers, like Donna Seymour, an assistant vice president and account executive at a title insurance company who lives in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., agree. Ms. Seymour said that hearing a blues guitarist when she arrived at the Nashville International Airport recently “set the mood for the trip.”",
		"16" : "And a performance may reach listeners beyond its in-person audience. Sharjeel Ahsan, a certified public accountant in Houston who said he traveled about six times a year for business, was walking through Hobby Airport in February when he heard strains of classical music.",
		"17" : "Before getting something to eat and continuing to his gate, he stopped for about 15 minutes to hear the Apollo Chamber Players. He recorded the segment on his phone and still listens to it. Later, he said, he told his colleagues about his encounter.",
		"18" : "Matthew J. Detrick, a violinist and artistic director for the Apollo Chamber Players, said that the airport gig had helped improve the group’s performances. “It teaches us to break down barriers between audience and performer,” he said.",
		"19" : "Maricela Kruseman, the performing arts program manager for the Houston Airport System who books talent, said that the audition process was competitive. Musicians are expected to have a college degree in music, five years of experience, two professional and two personal references, and must be performing in Houston. (Currently 10 groups perform at two Houston airports.) Other airports have their own criteria; a common requirement is for musicians to reside and have performing experience in a specific city.",
		"20" : "Ms. Kruseman said that she had recently moved some of the performances at Bush Intercontinental to Terminal D, where passengers are expected to arrive three hours ahead for international flights. Concerts are scheduled to lead up to afternoon departures.",
		"21" : "For all its entertainment value, music can only go so far in easing passengers’ stress. Barbara E. Lichman, a lawyer specializing in aviation at Buchalter, a law firm in Irvine, Calif., said that the airlines and the Transportation Security Administration needed to closely examine their contributions to travelers’ anxiety. She pointed to cramped and overcrowded airplanes and what she considered illogical parameters for T.S.A. searches.",
		"22" : "“Fix the problems in the industry and don’t coat them over with icing like music,” she said.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "For a brief moment, Wall Street stopped on Monday, as if time was suspended in an alternative reality.",
		"2" : "President Trump, for the first time as resident of the White House, said aloud that he was considering breaking up the nation’s biggest banks. Of course, he had said it on the campaign trail, but this seemed different.",
		"3" : "“I’m looking at that right now,” Mr. Trump told Bloomberg News during an interview in the Oval Office. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.”",
		"4" : "The headline ricocheted around the email boxes of senior bank executives across the industry. At the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles, where Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had just finished speaking — and didn’t mention breaking up the banks — the hallways quickly buzzed about the comment, according to participants, as their phones lit up. Shares of bank stocks dived lower within seconds of the headline, only to recover quickly.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump’s comments shouldn’t come as a surprise: His chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn — formerly president of Goldman Sachs — has been not-so-quietly trying to socialize the idea of bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that was enacted to prevent investment and commercial banks from combining. The law was repealed in 1999, helping to bring about the supersized banking giants that dominate the market today.",
		"6" : "Before Monday’s musings, Mr. Trump’s thoughts on the matter had felt like a theoretical exercise, those who have met with him say.",
		"7" : "What would be surprising, however, is if Mr. Trump made it a reality. It would be one thing for him to “do a big number” on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law that imposed stricter regulations on banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis — he has repeatedly stated that he wants to pare it back, repealing parts of the law. But it would be a much more seismic shift to bring back Glass-Steagall, which would be the equivalent of doing “a big number” on the banks themselves. The biggest names in banking would presumably face the choice of having to shed either their commercial banking arm or their investment banking division.",
		"8" : "When Mr. Trump met with business executives in February at the White House, he turned to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, an unabashed defender of big banks, for advice. JPMorgan Chase would not exist in its current form were it not for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall.",
		"9" : "“There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it,” Mr. Trump said at the time, to the consternation of proponents of more banking regulation.",
		"10" : "Viewed through the prism of goosing the economy and creating jobs — as Mr. Trump has pledged his efforts should be viewed — it’s hard to see how breaking up the biggest banks would help, especially in the short term. Indeed, it would most likely have the opposite effect.",
		"11" : "Mr. Trump’s chief complaint about Wall Street is that he doesn’t think lenders are extending enough money. “I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses. They can’t borrow money,” he famously said. “They just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.”",
		"12" : "Given that commercial lending is at a record, according to the Federal Reserve, that’s a hard statement to square.",
		"13" : "But let’s be generous and assume for a moment that he is right. What is undoubtedly true is that big banks would probably be even more conservative with their loan books during whatever transition would be required to comply with a new version of Glass-Steagall. Such a law would inject as much uncertainty into the economy as Dodd-Frank did initially, when banks were sorting out how they would comply. The process did throw some big banks’ lending into a state of paralysis.",
		"14" : "And while proponents of ending too-big-to-fail love to point to the repeal of Glass-Steagall as the culprit, by now that meme should have resolved itself.",
		"15" : "“I don’t think that Glass-Steagall was a cause of the crisis,” Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who has no horse in this race, told me matter-of-factly.",
		"16" : "Indeed, he said, he would be worried if the law were brought back, because it would hamstring the government if it ever needed to intervene in a crisis similar to what happened in 2008. “If Glass-Steagall had been in effect, we couldn’t have had some of the failing firms taken over,” Mr. Bernanke said. “JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns, and so on.”",
		"17" : "On the other hand, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve and a former Treasury staff member who oversaw the bailouts of the banks, has been on a campaign to break up the biggest banks, concerned that they still pose too much of a risk to taxpayers if they were to fail.",
		"18" : "Mr. Trump’s comments came on the same day that he and his team spoke with about 100 community bankers led by Cam Fine, president and chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America. One issue they discussed was the idea of a two-tiered system of regulations, one for big banks and another for community banks. Whether that construct is now being interpreted as a new version of Glass-Steagall or a breakup of the banks remains an open question.",
		"19" : "But let’s be clear: If Mr. Trump were to try to bring back what he described on the campaign trail as Glass-Steagall, it wouldn’t be to prevent the next crisis. He would have to be convinced that bringing back the law would stoke the economy. And that’s an even scarier prospect, because it means firms like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which have been forced to reduce the risk they take, would ultimately be less regulated.",
		"20" : "There are a lot of good reasons to reform Dodd-Frank. And there are lots of good ways to make regulations less onerous to the nation’s smaller banks, which complain they are drowning in legal and compliance bills; giving them some relief could indeed open the loan spigot even more. But both of those measures would be very different from bringing back Glass-Steagall.",
		"21" : "Whether Mr. Trump’s talk translates into action on this front remains to be seen. The prevailing view seems to be: “Be prepared for more headline risk for big banks as lawmakers keep piling on the anti-Wall Street rhetoric — most of it will be substantively meaningless,” according to Ian Katz of Capital Alpha, whose comments were highlighted by Ben White of Politico.",
		"22" : "Of course, with President Trump, the prevailing view could change in an instant."

		"2" : "Each of us has a unique “odorprint” made up of thousands of organic compounds. These molecules offer a whiff of who we are, revealing age, genetics, lifestyle, hometown — even metabolic processes that underlie our health.",
		"3" : "Ancient Greek and Chinese medical practitioners used a patient’s scent to make diagnoses. Modern medical research, too, confirms that the smell of someone’s skin, breath and bodily fluids can be suggestive of illness. The breath of diabetics sometimes smells of rotten apples, experts report; the skin of typhoid patients, like baking bread.",
		"4" : "But not every physician’s nose is a precision instrument, and dogs, while adept at sniffing out cancer, get distracted. So researchers have been trying for decades to figure out how to build an inexpensive odor sensor for quick, reliable and noninvasive diagnoses.",
		"5" : "The field finally seems on the cusp of succeeding.",
		"6" : "“You’re seeing a convergence of technology now, so we can actually run large-scale clinical studies to get the data to prove odor analysis has real utility,” said Billy Boyle, co-founder and president of operations at Owlstone, a manufacturer of chemical sensors in Cambridge, England.",
		"7" : "Mr. Boyle, an electronics engineer, formed the company with two friends in 2004 to develop sensors to detect chemical weapons and explosives for customers, including the United States government. But when Mr. Boyle’s girlfriend and eventual wife, Kate Gross, was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2012, his focus shifted to medical sensors, with an emphasis on cancer detection.",
		"8" : "Ms. Gross died at the end of 2014. That she might still be alive if her cancer had been detected earlier, Mr. Boyle said, continues to be a “big motivator.”",
		"9" : "Owlstone has raised $23.5 million to put its odor analysis technology into the hands of clinicians. Moreover, Britain’s National Health Service is funding a 3,000-subject clinical trial to test Owlstone’s sensor to diagnose lung cancer.",
		"10" : "The sensor is a silicon chip stacked with various metal layers and tiny gold electrodes. While it looks like your mobile phone’s SIM card, it works like a chemical filter.",
		"11" : "The molecules in an odor sample are first ionized — given a charge — and then an electric current is used to move only chemicals of diagnostic interest through the channels etched in the chip, where they can be detected.",
		"12" : "“You can program what you want to sniff out just by changing the software,” Mr. Boyle said. “We can use the device for our own trials on colorectal cancer, but it can also be used by our partners to look for other things, like irritable bowel disease.”",
		"13" : "The company also is conducting a 1,400-subject trial, in collaboration with the University of Warwick, to detect colon cancer from urine samples, and is exploring whether its chips can help determine the best drugs for asthma patients by sorting through molecules in their breath.",
		"14" : "A similar diagnostic technology is being developed by an Israeli chemical engineer, Hossam Haick, who was also touched by cancer.",
		"15" : "“My college roommate had leukemia, and it made me want to see whether a sensor could be used for treatment,” said Mr. Haick, a professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. “But then I realized early diagnosis could be as important as treatment itself.”",
		"16" : "His smelling machine uses an array of sensors composed of gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. They are coated with ligands, molecular receptors that have a high affinity for certain biomarkers of disease found in exhaled breath.",
		"17" : "Once these biomarkers latch onto the ligands, the nanoparticles and nanotubes swell or shrink, changing how long it takes for an electrical charge to pass between them. This gain or loss in conductivity is translated into a diagnosis.",
		"18" : "“We send all the signals to a computer, and it will translate the odor into a signature that connects it to the disease we exposed to it,” Mr. Haick said.",
		"19" : "With artificial intelligence, he said, the machine becomes better at diagnosing with each exposure. Rather than detecting specific molecules that suggest disease, however, Mr. Haick’s machine sniffs out the overall chemical stew that makes up an odor.",
		"20" : "It’s analogous to smelling an orange: Your brain doesn’t distinguish among the chemicals that make up that odor. Instead, you smell the totality, and your brain recognizes all of it as an orange.",
		"21" : "Mr. Haick and his colleagues published a paper in ACS Nano last December showing that his artificially intelligent nanoarray could distinguish among 17 different diseases with up to 86 percent accuracy.",
		"22" : "There were a total of 1,404 participants in the trial, but the sample sizes for each disease were quite small. And the machine was better at distinguishing among some diseases than others.",
		"23" : "In the United States, a team of researchers from the Monell Chemical Senses Center and the University of Pennsylvania received an $815,000 grant in February from the Kleburg Foundation to advance work on a prototype odor sensor that detects ovarian cancer in samples of blood plasma.",
		"24" : "The team chose plasma because it is somewhat less likely than breath or urine to be corrupted by confounding factors like diet or environmental chemicals, including cleaning products or pollution.",
		"25" : "Instead of ligands, their sensors rely on snippets of single-strand DNA to do the work of latching onto odor particles.",
		"26" : "“We are trying to make the device work the way we understand mammalian olfaction works,” said Charlie Johnson, director of the Nano/Bio Interface Center at the University of Pennsylvania, who is leading the fabrication effort. “DNA gives unique characteristics for this process.”",
		"27" : "In addition to these groups, teams in Austria, Switzerland and Japan also are developing odor sensors to diagnose disease.",
		"28" : "“I think the fact that you’re seeing so much activity both in commercial and academic settings shows that we’re getting a lot closer,” said Cristina Davis, a biomedical engineer and professor at the University of California, Davis, who also is helping to develop an odor sensor to diagnose disease.",
		"29" : "“My estimate is it’s a three- to five-year time frame” before such tools are available to clinicians, she added.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "PAULISTA, Brazil — On the bed next to her brother, Ana Vitória da Silva Araújo acted like the 1-year-old she was. She smiled and babbled. She played with a stuffed whale. She plucked the pacifier from her brother’s mouth and the burp cloth from his shoulder.",
		"2" : "Her brother, João Lucas, seemed unaware of her, his eyes closed, his mouth making sucking motions. It was typical behavior for a newborn. But João Lucas is the exact same age as Ana Vitória — they are twins.",
		"3" : "João Lucas was born with microcephaly and other serious problems, the result of his mother being bitten by a Zika infected mosquito during pregnancy. But the virus that attacked his brain in the womb apparently spared his sister.",
		"4" : "The siblings are one of nine sets of twins identified in Brazil’s Zika crisis, and scientists hope they can shed light on how the virus works generally and why it inflicts ruthless damage on some babies and not others.",
		"5" : "Twins often yield clues to medical mysteries because their biological similarities allow scientists to identify relevant differences. Determining why one twin became infected in the womb while the other did not may illuminate how Zika crosses the placenta, how it enters the brain, and whether any genetic mutations make a fetus more resistant or susceptible to Zika infection.",
		"6" : "Until recently, Brazil’s Zika twins seemed to follow a pattern, said Mayana Zatz, a geneticist and molecular biologist at the University of São Paulo. The cases include two sets of identical twins, and both babies in each pair have microcephaly, she said. There are also six sets of fraternal twins, in which one twin has microcephaly, while the other appears unaffected.",
		"7" : "Since identical twins share one placenta while fraternal twins almost always have separate placentas, Dr. Zatz and other experts suggested that the Zika virus may have penetrated one placenta and not the other.",
		"8" : "Perhaps the virus entered through a weak spot in one placenta’s membrane, said Dr. Ernesto Marques, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pittsburgh and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Recife, Brazil. Or if one fetus “kicked the placenta,” he said, inflammation from that bruise on the membrane could become a portal.",
		"9" : "But one set of twins has broken the pattern. Those twins are fraternal and had separate placentas — but both have microcephaly and other Zika complications. “The boy is more affected than the girl, but both are severe,” Dr. Zatz said.",
		"10" : "That case complicates the theory. Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, who helped discover that Zika causes microcephaly and has treated some of the twins, said one explanation might be that in some fraternal cases Zika crossed both placentas, but the twins had genetic differences that influenced why only one became infected or “why the babies reacted differently to the virus.”",
		"11" : "Dr. Marques suggested another possibility: that an impaired twin was exposed to Zika before the mother’s body or the placenta developed immune responses against the virus and that the second fetus was infected slightly later.",
		"12" : "“It should reach both at an equal time,” he said. “However, if the virus hit one of the babies before the mother actually had developed protective immune responses, you have a problem.”",
		"13" : "Dr. Zatz’s lab has drawn blood from affected and unaffected twins, and is growing brain cells from their stem cells. She is testing to see which of those cells are susceptible to Zika infection. That could show whether some twins have genetic predispositions that make Zika infection more likely. Ultimately, Dr. Zatz expects to find an interplay of factors that can vary in each twin pregnancy. “I believe,” she said, “the explanation will be complex.”",
		"14" : "For now, why João Lucas is devastated by the virus and his sister is not remains a mystery.",
		"15" : "When João Lucas and his twin sister were born in August 2015, their mother, Neide Maria Ferreira da Silva, was unaware he had microcephaly or brain damage, she said. He was born first and was temporarily placed in an oxygen chamber because of breathing problems. And the maternity hospital’s “deformation doctor,” a physician specializing in newborns with deficiencies, recommended he see a geneticist. But Ms. da Silva thought any problems would be mild, she said.",
		"16" : "She had already given birth to 10 children, starting when she was 17. It took a month before she brought João Lucas to the geneticist, who said “his brain, it wasn’t like ours,” Ms. da Silva, 42, recalled. “It was going to be always very small.”",
		"17" : "She was shocked. “I didn’t feel sad or upset,” she said. “I thought about how it was going to be when he grows up” and realized “I will have to take care of him more than the other kids.”",
		"18" : "But his symptoms began overwhelming her. “He would fall asleep, and five minutes later he would start screaming,” she said.",
		"19" : "Ms. da Silva was especially alarmed by João Lucas’s seizures, which made him “get purple” and look “like his eyes were going to jump out.”",
		"20" : "Sometimes he became so agitated, he would scratch himself in the face, Ms. da Silva said. “Blood would come out.”",
		"21" : "Unable to cope with his care, Ms. da Silva started bringing him to a neighbor’s cousin, who began caring for him. The caregiver, Valéria Gomes Ribeiro, 46, brought the baby to his first appointment with a neurologist. The doctor prescribed clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug, to calm him, but Ms. Ferreira still found that when João Lucas was home, something often went wrong. He developed pneumonia and eating problems, even what she called “an emotional fever” because he seemed to miss Ms. Ribeiro, Ms. da Silva said.",
		"22" : "Ms. da Silva’s 11-year-old daughter became pregnant and had an abortion, prompting a child protection agency visit. After Ms. da Silva told the caseworker that a friend was caring for her Zika baby, the agency investigated and initiated proceedings to remove João Lucas from her home. To keep him from being placed in a shelter, both women and the state agreed that João Lucas would live with Ms. Ribeiro, while Ana Vitória stayed with Ms. da Silva. Under court order, João Lucas spends Sundays at his biological mother’s house.",
		"23" : "Ms. Ribeiro, who has adorned João Lucas with a bracelet and necklace hung with a good-luck charm called a “figa,” tries to keep up with his many appointments. They include visits with a psychologist who shows João Lucas a panel of black and white squares to stimulate vision and rubs him with a sponge studded with Popsicle sticks to stimulate touch.",
		"24" : "On a visit last fall to Ms. Ribeiro’s emerald green house on a dirt street, where the 23rd psalm hangs on a yellow wall, Ana Vitória toddled around, clutching a piece of spongy cake with one hand, thumping a table with the other. Reaching for her brother’s mouth, she touched the green tape that therapists apply around his lips, fingers, back and chin to relax tight muscles. Ms. da Silva waved a rattle before João Lucas, but he did not respond.",
		"25" : "So far, his sister — like the other fraternal twins without obvious brain damage — appears unimpaired, but doctors are monitoring her and the others. At Ana Vitória’s one-year exam, she was slightly behind developmentally. Her vocabulary was limited and she was slow to point to her mother when the doctor asked, Ms. da Silva said.",
		"26" : "That could be unrelated to Zika, but, she noted, “The doctor never said it’s 100 percent sure that she doesn’t have a problem.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Facing a chronic problem of raw sewage emptying into city waterways during rainfalls, and struggling to meet health regulations, New York City environmental officials are turning to a new method of treating bacteria in sewage: dumping chlorine into sewer pipes leading to the waterways.",
		"2" : "The city’s Department of Environmental Protection has long tried to mitigate the pollution and health risks from the estimated 20 billion gallons per year of untreated sewage that flow into city waterways when treatment systems are overwhelmed during a rainfall.",
		"3" : "In recent years, the city has promoted projects like new retention tanks and has planted patches of greenery to lessen the runoff during rainstorms.",
		"4" : "But some environmental advocates claim that details have been scant on the city’s plan to disinfect wastewater by chlorinating it inside pipes just before the waste discharges into three bodies of water in Queens and the Bronx.",
		"5" : "“They’re using the most worrisome and unproven technique that we have in our toolbox,” said Sean Dixon, a staff lawyer at Riverkeeper, a group that seeks to protect the Hudson River and its tributaries. “It’s like they’re grabbing the last straw and using the cheapest and least effective method.”",
		"6" : "In response to this and other water-quality concerns, a coalition of local environmental groups announced recently that they intended to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency, saying the agency had not adequately protected water quality in New York City’s waterways under the federal Clean Water Act.",
		"7" : "Federal officials said they would not comment on the allegations and directed questions regarding the chlorination to New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation, which is responsible for enforcing federal regulations and standards that the city must follow.",
		"8" : "The city’s plan includes locations and budgets for chlorination facilities to be built to serve three waterways: Alley Creek and Flushing Creek in Queens and the Hutchinson River in the Bronx.",
		"9" : "Chlorination is commonly done in the more controlled setting of wastewater treatment plants, rather than in sewer pipes flowing directly into waterways.",
		"10" : "Advocates called the chlorination plan, while comparatively small in such a vast sewage system, an unusual initiative that they worry might be expanded to other areas of the city. They cited a separate pilot program that the city has underway to add chlorination to a sewer pipe in Spring Creek, a neighborhood in Brooklyn.",
		"11" : "A spokesman for the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, Ted Timbers, said there were currently no other approved plans that included chlorination in sewer pipes.",
		"12" : "Mr. Timbers said that the chlorination would run from May through October and that the sewage would undergo a dechlorination process before being discharged into the waterways.",
		"13" : "He called chlorine “the most widely used disinfectant for water and wastewater treatment in the U.S.” and said the plan had been discussed with the public at neighborhood meetings.",
		"14" : "And, Mr. Timbers said, “New York Harbor is cleaner and healthier today than it has been in more than a century.”",
		"15" : "Sean Mahar, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, said the state would continue to hold the city’s Department of Environmental Protection accountable “for extensive monitoring” and press it “to routinely report data to the state to ensure compliance with our strict standards to protect public health and the environment.”",
		"16" : "Much of the advocates’ outrage was spurred by plans released last month outlining how the city aimed to address sewer overflow in the years to come.",
		"17" : "Larry Levine, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, faulted the plans for failing to call for major reductions in untreated wastewater outflow, describing it as an example of city and state officials failing to meet federal health standards.",
		"18" : "As the city’s population increases, much of its sewer system remains antiquated, and updating it is complicated and expensive. City officials say the system treats about 1.3 billion gallons of city wastewater on a dry day and can handle twice that amount during moderate rainfall.",
		"19" : "But because most of the city’s 305 square miles are impenetrable surfaces like rooftops, roadways and playgrounds — city officials estimate 72 percent — torrents of runoff rainwater flood storm drains and sewers that also handle output from sinks and bathrooms in homes and businesses.",
		"20" : "When this combination is beyond the capacity that a local treatment plant can handle, the excess bypasses processing plants to avoid backing up the systems and flows untreated into the city’s waterways, often causing pathogen levels to rise.",
		"21" : "The city has managed to drastically improve water quality in recent decades, turning many dismal waterways into spots that are now swimmable and brimming with aquatic life.",
		"22" : "Mr. Timbers said New York City had the largest environmentally sustainable infrastructure program in the country and had invested significant amounts of money to build retention tanks and curbside gardens to reduce runoff into sewers.",
		"23" : "The city has a long-range plan to invest $1.5 billion by 2030 on environmentally sustainable infrastructure and has over the last decade invested more than $10 billion to upgrade wastewater treatment plants and improve water quality. In January, the city agency announced that nitrogen levels had declined in city waterways as a result of $1 billion in upgrades at four wastewater treatment plants.",
		"24" : "The agency also plans on building a 25-million-gallon storage tunnel — estimated to cost at least $1.2 billion — to reduce outflow into Flushing Bay.",
		"25" : "Mr. Dixon, of Riverkeeper, hailed those projects but called some strategies shortsighted, such as the chlorination of sewage in pipes, which he said often failed to completely disinfect the material and did not treat certain toxins in the runoff. In addition, Mr. Dixon said, residual chlorine can devastate marine life and hinder water quality testing.",
		"26" : "Timothy Eaton, a hydrologist at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Queens College, said that while chlorine was an effective disinfectant in controlled settings like swimming pools, using it in outflowing sewer pipes was “a very different ballgame.” Unpredictable and constant changes in the volume of sewage flow can complicate the dechlorination process by creating uncertain dosages and residual chlorine, he said.",
		"27" : "“It’s very difficult to predict the amount of water you’re going to get at any period of time,” he said. “If you overdose it, you’re basically treating Flushing Creek and Flushing Bay like swimming pools.”",
		"28" : "The chlorination plan would not remove floating debris or prevent oxygen depletion in the outflow, said Mr. Eaton, who with another hydrologist at the school, Gregory O’Mullan, has spoken out against the chlorination.",
		"29" : "Mr. O’Mullan called it a “Band-Aid” treatment that gives the chlorine limited contact time to disinfect.",
		"30" : "“This is low-level treatment,” he said, adding that it was the kind of approach that would have been used decades ago."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "For months, protesters hounded Mayor Bill de Blasio at town hall-style meetings and fund-raisers from Manhattan to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., demanding that he shut down New York City’s main jail complex on Rikers Island.",
		"2" : "Eventually, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, embraced their cause, and recently called for its closing — a shift that did not go unnoticed by liberal activists.",
		"3" : "Some advocates who have long complained that Mr. de Blasio’s administration has not built enough low-income housing are now looking to follow a similar model with a campaign targeting their bête noire: the deputy mayor in charge of housing and economic development, Alicia K. Glen.",
		"4" : "The strategy involves trying to paint the housing plan with the broad brush of anti-Wall Street sentiment. They have pledged to protest Ms. Glen at public appearances and rally against her housing agenda on the steps of City Hall. They are emphasizing similarities between the mayor’s approach to housing and Ms. Glen’s projects at Goldman Sachs, where she led the firm’s urban investment group, financing affordable housing and other projects, before joining the de Blasio administration in 2014.",
		"5" : "The goal is to force Mr. de Blasio to shift course on his 10-year housing plan, which is on pace to create 200,000 units of new housing for low- to moderate-income residents across New York. Instead, advocates want the city to redirect funds toward building new homes for only the poorest New Yorkers, to stave off gentrification and, they hope, to help reduce homelessness.",
		"6" : "The tactic of sustained and targeted protest is certainly not new. In this administration alone, police officers protested Mr. de Blasio outside Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, and the Prospect Park YMCA, where he works out. And demonstrators set up shop at the home of Steven Banks, the city’s top homelessness official. Their effectiveness is open to debate: Patrol officers got a new contract, though the mayor’s shelter plan is more assertive, not less.",
		"7" : "But no election-year incumbent wants a story line muddled by angry bands of roving protesters. That applies even to Mr. de Blasio, who enjoys a wide lead in polls against his likely opponents.",
		"8" : "“The mayor is going to be re-elected; let’s be real here,” said Bertha Lewis, a former supporter of Mr. de Blasio’s who has become one of his most vocal critics. “So our job is to push as hard to challenge him, not just go along to get along.”",
		"9" : "Many of the same groups that are pressing Mr. de Blasio on the issue of housing, like the organization Ms. Lewis founded, the Black Institute, and New York Communities for Change, have also criticized his approach to policing, another issue resonant with the mayor’s minority supporters. They are looking to the tactics employed in the Rikers campaign by Glenn Martin of JustLeadershipUSA and others who protested the mayor on some of the same social justice issues.",
		"10" : "In addition to protests, Mr. Martin said, his group engaged in “power mapping” the mayor — identifying roughly 1,500 people most important to him and targeting them with digital messages — so that Mr. de Blasio would feel surrounded by its campaign. “We logged 20,000 tweets to the mayor in one day alone,” Mr. Martin said.",
		"11" : "The housing advocates — a coalition of groups under the banner Real Affordability for All — are looking to emulate the approach favored by the anti-Rikers protesters. “The mayor would not have changed course without that campaign,” said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change. “The housing stuff and the criminal justice stuff are the two weak spots for the mayor.”",
		"12" : "So far, Mr. de Blasio has not shown enough political weakness for a prominent challenger to emerge from the left. Most of his rivals, both in his own party and among Republicans, have opted for more centrist campaigns to unseat him; the only one to challenge from the left is a police reform advocate, Robert Gangi, 73, a Democrat who has never before held public office or run a political campaign.",
		"13" : "Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the targeted protests had not affected the administration’s policies in any way. “This has been their strategy for more than two years — and it has had zero impact,” she said. “We’re creating and protecting more affordable housing, including more homes for the lowest-income New Yorkers, than at any time since Mayor Koch.”",
		"14" : "Indeed the coalition now attacking Mr. de Blasio’s housing plan has also previously endorsed elements of the mayor’s approach.",
		"15" : "Ms. Grace added, “Resorting to personal attacks means you’ve run out of honest arguments.”",
		"16" : "The new effort does go further in attacking Ms. Glen, accusing her of bringing a Goldman Sachs model of development to City Hall. To buttress the argument, activists compiled a report looking at projects created by three developers — L&M Development Partners, BRP Development Corporation and BFC Partners — that worked with Ms. Glen both before and after she joined the de Blasio administration.",
		"17" : "The projects, the report argues, fuel gentrification and do not provide enough housing for residents who already live in places like East Harlem and Flatbush, Brooklyn.",
		"18" : "The companies disputed the notion that they received special treatment during Mr. de Blasio’s tenure or that they ignored community demands. “We work on the ground with communities to build what they tell us is appropriate,” Ron Moelis, the chief executive of L&M, said in a statement. “Our city needs affordable homes across a wide economic spectrum, and we do our best to respond.”",
		"19" : "The report compares several projects by the de Blasio administration to the Aspen, an early Bloomberg-era development and venture between Ms. Glen and L&M that included half market-rate apartments, and half that were affordable units at either 50 or 130 percent of the city’s so-called area median income (currently about $86,000 for a family of three).",
		"20" : "Among those singled out is the Bedford-Union Armory project, a redevelopment on public land by BFC Partners that includes half market-rate apartments and also a recreational center. The project has been criticized by some local elected officials who, along with advocates, have called for the entire project to be affordable units.",
		"21" : "The city has said the market-rate units in the armory project are necessary to offset the cost of the recreational center. And officials disagreed with the idea that affordable housing projects exacerbate gentrification.",
		"22" : "“There’s no real evidence or research to back that up,” said James Patchett, president of the city’s Economic Development Corporation and Ms. Glen’s former chief of staff, who also worked at Goldman Sachs. “I don’t believe that a 50 percent affordable project is ever bad. I fundamentally reject that.”",
		"23" : "Those pushing the protest strategy say that it has already been effective for them — a notion that the city disputes.",
		"24" : "The mayor announced in February that he would add $1.9 billion more in city subsidies to include 10,000 more affordable units for New Yorkers earning less than $40,000 a year, bringing the total number of such units in the plan to 50,000 — one quarter of the 200,000 total. The city is now set to spend about $10 billion in subsidies on the overall housing plan, city officials said.",
		"25" : "Yet not all advocates of more affordable housing are on board with personalizing the campaign for more low-income housing.",
		"26" : "Javier H. Valdés of Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights and social justice organization, said that Mr. Westin had approached him about joining the campaign against Ms. Glen and he declined.",
		"27" : "“It has not been our fight,” he said. “I think the mandate comes from the mayor and that’s who needs to set the tone.”"

		"1" : "The New York Mets were leading the Philadelphia Phillies, 2-1, after two innings when Tom McDonald stood up from his upper-deck seat at Citi Field.",
		"2" : "Nature was calling, and so was his obligation to his childhood friend and fellow Mets fan Roy Riegel, whose death nine years ago left Mr. McDonald, 56, vowing to honor their baseball bonds in an unconventional way: by disposing of Mr. Riegel’s ashes in ballparks across the country.",
		"3" : "Even more unusual was his chosen method: flushing them down public restroom toilets in the ballparks between innings.",
		"4" : "“The game has to be in progress — that’s a rule of mine,” Mr. McDonald said one recent weeknight before entering a Citi Field bathroom, holding a little plastic bottle containing a scoopful of Mr. Riegel’s cremains.",
		"5" : "He stepped into a bathroom stall and sprinkled the ashes into the toilet with as much decorum as the setting allowed. A couple of flushes later and Mr. Riegel’s remains were presumably on a journey through Citi Field’s plumbing.",
		"6" : "“I took care of Roy, and I had to use the facilities myself,” Mr. McDonald said, emerging from the stall with the empty container. “So I figure, you know, kill two birds.”",
		"7" : "“I always flush in between, though,” he added. “That’s another rule of mine.”",
		"8" : "The key here is that Mr. Riegel was a plumber, so how better to honor him than by pumping his essence into the plumbing, Mr. McDonald said, adding that he has flushed Mr. Riegel’s ashes at 16 stadiums so far while keeping journals of his trips.",
		"9" : "“I know people might think it’s weird, and if it were anyone else’s ashes, I’d agree,” he said. “But for Roy, this is the perfect tribute to a plumber and a baseball fan and just a brilliant, wild guy.”",
		"10" : "Mr. McDonald, who also goes by Porky, is a recently retired New York City Transit Authority office worker who has written about 3,000 poems, most of them about baseball, often traveling to ballparks across the country for inspiration.",
		"11" : "With no college education or formal instruction as a writer, he has cultivated an accessible, regular-fan style that owes much to his knockaround childhood in Astoria, Queens, not far from where the Mets play — which, it should be said, is in Flushing.",
		"12" : "Mr. McDonald and Mr. Riegel grew up a block apart and attended countless games together at Shea Stadium, which closed in 2008. As adolescents, they raced jubilantly onto the field when the Mets beat the Cincinnati Reds in Game 5 to win the National League pennant in 1973. They also suffered through many losing seasons.",
		"13" : "A watery send-off had not occurred to Mr. McDonald when he asked Mr. Riegel’s family for a portion of his ashes shortly after his 2008 death. He originally had planned only to scatter them in ballparks and other poignant spots.",
		"14" : "He rubbed the ashes tenderly into the asphalt of the schoolyard at Public School 70 in Astoria, where the two had played pickup baseball, football and roller hockey. He smudged them proudly onto a marker on Lower Broadway commemorating the city’s ticker-tape parade for the Mets after their 1969 World Series victory. He dusted them onto Shea’s original home plate location, which is designated by a marker in Citi Field’s parking lot.",
		"15" : "But scattering the ashes at some stadiums posed problems. Mr. McDonald’s first attempt, at a Pittsburgh Pirates game in 2009 at PNC Park, was met with a gust of wind, recalled Adam Boneker, 46, a friend who has accompanied Mr. McDonald on many of his trips to ballparks to dump the ashes.",
		"16" : "“It was awkward,” Mr. Boneker recalled, adding that they resolved to try it at a Minnesota Twins game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis but, once there, realized that an indoor stadium was not an appropriate setting.",
		"17" : "Afterward, at a nearby Irish pub, a frustrated Mr. McDonald excused himself to use the bathroom. He returned smiling and declared triumphantly, “‘I just took care of Roy,’” Mr. Boneker recalled.",
		"18" : "Mr. McDonald had flushed the ashes in the bathroom.",
		"19" : "“Right there, it hit me,” Mr. McDonald said. “After that, it just took on a life of its own.”",
		"20" : "In the years that followed, he — often with Mr. Boneker — flushed ashes in stadiums in Arizona, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., Toronto, Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore and elsewhere.",
		"21" : "In Cleveland, Mr. Riegel’s ashes were flushed at both Progressive Field and at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, because Mr. Riegel was a devout rocker. In Chicago, Mr. McDonald flushed them at a White Sox game but not at a game of the Cubs, the Mets’ old National League nemesis.",
		"22" : "“It’s funny — not in a joke way — but funny that it was exactly like Roy would have wanted it,’’ Mr. McDonald said.",
		"23" : "Over the years, a wide circle of Mr. McDonald’s friends have gotten updates on the latest disposals.",
		"24" : "“It became kind of an inside joke: What’s the best place for Roy’s ashes?” said Mr. McDonald, whose friendship with Mr. Riegel stretched back to Pack 65 of the Cub Scouts and through adulthood as the fun moved into local bars.",
		"25" : "Mr. Riegel was “a major partyer,” Mr. McDonald said, and “walked that tightrope between genius and insanity.”",
		"26" : "The fast life caught up with him, and he died at age 48 on April 8, 2008, the day of the home opener of the Mets’ final season at Shea. Mr. McDonald attended the game without Mr. Riegel and returned home to find out his friend had died.",
		"27" : "He sat down and wrote “A Final Opener, Indeed,” a poem about how the start of each baseball season would renew their childhood friendship.",
		"28" : "“Each April, we were once again, boys in constant, cool connection,” wrote Mr. McDonald, who will read his poems next month at a symposium at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.",
		"29" : "In Mr. McDonald’s Astoria studio apartment, filled with baseball and other memorabilia, he keeps Mr. Riegel’s remaining ashes in a Planters peanuts can next to a set of World Series highlight videos and Mr. McDonald’s collection of 149 autographs of baseball Hall of Famers.",
		"30" : "For each trip, Mr. McDonald spoons some ashes into an empty Advil bottle from the can, whose exterior is wrapped in old Mets ticket stubs. He said he had enough left for one more tribute, which he plans on doing at Durham Athletic Park, the former minor league ballpark in North Carolina where the 1988 movie “Bull Durham” was filmed.",
		"31" : "Mr. Riegel’s youngest brother, Hank Riegel, of Waterloo, N.Y., called Mr. McDonald’s method of ash scattering appropriate, given his brother’s offbeat outlook on life.",
		"32" : "“He’d be like, ‘Oh, yeah, do that,’” Hank Riegel said. “He would definitely approve of it. Never once did Roy follow the rules.”",
		"33" : "For years, Mr. McDonald consoled himself that at least Mr. Riegel never had to see his beloved Shea Stadium torn down. Only recently did he decide that Citi Field was worthy of Mr. Riegel’s ashes.",
		"34" : "And so it was with a poignant smile that he tossed the empty Advil bottle in the bathroom trash can at Citi Field the other night and returned to his upper-deck seat.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The ferry dreams of Mayor Bill de Blasio seemed impossibly ambitious to many who heard them: In a little more than a year, he wanted to build a fleet of boats and a network of landings to lure thousands of New York commuters onto the water from the streets and subways.",
		"2" : "Veteran ferry operators said it could not be done by Mr. de Blasio’s deadline of this summer, just months before he would stand for re-election. Ferry boats are usually fabricated one or two at a time, and planning and building docks and piers often takes years.",
		"3" : "But on Monday morning, Mr. de Blasio was at Pier 11 near Wall Street to triumphantly greet some of the first commuters to take the new NYC Ferry service. Not only did it begin operations on time, Mr. de Blasio repeatedly said, it was ahead of schedule.",
		"4" : "“How was the ride, man?” the mayor asked several riders. To others, he said: “No traffic, all right!” “Smooth!” and “Exactly on time, fantastic.”",
		"5" : "A mayor’s day could hardly be expected to start on a brighter note than the one sounded by Rob Murphy, 60, a resident of the Rockaways in Queens and a business manager in Manhattan, who rode the 7:30 a.m. ferry to Wall Street. “This is absolutely awesome,” Mr. Murphy said. “It’s the best way to get to work. It’s superexciting, like the first day of school.”",
		"6" : "Not all was smooth sailing. One ferry was pulled from service because of a minor mechanical problem, leading to some delays.",
		"7" : "The Rockaway route, which also has a stop in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, is the first of several new legs of a service that is intended to reach every borough except Staten Island. One of Mr. de Blasio’s most heavily promoted initiatives, the service is coming at a high price to the city — but not to riders.",
		"8" : "The city has pledged more than $325 million to build and operate 20 ferries that will connect 22 landings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The mayor has promised to hold the fare even with that of the subway, $2.75 a ride.",
		"9" : "That is quite a bargain for the hourlong trip to Wall Street from the dock at Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive in a 149-passenger boat equipped with Wi-Fi, bike racks and a concession stand selling snacks and drinks, including draft beer and wine, said Delia Brooks of Belle Harbor, Queens.",
		"10" : "“It’s a good deal,” Ms. Brooks said on Sunday as she admired two of the new ferries with her husband, Keith. “It’s going to make our life much better.”",
		"11" : "Ms. Brooks said she would take the boat to appointments with doctors in Brooklyn and speculated that schoolchildren would ride the ferries on field trips to Manhattan to visit museums and see Broadway shows. Mr. Brooks said he thought the ferry service would also attract more visitors to the Rockaways.",
		"12" : "“A lot of the people from Manhattan, the hipsters, are going to come flying out here now,” he said. “It’s going to revitalize the area. We’re going to need more restaurants.”",
		"13" : "Mr. de Blasio seemed energized by the reception for the ferries. “I’m proud to say that this administration has kept our promise to the people of the Rockaways,” he said on Sunday during a ceremonial ride from Queens to Manhattan aboard the Urban Journey, a new boat.",
		"14" : "“Tomorrow morning, a new era begins in New York City,” he said, referring to the start of service at 5:30 a.m. Monday. “Tomorrow morning, we go back to the water.”",
		"15" : "Mr. de Blasio said the expanded ferry service was intended to provide New Yorkers with another way to get to and from work and could help ease congestion on streets and subways. Wearing a suit but no tie, Mr. de Blasio even took a turn at the helm, steering the boat past Breezy Point before turning the controls over to Councilman Donovan Richards Jr. of Queens, a fellow Democrat.",
		"16" : "“It’s like driving a Fiat,” Mr. de Blasio said. “Very responsive.”",
		"17" : "The Urban Journey, which the mayor said sounded “like a ’70s rock band,” will eventually run on other routes on the East River. Built by Horizon Shipbuilding in Bayou La Batre, Ala., it is one of five ferries that have been delivered. Metal Shark, a shipyard in Louisiana, is building some ferries with deeper hulls and larger engines to manage the rougher waters near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn.",

		"19" : "On the inside, though, the boats have a more grown-up atmosphere, with dark gray seats, work spaces and concessions operated by the New Stand. Andrew Deitchman, the company’s chief executive, said the boats going to the Rockaways might sell sunscreen, flip-flops and Frisbees.",
		"20" : "Now, Mr. de Blasio implied, the onus is on city residents to ride the ferries in numbers sufficient to justify the city’s investment. “If this works as well as we hope, if people ride this, we can go farther,” the mayor said on Sunday, hinting at the possibility of expanding the service beyond current plans.",
		"21" : "Those were encouraging words to Terry MacRae, the chief executive of Hornblower Cruises and Events, the San Francisco-based company that will operate the ferries. “If there’s demand and it’s good service, everyone will rush to take credit and want more of it,” he said.",
		"22" : "Just a year ago, doubts about the city’s ability to create a ferry fleet from scratch seemed rampant. Tom Fox, who formerly ran the Water Taxi service in New York, was one of the skeptics.",
		"23" : "“There was a lot of skepticism, and they proved the skeptics wrong,” Mr. Fox said on Sunday. “When you’re wrong, you’re wrong. I’m looking forward to seeing how they operate the service.”"

		"1" : "Wazina Zondon’s 10th-grade class was playing a game about birth control. The students picked a method while Ms. Zondon left the room. When she came back, she had to guess what it was.",
		"2" : "“Am I a barrier method?” asked Ms. Zondon, a family life and sex education teacher at the Urban Assembly Institute of Math and Science for Young Women in Downtown Brooklyn. “Are hormones involved?”",
		"3" : "After a few more questions, Ms. Zondon guessed correctly: an IUD. Other options included condoms, the birth control patch and abstinence. The students had learned about all of them earlier in the class, including how to use them properly and what, if any, side effects they can cause.",
		"4" : "Ms. Zondon’s class offers something advocates say is all too uncommon in New York City: comprehensive sex education. Since 2011, the Department of Education has required that all middle and high schools teach sex education as part of health class. But the requirement came with little enforcement or oversight and compliance has been spotty.",
		"5" : "A bill before the City Council, backed by Planned Parenthood of New York City and a number of other reproductive health and youth advocacy groups, would create a task force to study whether and how sex education is taught and make recommendations for improvement.",
		"6" : "In 2016, about 43 percent of eighth-graders in New York City had never taken a semester of health class, according to data released by the Department of Education. Nearly all graduating 12th-graders had taken health, but that doesn’t always include sex education, which the department does not track. Moreover, about half of the city’s high school students take health in their junior or senior year, which experts say is far too late to begin learning about healthy sexuality. The average girl in the United States begins dating at 12 and a half years old and the average boy at 13 and a half, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
		"7" : "Many reproductive health advocates say students should learn not just about avoiding sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy, but also about consent, a variety of gender identities and sexual orientations, healthy relationships and making informed decisions about sexual behavior.",
		"8" : "“Any great sexual and health education program should be focused on helping young people identify what their goals are and then how they can advocate for themselves to achieve those goals,” said Louise Langheier, the chief executive of Peer Health Exchange, a program in which college students teach sexual health lessons to high school students around the country.",
		"9" : "Students at the Urban Assembly Institute get sex education every year, starting in the sixth grade with lessons on puberty and anatomy, as well as things like crushes and the emotional changes of adolescence, and continuing in later years with information on sexually transmitted infections and contraception. At all levels, the students learn about having healthy relationships, not just with romantic partners, but with parents and friends, and about different gender identities and sexual orientations. “L.G.B.T. identity is woven in and normalized throughout the entire school year,” Ms. Zondon said.",
		"10" : "The Urban Assembly Institute and about five other schools in the city use the Carrera Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program, which combines sex education with financial literacy lessons, career training and mental and physical health care. A 2002 study found that girls in the program were significantly less likely than other girls to have had sex or gotten pregnant. The program did not have a significant effect on boys’ sexual behavior. More recent evaluations have found higher rates of condom use among student participants compared with other teenagers.",
		"11" : "At other schools in the city, the content of sex education varies widely. The Department of Education offers a free health curriculum that includes lessons on relationships and gender as well as information on condoms and testing for sexually transmitted infections. But schools are not required to use it, and the department does not track what curriculums they use.",

		"13" : "In a recent survey by the Sexuality Education Alliance of New York City, a coalition of teachers, students and health experts, 38 percent of students in grades six through 12 who had received sex education had not learned how to put on a condom. Forty-three percent had not learned about gender identity and 38 percent had not learned about consent.",
		"14" : "“Many schools are overburdened with testing,” said Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo, one of the sponsors of the task force bill, which is expected to come to a vote later this year. Sex education, for which there are no state tests or reporting requirements, can fall by the wayside.",
		"15" : "Additionally, of more than 15,000 instructors who taught health in the city last year, only 153 were licensed in health. (About 12,000 were elementary schoolteachers, who typically teach multiple subjects and are unlikely to be licensed in health.) “If people aren’t educated around the pedagogy of sex education, they can talk in out-of-touch, fatalistic or inaccurate terms,” or shame students for their sexual behavior, said Francisco Ramirez, the vice president for education at Planned Parenthood of New York City.",
		"16" : "School administrators sometimes oppose lessons related to sex. At one middle school, said Mr. Ramirez, an administrator objected to a video describing reproduction shown by visiting instructors from Planned Parenthood. The instructors were not invited back.",
		"17" : "Parents are sometimes initially uncomfortable with lessons on gay, bisexual or transgender identities, said Lindsay Fram, a curriculum development coordinator at the Children’s Aid Society, which administers the Carrera Program. But “mostly people want their young people to have the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions,” Rachael Peters, the New York executive director of Peer Health Exchange, said. In a 2009 survey of registered voters in New York State, 85 percent wanted sex education to be taught in schools.",
		"18" : "The Department of Education does not oppose the creation of a sex education task force, but at a hearing on the task force bill last month, Elizabeth Rose, the deputy chancellor for operations, questioned whether it would be possible to review how sex education is taught at all of the city’s more than 1,500 schools, and argued that the task force should not be charged with examining the department’s health curriculum.",
		"19" : "Councilwoman Cumbo, however, said the task force would provide a much-needed “extra set of eyes” on sex education in the city. She is optimistic that the bill will pass.",
		"20" : "“My goal is to continue to do this work until H.I.V. and AIDS and healthy relationships and reproductive health are taken as seriously as biology, chemistry and mathematics,” she said."

		"2" : "To the Editor:",
		"3" : "Re “Climate of Complete Certainty” (column, April 29):",
		"4" : "Bret Stephens does not deny the reality of climate change, but he uses a familiar strategy from the skeptical playbook: misdirection. Rather than acknowledging the role of climate change denial, he blames scientists and their allies for alleged certitude. In fact, the scientific community has taken great pains to analyze and communicate the uncertainties related to climate change.",
		"5" : "In 2013, my colleagues and I published an analysis of scientific predictions related to climate change. We found that scientists had generally either been correct in their predictions, within error bars, or had underestimated the rate at which climate change would unfold.",
		"6" : "For more than two decades, scientists have been the target of attacks designed to create public uncertainty and skepticism not just about proposed solutions, but about the science itself. Polls show that these attacks have worked: Many Americans, even those who accept the reality of climate change, believe that scientists are still uncertain.",

		"13" : "At least 97 percent of the thousands of scientists worldwide who have studied this problem for decades agree that climate change is a genuine threat to our future well-being. Predictions they have made during those decades have proved mistaken only in that climate’s impact is happening much faster than they expected.",
		"14" : "Mr. Stephens’s assertion that just 36 percent of Americans care a “great deal” about the problem is not surprising, since its ultimate impact seems far away while we all have more immediate problems pressing us in our everyday lives. But the concern is growing steadily as more evidence piles up.",

It seemed as though readers could not bring themselves to carefully read and consider a column about climate change written by a conservative, and therefore could not appreciate that Mr. Stephens is neither a denier nor an advocate for inaction with respect to anthropogenic climate change. I would advise them to calm down and read it again, since Mr. Stephens made some excellent points.",

		"20" : "SUSAN COVINGTON, HOUSTON",
		"21" : "To the Editor:",
		"22" : "Bret Stephens presents us with a false comparison when he likens the science of climate change to predictions about Hillary Clinton’s election. Political polls are obviously unscientific and prone to error. The virtually universal conclusion of climate scientists the world over is that global warming can do great harm to our earth. The only uncertainty concerns timing and magnitude.",

Scientists have been explicit that there is a small chance that global warming and its impacts will be less severe than their best estimates.

		"1" : "The United States has long seen itself as a beacon of democracy and a global advocate of human rights and the rule of law. It has faltered, sometimes badly, undermining leaders whose views did not fit its strategic objectives and replacing them with pliant despots. Yet for the most part American presidents, Republican and Democratic, have believed that the United States should provide a moral compass to the world, encouraging people to pursue their right to self-government and human dignity and rebuking foreign leaders who fall short.",
		"2" : "Like so much else under President Trump, though, this idea has now been turned on its head and people are worried about the very survival of the values on which America built its reputation and helped construct an entire international system, including the United Nations. The latest example is Mr. Trump’s decision to invite Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, to the White House.",
		"3" : "Though the Philippines is an ally and a democracy, Mr. Duterte is neither a democratic leader nor a worthy ally. For about two decades as mayor of Davao, he was accused of allowing death squads to roam the city and kill freely. Most victims were poor drug users and low-level criminals, but bystanders, children and political opponents were also caught up in the bloodshed.",
		"4" : "After his election last year, Mr. Duterte took the killing campaign nationwide, effectively giving free license to the police and vigilantes. He has boasted about his tenure in Davao, and admitted to personally killing three kidnappers without trial. The mayhem got so bad that last week a Filipino lawyer formally asked the International Criminal Court to charge Mr. Duterte and 11 officials with mass murder and crimes against humanity over the extrajudicial killings of nearly 10,000 people over the past three decades.",
		"5" : "During the last administration, Mr. Duterte disrespected President Barack Obama by calling him the “son of a whore” and threatened to abandon his country’s alliance with the United States for one with China. This is obviously not a man who should be welcomed to the White House.",
		"6" : "Mr. Trump extended his invitation in a telephone call that was described as “very friendly.” Administration officials said the call was one of several the president made to reassure Southeast Asian leaders of America’s continuing commitment at a time when they were feeling neglected over Mr. Trump’s focus on China, Japan and North Korea. Administration officials said that Mr. Trump was looking to mend ties with the Philippines as a hedge against China’s expansion in the South China Sea. But there is no evidence that he consulted the State Department, or that the White House has done anything to prepare the groundwork for a Duterte visit. The normal way to mend diplomatic ties is to negotiate privately over months and have the process culminate in, not begin with, a White House meeting.",
		"7" : "What is not in any doubt is Mr. Trump’s own authoritarian tendencies and his fondness for other strongman leaders who, like him, chafe at governmental checks and balances, including the courts. Mr. Trump reportedly admires Mr. Duterte’s aggressive rhetoric about fighting the Islamic State and cracking down on drugs. He has praised President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for winning a disputed referendum that will give him vastly more power and invited him to the White House on May 16. He has already given a friendly reception to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, who was barred from the White House after staging a coup four years ago and arresting thousands of political opponents. He has replaced harsh criticism of China with praise for President Xi Jinping, and in the past displayed a bizarre affection for Russia’s Vladimir Putin.",
		"8" : "American presidents must work with foreign leaders of all kinds to advance the national interest. But Mr. Trump erodes America’s reputation when he uncritically embraces those who show the least regard for human rights, rule of law and democracy."

		"1" : "As a young New York Times reporter nearly four decades ago, I helped chronicle the rollout of what proved to be among our country’s greatest economic follies — the alchemistic belief that huge tax cuts can pay for themselves by unleashing faster economic growth.",
		"2" : "Buoyed by this idea, Congress passed the largest tax reductions in history just seven months after Ronald Reagan’s inauguration. I was deeply skeptical of the illogical notion that tax cuts could somehow pay for themselves, so much so that I was attacked by name on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page. That, in turn, caused consternation among my editors in an era when reporting was meant to be less analytical.",
		"3" : "Nonetheless, I felt no joy as the plan immediately made a bad economy worse.",
		"4" : "Now comes Donald Trump, essentially trying to revive that same supply-side credo (famously branded “voodoo economics” by George H. W. Bush) with his proposal for $5.5 trillion of tax giveaways, mostly for business. Even some of the outsize personalities that I encountered in 1981 are back, most notoriously the concept’s godfather, Arthur Laffer, who advised the Trump presidential campaign.",
		"5" : "What proved a bad idea then is a worse one now. Unemployment was 7 percent and rising when President Reagan took office. Today, with unemployment at just 4.6 percent, broad-based fiscal stimulus isn’t likely to create much new employment.",
		"6" : "For its part, the Reagan tax cut increased the budget deficit, helping elevate interest rates over 20 percent, which in turn contributed to the double-dip recession that ensued. The stock market fell by more than 20 percent. Fiscally, the revenue loss totaled 2.9 percent of the average gross domestic product between 1981 and 1985.",
		"7" : "But perhaps the greatest damage inflicted by the Reagan tax cuts was to our political psyche, making respectable — particularly among Republicans — the terrifying notion that high deficits resulting from tax cuts don’t matter because faster economic growth will quickly close the gap. (At the time, this idea was called supply-side economics, but it has now been rebranded with the phrase “dynamic scoring.”)",
		"8" : "In 2002, while trying to justify another set of irresponsible tax cuts, Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly said, “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter.” By the end of George W. Bush’s tenure, the surpluses that he had inherited were squandered, and as the financial crisis raged, the deficit soared to $511 billion before peaking at $1.6 trillion in 2009 (all figures in 2016 dollars).",
		"9" : "Deficits have left a lasting mark in the form of vast piles of national debt — $14 trillion currently, up from $712 billion when Mr. Reagan took office, an almost 20-fold increase. Big deficits can sometimes be advisable, as they were in aiding recovery from the 2009 recession. But incurred pointlessly, as Mr. Trump is proposing, large fiscal gaps simply mean more debt that will be left to our children and grandchildren to pay off.",
		"10" : "A large deficit is another significant difference in the state of the economy compared with 36 years ago and helps explain why Mr. Trump’s business-heavy proposals are not only grossly unfair to middle-class Americans but also terrible policy.",
		"11" : "After dropping to $444 billion in 2015, the federal deficit is again marching upward. By 2026, it is projected to be $1 trillion. In normal times, economists consider a deficit of about 3 percent of G.D.P. — where it is now — to be appropriate.",
		"12" : "The Trump plan isn’t all bad. I understand our need to lower the corporate tax rate to compete with other countries and adjust other provisions to keep companies and jobs here. Critics are correct that our business-tax structure encourages companies to ship jobs and even themselves overseas. But in return for that concession, which would significantly benefit shareholders, we should be raising the 23.8 percent capital gains rate closer to the top rate of 39.6 percent on earned income, not lowering it.",
		"13" : "Should Mr. Trump’s proposal become law, I’ll bet the denouement resembles that of Reagan’s: In 1982, just a year after those cuts, Congress enacted new provisions that recovered about a third of the lost revenues, and by the end of Reagan’s administration, additional tax increases raised that figure to about two-thirds.",
		"14" : "Don’t get me wrong — we have significant economic challenges (as reflected in our anemic sub-2 percent growth rate), and thoughtful tax policy can play a positive role. We haven’t had a serious attack on loopholes, complexities and egregious deductions since 1986, and we desperately need another one.",
		"15" : "But what we don’t need — and can’t afford — is another round of huge, unpaid-for tax reductions that saddle us with large amounts of new debt without producing the growth levels being predicted. Changing the sales slogan from “supply-side economics” to “dynamic scoring” won’t do anything to shield us from the painful consequences."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. — The vast, sagebrush-studded valleys in this huge chunk of wild country, teeming with herds of elk and bison, are home these days to 10 packs of wolves.",
		"2" : "Once among the first species to be listed as endangered, the gray wolf has made a healthy comeback within Yellowstone National Park and its bordering states. Since 1995-96 when 31 wolves were trucked into the park from Canada, their numbers have grown and stabilized to the point that officials could essentially post a “no vacancy sign” at Yellowstone. That’s because the park’s wolf population has hovered for the last decade at 100, give or take, which experts consider Yellowstone’s carrying capacity.",
		"3" : "Protected on parkland, gray wolves show little fear of humans, often living out their lives within view of roads. They attract thousands of tourists a year who sometimes become witnesses to the life-or-death dramas between predator and prey.",
		"4" : "And some catch a glimpse of a rare white wolf.",
		"5" : "“Yellowstone is the best place in the world to view wolves,” said Douglas Smith, the park’s wolf biologist, as he hiked up a fog-shrouded hill searching for one of the packs.",
		"6" : "The sprawling 2.2 million-acre park acts as a laboratory for Dr. Smith and other scientists, who are conducting a long-term study of this very rare population of wolves — unusual because they are neither shot nor trapped. And it turns out a wolf protected from human killing is a very different animal from those that are hunted.",
		"7" : "That may change, researchers say, as more hunting is allowed in the states that surround the park.",
		"8" : "As the packs grew, many wolves roamed outside the national park, replenishing the wild lands. Wolves now number about 1,700 in the Western states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington. Threats to livestock have intensified in recent years, pitting ranchers against conservationists and prompting some states to permit limited wolf hunting again at certain times.",
		"9" : "In March, a United States Court of Appeals paved the way for Wyoming to join Idaho and Montana in allowing wolf hunting. Wildlife officials are now planning a hunting season on gray wolves for this fall, based on the court’s ruling that the state’s plan to manage wolves was adequate to ensure that the once-threatened species would not be imperiled again by hunting wolves near the park or those that leave it.",
		"10" : "Experts say that the gray wolf is no longer in danger of being completely wiped out by hunting. Their extirpation by the 1920s or so was caused by unregulated killing.",
		"11" : "But expanding the hunt for wolves around the edges of the park poses several issues at Yellowstone Park, where the management protects wildlife so people can watch and study it.",
		"12" : "“What will hunting wolves nearby do to that?” Dr. Smith asked.",
		"13" : "A study underway that Yellowstone has joined with Denali and Grand Teton National Parks is examining that very question. A paper published last year by Dr. Smith and others found that sightings of wolves in Denali and Yellowstone “were significantly reduced” by as much as 45 percent from trapping and hunting.",
		"14" : "If the wolves become less visible, that could diminish the steady flow of tourism dollars, given that wolf watching in Yellowstone alone is estimated to generate $35 million a year for the regional economy.",
		"15" : "Officials in Montana have already placed a quota on the number of wolves that could be shot by hunters north of the park — four each season — to minimize the impact on wolf watching in the park.",
		"16" : "Yet another possible effect of expanded hunting would be the disruption of a historic long-term wolf research project.",
		"17" : "Yellowstone’s vast wilderness provides the only place in the world where many packs of wolves, free from human hunting, live in full view of groups of biologists equipped with high-tech research equipment.",
		"18" : "Ten of the park’s wolves wear GPS collars that beam their whereabouts as many as 48 times a day to a satellite, providing researchers with unprecedented detail on what wolves do all day.",
		"19" : "A team of up to 20 researchers and volunteers, sitting on a hilltop with spotting scopes or peering down from aircraft, witness the daily goings-on year-round. Camera traps record remote wolf activity. And because they have lived without the threat of being shot and with near daily tourist traffic — the wolves ignore the researchers and are readily observed.",
		"20" : "As a result, a complex and in some cases unprecedented portrait of wolves is emerging.",
		"21" : "For example, protected wolves regard humans very differently. “Wolf hunters talk about seeing a pack of park wolves outside the boundary, and being able to pick the one they want,” Dr. Smith said. “They just stand there and have no fear.”",
		"22" : "While all wolves are very social with a hierarchy, those pack rules are often corrupted when human hunting enters the picture. In the park, researchers are getting a thorough look at pure wolf social dynamics — within and between packs.",
		"23" : "For the first time, pack longevity has been studied in depth, the life span of a pack is eight to 10 years in the park. One pack called the Druid is more than 20 years old. Hunted wolf packs, on the other hand, often last just two or three years. When one or two of the wolves are shot or trapped, members of the pack often scatter and reform with different members.",
		"24" : "Park wolves live to be about five, double the life span outside its borders. Yellowstone’s oldest wolf reached 12 ½ years.",
		"25" : "Group dynamics also change significantly, sometimes in mercurial ways, when membership shifts or a pack loses individuals. “Personalities matter,” Dr. Smith said, noting that science doesn’t have a good way to assess the effect. “It’s really hard.”",
		"26" : "Then there is the role of the wise wolf to consider. During pack warfare, a deciding factor can be the presence of an elder, a single wolf older than five, that is even more important than the number of wolves, researchers found.",
		"27" : "“It was a surprise,” said Kira Cassidy, a Park Service biologist and an author of the study. “I attribute it to the fact that older wolves will only engage their neighbors if they feel they are likely to win.”",
		"28" : "Research here also leads Dr. Smith to believe that wolf packs are matrilineal. Males come and go, he said, but “Gramma, Mom and the daughter are the ones that stick around” and carry on the pack through generations.",
		"29" : "There is some evidence that the increase in hunting could alter this research. When the alpha female in the Lamar Canyon pack left Yellowstone in 2012 and was shot, the pack split into two and the alpha male left because the new alpha female was his daughter. (Wolves avoid inbreeding.)",
		"30" : "Of course, the life of a wolf is a high-risk occupation and natural deaths occur all the time, especially when a pack tries to kill animals with hooves and horns 20 times their size. In early April, an alpha female with “a belly full of pups” was killed either by an elk or a bison, Dr. Smith said. Because only the alpha female in a group reproduces, “that means the pack won’t have pups this year,” he said.",
		"31" : "Outside the park, ranchers have been vocal in their support of expanding hunting, citing real threats to their livestock.",
		"32" : "Jon Robinett of Dubois, Wyo., says he has lost hundreds of cattle, several horses and six dogs to wolves over the last 20 years. While there are 50 wolves in his part of the Dunoir Valley, allowing hunters to take out five won’t accomplish much, he said.",
		"33" : "“Killing is what wolves do,” he said, adding that even with reduced numbers, “they aren’t going to quit their home range.” The state compensates him for lost cattle, he said, “but it doesn’t make you whole.”",
		"34" : "Some biologists say there are legitimate reasons to allow hunting, perhaps most important to placate residents. “A little blood satisfies a lot of anger,” said Ed Bangs, a retired Fish and Wildlife biologist who led the effort to restore wolves to the northern Rockies.",
		"35" : "“The wolf most likely to get harvested by a hunter is one that is in open areas with road access,” the interface between ranches and wild land, Dr. Bangs said. “So hunters are removing the animals with the highest probability of getting in trouble with livestock.”",
		"36" : "Dr. Smith says the wolf personality is not the only wild card in the Yellowstone frame — humans figure in as well.",
		"37" : "Last year, the famed white wolf left the park and went into Montana for a few days. Dr. Smith said a hunter who hates wolves sought the 11-year-old female out as a prize trophy. But the animal returned to safety in the park.",
		"38" : "Just last month, the wolf was found with severe injuries and was euthanized. Law enforcement is investigating her death. She was almost twice as old as most wolves here, but will be missed. “She was the most coveted wolf to see,” Dr. Smith said."

		"1" : "May is only just beginning, but the temperature in the American League East has been rising rapidly lately. When Baltimore’s Manny Machado took out Dustin Pedroia of Boston with a late slide a little more than a week ago, Pedroia’s teammate Matt Barnes threw a pitch that buzzed Machado’s ear, which the Orioles did not care for — and neither did Pedroia, as he made clear after the game.",
		"2" : "On Sunday in Toronto, when Tampa Bay’s Chris Archer threw a fastball behind the head of Jose Bautista, it was viewed by Blue Jays Manager John Gibbons as payback for Toronto reliever Joe Biagini’s hitting the hand of Rays outfielder Steven Souza Jr. the previous day.",
		"3" : "The Yankees, in contrast, have thus far steered clear of any testy conflict in the division — perhaps because, for the first month of the season, they have found few reasons to take offense.",
		"4" : "Then again, until Monday, they had not played the Blue Jays, the team that during the past two seasons has succeeded not only in repeatedly beating the Yankees but also in getting under their skin.",
		"5" : "If the Blue Jays did little to upset the Yankees’ sensibilities on Monday, they nevertheless cruised to a 7-1 victory at Yankee Stadium, riding the adroit pitching of Marco Estrada and home runs by Bautista, Ryan Goins and Chris Coghlan.",
		"6" : "The defeat dropped the Yankees to one game behind the Baltimore Orioles for the division lead and gave them back-to-back losses for the first time since the opening week of the season, when they lost three in a row.",
		"7" : "That it came to Toronto could hardly be a surprise. The Blue Jays have won 26 of 39 games against the Yankees dating to the beginning of the 2015 season — blowing past them down the stretch in 2015 and winning three of four in late September last season, as Toronto clinched a wild-card berth and all but eliminated the Yankees.",
		"8" : "Their last meeting of 2016 was a memorable one: Yankees pitcher Luis Severino hit the Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson, the Blue Jays’ J. A. Happ answered by plunking Chase Headley, and Severino responded by hitting Justin Smoak.",
		"9" : "That led to two bench-clearing dust-ups in the first two innings, a welt under the eye of Yankees outfielder Tyler Austin, and ejections for Severino, Manager Joe Girardi, the bench coach Rob Thomson and the pitching coach Larry Rothschild. The Yankees had the last word when Mark Teixeira hit a game-winning home run off reliever Jason Grilli in the ninth inning, which Teixeira punctuated with a bat flip and some extra words for Grilli from the dugout.",
		"10" : "The Yankees viewed it as giving the Blue Jays — “the kings of fun,” Headley called them at the time — a little taste of their own sauce.",
		"11" : "It was Bautista, of course, whose bat flip after a late home run in the 2015 playoffs so rankled the Texas Rangers that they hit him in their final meeting last year, which Bautista answered with a hard slide that engendered an overhand right to his chin by Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor.",
		"12" : "“Some people look at it, and they don’t like that aspect of the game,” Yankees reliever Tommy Layne said. “I love it. I think that’s still keeping some of the traditional aspects of protecting your players and your teammates. But I think it breeds a better baseball. How long did people talk about the bat flip and the situation between Texas and Bautista? It brings attention to the game, which is not a bad thing.”",
		"13" : "This season, the Blue Jays have not had much to celebrate. They lost 17 of their first 23 games, and their disabled list includes third baseman Donaldson, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and pitchers Aaron Sanchez and Happ. Even with their modest three-game winning streak, the Blue Jays are eight games behind the Orioles.",
		"14" : "On Monday, Estrada repeatedly stymied the Yankees’ pursuit of a big inning, scattering seven singles over seven innings. He struck out Didi Gregorius with two on to end the third, got Greg Bird to hit into an inning-ending double play with two aboard in the fourth, and retired Aaron Judge and Bird on fly balls with two on in the sixth.",
		"15" : "Asked how Estrada can get hitters out by throwing an 89-m.p.h. fastball and changeup combination up in the strike zone, Judge shrugged. “If I knew, I’d have had four hits,” he said.",
		"16" : "The Blue Jays did not find Severino nearly as baffling. Goins, filling in for Tulowitzki, hit a two-run homer off Severino in the second, and Coghlan, filling in for Donaldson, hit a solo homer in the sixth that finished the night for Severino, who has not beaten the Blue Jays in five starts.",
		"17" : "Earlier in the inning, the Blue Jays scored two runs on a sacrifice fly as Jacoby Ellsbury crashed into the center-field wall to catch Goins’s long drive. But his flip from the seat of his pants to Judge went over the 6-foot-7 outfielder’s head as Smoak and Devon Travis raced home from second and third. Ellsbury injured his left elbow on the play, and though he stayed in the game, he was not sure if he would be ready for Tuesday’s game.",
		"18" : "Bautista applied the crowning blow, hitting a two-run homer off Luis Cessa, who was recalled from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre earlier in the day to replace Bryan Mitchell. It was his 34th home run against the Yankees, the most of any active player.",
		"19" : "“Any time you walk into this building, you know what the name represents, and you want to beat the best, always,” Bautista said.",

You always want to beat the opponent, but there seems to be a higher sense of awareness of how important it is to win when you come into Yankee Stadium. It’s always important to come in here and play good because it sets a statement, not only with them, but for the rest of the division.”"

		"1" : "Jim Kaat was young and Warren Spahn was old, and the kid wanted to learn from the master. He asked a coach to arrange a meeting, and for 20 minutes the ancient lefty told the green lefty about mechanics — how to use the torso to drive to the plate, and so on. The pitchers parted, and then Spahn turned back for a final word.",
		"2" : "“Oh, kid, one more thing I meant to tell you,” he told Kaat. “When the game’s tied in the seventh inning, the game’s just starting. You have to learn how to pitch Mickey Mantle differently in the ninth inning than you did in the first inning.”",
		"3" : "Kaat, who ultimately earned 283 victories in the majors, laughed as he recalled the anecdote by telephone on Monday. “That would be so strange today,” he said.",
		"4" : "Kaat, 78, has stayed in baseball as an analyst for MLB Network. But the games he broadcasts are very different from the ones he played. Noah Syndergaard, the muscular right-hander for the Mets, has made 63 starts — including games in October — in an electrifying young career. He has not completed any, but he has achieved one goal.",
		"5" : "For the second year in a row, Syndergaard throws a harder fastball than any other starter in baseball: 98.2 miles per hour. Only now, he cannot pitch at all, because he tore his right latissimus muscle on Sunday when he came out firing at 100 m.p.h. in Washington. Officially, he is on the 10-day disabled list. But the Mets acknowledged he will miss weeks, not days.",
		"6" : "“It’s really sad to see,” Kaat said. “You get a guy like Syndergaard and so many other young pitchers — they’re so much more talented and gifted than we were.”",
		"7" : "They know how to pitch, too. Half of Syndergaard’s pitches this season have been sliders, curveballs and changeups. He has an impressive repertoire and seems to enjoy the craft, not just the brute force, of pitching, which makes his fixation on velocity such a shame.",
		"8" : "Syndergaard bought so thoroughly into his Thor persona last winter that he should have just carried a hammer to spring training. He was jacked, unapologetically so. Why did the hardest-throwing starter in the majors — 98 miles per hour last season, according to FanGraphs — need to bulk up and throw even harder?",
		"9" : "“I want to set goals, not necessarily throw harder, but just make the game easier,” he said this spring. “Just never become complacent and try to maintain anything, because once you start maintaining, you ultimately lose.”",
		"10" : "That rationale sounds fine on the surface, but it contradicts decades of examples of pitchers who lost a little of their youthful fastballs yet continued to dominate. Syndergaard wanted more, a goal that was noble, perhaps, but ultimately reckless. Smart pitching minds saw an injury coming.",
		"11" : "Tom House, the former pitcher and coach who runs the National Pitching Association in California, told  Bob Klapisch of The Bergen Record in February: “Unfortunately, this is an injury waiting to happen by the second week of June. Unless you’re picking up a ball while you’re getting stronger, you’re just adding muscle that doesn’t know how to throw. It’s unskilled muscle.”",
		"12" : "Sure enough, Syndergaard had not thrown all winter, believing that consecutive seasons with around 200 innings were enough stress on his arm. And sure enough, an injury happened even before House expected.",
		"13" : "“I hate being right about these kinds of things,” House said by phone on Monday, adding that he had almost called the Mets’ team doctor, David Altchek, last week.",
		"14" : "“But it’s none of my business. I’m not with Syndergaard every day; I’m not part of the Mets’ anything. I’m friends with Danny Warthen” — the Mets’ pitching coach — “and I just figured, well, it’s going to run its course. In retrospect, I should have probably called the doctor and just kind of told him what my fears were.”",
		"15" : "House, like Kaat, believes that developing pitchers should throw more, not less. The modern industry believes the opposite. Yet pitchers continue to break down.",
		"16" : "“What happens in today’s game is kids pitch too much, but they don’t throw enough,” House said. “That’s the simplest way to explain it. They haven’t created a broad enough throwing foundation to handle the pitching workloads.",
		"17" : "“My brother and I wore out three garage doors throwing tennis balls against them. We lived at the beach. I bet you I threw a million sea rocks at sea gulls. Not very environmentally friendly, but we were throwing all the time.”",
		"18" : "Kaat worked under the renowned pitching coach Johnny Sain, who believed that pitchers should throw at least a little every day. Two of Sain’s pitchers, Kaat and Tommy John, would go on to throw more than 4,500 innings apiece. No active pitcher has worked even 3,300 innings.",
		"19" : "“The single most important exercise that I did during my career was throwing the baseball,” Kaat said. “Whenever they would say, ‘You sure you’re not throwing too much?’ I would say: ‘Well, this is how I make my living. I’m just spinning the ball. I’m trying to figure out what makes it move, how can I make it do this and do that?’ So my arm always stayed very flexible.”",
		"20" : "Syndergaard is only a product of today’s culture, in which the radar gun too often dictates a pitcher’s value. But he also seems to have held too much sway over his employers, refusing their request for a magnetic resonance imaging for his biceps discomfort last week — and getting away with it.",
		"21" : "“The M.R.I. was not dismissed out of hand simply because Noah said he wouldn’t do it,” General Manager Sandy Alderson told reporters in Atlanta on Monday. “We evaluate whether it’s important to do so in spite of his opposition. That was factored into the decision as well. From that standpoint, who’s not to say that things couldn’t have been done differently?”",
		"22" : "Alderson insisted there was no connection between the lat injury and the biceps problem. But did Syndergaard overcompensate on Sunday, trying to throw too hard to prove a point, and cause a new injury?",
		"23" : "“Anything’s possible,” Alderson conceded.",
		"24" : "All we know, really, is that Syndergaard made the radar gun sizzle on Sunday. At a carnival, he would have won the biggest stuffed animal at the booth. At the ballpark, he won a lengthy trip to the disabled list."

		"1" : "ATLANTA — The Mets’ roster received another significant blow on Monday, one that renewed questions about the club’s handling of injuries, when the team announced that Noah Syndergaard, the hard-throwing ace, would be out indefinitely with a partial tear of his right latissimus muscle.",
		"2" : "Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson, speaking before Monday night’s 7-5 win over the Atlanta Braves, declined to speculate on how many weeks Syndergaard would miss, nor did he want to compare the injury to a similar one that forced Steven Matz, a fellow Mets starter, to miss two months of the 2015 season.",
		"3" : "“It’s going to be a considerable amount of time,” Alderson said.",
		"4" : "Syndergaard underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination on Monday morning in New York after leaving his start in Washington on Sunday after only one inning and a third. After throwing a second-inning strike to the Nationals star Bryce Harper, Syndergaard grimaced and grabbed his right side, leading to his exit.",
		"5" : "The injury severely hampers an already depleted Mets roster that is now without one of its most talented pitchers (Syndergaard), one of its most talented hitters (Yoenis Cespedes), its starting first baseman (Lucas Duda), two infielders (David Wright and Wilmer Flores) and two other crucial pitchers (Steven Matz and Seth Lugo). Rafael Montero will most likely start in place of Syndergaard on Friday.",
		"6" : "“Somebody has got to pick up the slack,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said. “I’m not asking any stating pitcher to be Noah Syndergaard. I’m asking them to be themselves, and go pitch a good game.”",
		"7" : "Robert Gsellman, a rookie starter and Syndergaard’s roommate in New York, showed some improvement early in his start on Monday. He tailed off as the game went on, allowing five runs over five-plus innings. Home runs by Jose Reyes and Michael Conforto, who drove in three runs, helped the Mets solve Julio Teheran, the Braves starter who has confounded them in the past.",
		"8" : "A victory provided a momentary salve on a day when the Mets drew scrutiny over the circumstances surrounding the injury to Syndergaard, whose start last week had been pushed from Thursday to Sunday because of biceps discomfort. Alderson said a doctor told him that Syndergaard’s biceps issue last week was not related to the current injury to his lat muscle, which stretches from the armpit to the back.",
		"9" : "“The question was specifically asked and the answer was, ‘No,’ that there was not a connection,” Alderson said. “Now, that’s an opinion, but coming from a pretty knowledgeable source.”",
		"10" : "The episode added to criticism that the Mets had already drawn regarding injuries, especially to Cespedes and Syndergaard. Cespedes first injured his hamstring on April 20, was not placed on the 10-day disabled list and was given five days of rest. He returned to play, but he landed on the disabled list on April 28 after he reinjured the hamstring.",
		"11" : "“He thought he was ready to go,” Alderson said. “Now, is it a surprise that Cespedes is on the disabled list for the hamstring? No. We knew that he was susceptible to this, and there was some issue. But at the same time, we can’t put somebody on the disabled list who says they’re not hurt.”",
		"12" : "A near mirror episode happened last year with Cespedes and a quadriceps injury, which Alderson said then the Mets hoped to avoid, yet it happened again this year.",
		"13" : "Syndergaard’s injury, though, brought more questions. He was scratched the morning of his Thursday start because the Mets did not want to risk further injury, as he had been dealing with what the team called right biceps tendinitis and soreness in his biceps and shoulder.",
		"14" : "Syndergaard called it a “little hiccup” and said he felt better with anti-inflammatory medication, but insisted he could have started on Thursday. He also refused an M.R.I., a decision that was heavily scrutinized a few days later after he walked off the mound holding his side with a trainer.",
		"15" : "The Mets had cleared Syndergaard to start after he threw a bullpen session with no problem in front of coaches on Friday.",
		"16" : "Alderson said on Monday that it was his decision to allow Syndergaard to pitch.",
		"17" : "“It was with input from a variety of different sources, including Noah himself,” he said. “The M.R.I. was not dismissed out of hand simply because Noah said he wouldn’t do it. We evaluate whether it’s important to do so in spite of his opposition.”",
		"18" : "Alderson said he “sincerely” believed that Syndergaard was being truthful about feeling fine.",
		"19" : "“He was throwing 100 miles an hour in the first inning,” Alderson said. “Was that because he was trying to show someone or us that he was fine? I don’t know the answer to that.”",
		"20" : "Asked whether Syndergaard was compensating for one discomfort and it led to another, Alderson said, “Anything’s possible.”",
		"21" : "Alderson said he did not want to speculate, but he said the Mets would have to evaluate whether Syndergaard’s adding more muscle in the off-season had had an adverse effect, or if changes needed to be made to Syndergaard’s hard throwing.",
		"22" : "Mets strength and conditioning coaches visit players in the off-season, Alderson said, but “we don’t control everything they do.”",
		"23" : "Asked if he regretted any decisions on Syndergaard, Alderson said it was hard to answer. He took in all the available information, he said, from the medical staff to Syndergaard to his own experience, in making the decision.",
		"24" : "“But let’s assume he got the M.R.I. and it didn’t show anything and he got injured,” he said. “Am I better off? The team’s not better off.”",
		"25" : "Over the weekend, Alderson said the Mets needed to appraise everything from weight training to hydration of players, such as Cespedes, who had a history of leg issues, to prevent recurring injuries. On Monday, Alderson said that he had “absolute confidence” in the information he received from the medical staff.",
		"26" : "When Alderson took over as general manager in 2011, he said he knew the Mets had a reputation for struggling with injuries. “I don’t seem to have done anything to improve it,” he said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "A few months ago, W.N.B.A. President Lisa Borders reached out to Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd, who had injured her ankle while playing in China. Borders wanted to see how Loyd was recovering. During their conversation, Borders also asked Loyd for any ideas on how to broaden the game and help expand the league’s reach.",
		"2" : "Loyd recommended that the W.N.B.A. stream its games on Twitter, as other leagues have done. The idea struck a chord with Borders. On Monday night, the W.N.B.A. became the first women’s professional sports league to sign a rights deal with Twitter.",
		"3" : "“I’m looking forward to calling her and telling her that you made a suggestion, I heard it, we listened and we now have a deal with Twitter,” Borders said on Monday afternoon.",
		"4" : "The announcement of the three-year deal coincided with Twitter’s presentation to advertising buyers on Monday night at Digital Content NewFronts, an industry conference in New York. Twitter will stream 20 regular-season games in each of the next three seasons, starting with the game between the Dallas Wings and the Phoenix Mercury on May 14.",
		"5" : "The games are exclusive to Twitter and are not simulcasts of local or national television games. Twitter is paying the W.N.B.A. guaranteed money to stream the games, but the league would not release the financial details. The W.N.B.A. also has a national television deal with ESPN that runs through 2022 and includes 16 games per season and coverage of the playoffs, the draft and the All-Star Game.",
		"6" : "“We are excited to help extend the reach of women’s sports around the world by collaborating further with the N.B.A. to be the home of weekly live W.N.B.A. games for the next three seasons,” Anthony Noto, Twitter’s chief operating officer, said in a news release. “The growing women’s basketball fan base will be able to turn to Twitter to watch free games side by side with the real-time conversation.”",
		"7" : "This is the latest sports deal for Twitter, which streams weekly out-of-market Major League Baseball and N.H.L. games, some PGA Tour events and other minor events.",
		"8" : "Twitter also streamed 10 of the N.F.L.’s “Thursday Night Football” games last season, but Amazon outbid Twitter for this season’s digital package. Amazon will air 10 Thursday night games on its Amazon Prime service, for which customers pay $99 per year. The N.F.L. deal is Amazon’s first foray into sports rights.",
		"9" : "Facebook also recently struck deals to stream live sporting events. During the 2016-17 season, the N.B.A.’s Development League games were streamed on Facebook Live. In March, Facebook and Major League Soccer announced that at least 22 games in the 2017 season would be available on Facebook.",
		"10" : "“Sports are inherently social, with the power to build and connect communities around the world,” Dan Reed, Facebook’s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. “This aligns closely with our mission, and we feel Facebook is a natural home for sports content, including live games. Early experiments with these events on Facebook have delivered great results for fans, broadcasters and rights holders.”",
		"11" : "For now, major broadcasters like ABC/ESPN, NBC, CBS and Fox Sports dominate the market for sports rights and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to televise games. Major internet companies like Facebook and Amazon have the financial resources to compete with traditional broadcasters, although they have not invested much money in sports rights deals so far.",
		"12" : "“It’s not clear yet how to make these profitable in their own right, but because there’s a belief that it can be value-enhancing, I think you’re just going to see more deals of this nature so long as the leagues are willing to sell those rights separately,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.",
		"13" : "He added, “It’s one of those things where it’s worth putting some money into because they may want to go bigger.”",
		"14" : "Still, deals with internet and social media companies are a way for smaller leagues like the W.N.B.A. to add revenue and experiment with new ways to show their games. In 2016, the W.N.B.A. streamed the ring ceremony for the Minnesota Lynx on Facebook.",
		"15" : "“If folks can’t be physically in a market inside an arena, then we look for them to use tools like Twitter to enjoy the games,” Borders said. “Folks have their choice of when they want to see games and how they want to see games. This is a real nod to the future, on recognizing that some of our fans are consuming sports in very different ways.”"

		"1" : "David August Trimble first held the Red Hook Criterium in March 2008 on the sleepy streets of Red Hook, Brooklyn, with about 15 cyclists on bikes intended for a velodrome. It was informal and unsanctioned, with little vision for the future.",
		"2" : "“The first year it was just, ‘How do I make a race that’s super fun and gets people to come to my birthday party?’” Trimble said.",
		"3" : "But Trimble, who has a background in auto racing, eventually turned his attention toward making the race a yearly event.",
		"4" : "“In my head, the idea was to create the Formula One of bike racing,” he said.",
		"5" : "Trimble’s goal is to create a spectacle, despite grumblings that the race is becoming detached from its roots.",
		"6" : "On Saturday night, a warm breeze carried Trimble’s voice from the booming loudspeakers across the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal as he counted down the start for 100 riders in the 10th Red Hook Criterium, now a well-loved fixed-gear bike race known as the Red Hook Crit.",
		"7" : "No longer a chaotic street race, the event is contested on a winding, closed-circuit course just over a kilometer long, featuring tight chicanes, sweeping turns and high-speed straightaways.",
		"8" : "Kacey Lloyd won the first Red Hook Crit and competed in several more, often placing in the top 10 of what was until 2014 a coed event. Lloyd, who now oversees the race’s website, said she welcomed the race’s evolution.",
		"9" : "“It’s not just a bunch of yahoos in the street anymore,” she said. “There’s so much more structure around it. Some people think that’s a bad thing. I think it’s fantastic.”",
		"10" : "The planning eventually became so time consuming that Lloyd and Trimble stopped competing in the event.",
		"11" : "Red Hook took a major turn toward becoming a more well-oiled, professional event in 2013 when Rockstar Games, a video game company, signed on as the title sponsor. In the preceding years, registration was limited to 100 riders on a first-come-first-served basis, and there were no qualifying races. The sponsorship allowed the organizers to accept more entries.",
		"12" : "That year, starting with the opening race in Brooklyn, the crit expanded to a four-race series. From 2010 to 2012, contests were held in Brooklyn and Milan. But with additional resources and growing interest in fixed-gear races, a stop in Barcelona and a second race at the Brooklyn Navy Yard were added. (The Navy Yard event was a one-time race, and a London race was added in 2015.)",
		"13" : "By 2014, there were enough cyclists to create a women’s division. This year’s crit had 279 men and 69 women complete qualifying. The top 100 men reached the final, while there were 60 spots in the women’s final.",
		"14" : "What began as an underground night race among friends at the intersection of Richards and Dikeman Streets now attracts some of the world’s top cyclists.",
		"15" : "The 2017 field included Colin Strickland, the 2016 series winner, who snagged three race victories with team Allez Allez-Specialized; Callum Skinner, a gold and silver medalist in track cycling for Britain at the 2016 Olympics; and the retired World Tour rider Francesco Chicchi of Italy. Francisca Campos, a former Olympic mountain biker from Chile, returned to Red Hook after finishing ninth in the 2016 women’s standings.",
		"16" : "Trimble, 34, said he wanted to keep the race open to everyone, but acknowledged that rising performance levels made it difficult for all but the top riders.",
		"17" : "“When we started, the high-level athletes were national track champions,” he said. “Now they’re gold medalists.”",
		"18" : "The Red Hook race has also inspired similar fixed-gear criteriums in the United States and Europe.",
		"19" : "“You can’t talk about racing fixed-gear bikes without talking about the Red Hook Crit,” said James Grady, the founder of San Francisco’s Mission Crit. The Mission Crit held its fourth annual race a week before Red Hook’s, and attracted some of the same riders.",
		"20" : "Zach Morvant, who competed at Mission and Red Hook, said more emphasis was placed on preparation than ever before. Morvant focuses on interval training, honing his track bike handling, and is attentive to nutrition.",
		"21" : "“Drinking a beer before a race, that doesn’t happen anymore,” he said.",
		"22" : "The increased participation meant adding structures such as qualifying heats and time trials to establish starting position. More racers also led to a greater focus on safety and course design. Red Hook has faced criticism for the risks of fixed-gear bikes racing at upward of 35 miles per hour, without brakes, on a course with multiple turns. A competitor sustained a shattered jaw in 2013.",
		"23" : "“I’ve adapted a lot of safety aspects from motor sports into this race,” Trimble said. “Like the way we use course marshals, and the way we use flags, and the way we use crash protection.”",
		"24" : "In 2015, Trimble began working with Liam Worthy, a cycling consultant from London who worked at the 2012 Olympics.",
		"25" : "Some precautions include applying grip tape to areas of the track prone to tire slippage, and creating “see throughs” at corners using small orange concrete markers to lessen the risk of hitting the metal barriers enclosing the course.",
		"26" : "After each heat, Worthy rides the course to observe the conditions and make any adjustments. His team of marshals is positioned along the course and communicates safety hazards using flags, as in motor racing.",
		"27" : "Crashes are inevitable, though. Several occurred on Saturday, with the most serious in the men’s final, which was red flagged with five laps left so medical staff could tend to an injured rider.",
		"28" : "The future of the Red Hook Crit will depend on reaching more spectators and keeping them engaged during a full day of racing, Trimble said.",
		"29" : "“Whenever we pick a venue in another city, we really think, ‘How can this grow?’” he said. “The goal is to make bike racing spectator-friendly.”",
		"30" : "The Red Hook race has built partnerships with food and drink vendors, and a five-kilometer race on the bike track was introduced in 2012. Live streaming is a likely next step in widening the crit’s audience.",
		"31" : "“When you’re here in person, you feel that energy,” Lloyd said. “We have to figure out how to actually come remotely close to that on a screen. Doing it properly is a very expensive process.”",
		"32" : "The organizers already broadcast the race on Jumbotrons at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal — just as Formula One does.",
		"33" : "The costs associated with bike races are often insurmountable. The Philadelphia International Cycling Classic, which began in 1985, was canceled this year because of a lack of funding.",
		"34" : "Trimble does not play down the financial obstacles.",
		"35" : "“It could keep going, or it could not,” he said. “There are steps we need to take to make it viable. Every year it gets more expensive.”",
		"36" : "Saturday’s final race came down to the two breakaway riders, Strickland and Stefan Schäfer of Germany. Schäfer, who was the only rider to beat Strickland in the 2016 Red Hook series, took the victory on the final lap. A budding rivalry could be a good thing.",
		"37" : "“I think it has huge potential,” Trimble said. “I think we have the right formula.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "A TV network is accused of political bias: hardly a surprise in 2017. But what if the network is a sports broadcaster?",
		"2" : "An unusual strain of partisanship — at least in the sports corner of the news media — emerged last week after ESPN announced it was laying off dozens of employees. The public reaction included jeers toward the network for what some viewers perceived as a leftward slant in ESPN’s coverage, a reflection of how the country’s raw political nerves and cultural divisions have spilled over into a world that many value as a pristine redoubt from worldly concerns: sports.",
		"3" : "“It’s a sign of the times,” said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who is an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Professional Studies. “I think people are looking for bias, and opinion, and information that in some way involves some hidden signal or indication that there’s a political bias in one direction or another.”",
		"4" : "It is not as if American sports and politics have never intersected. From Jackie Robinson’s breaking Major League Baseball’s color barrier to Billie Jean King’s fight for gender equality in tennis to John Carlos and Tommie Smith’s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics, many moments and figures in sports history mark social mileposts.",
		"5" : "And ESPN has had no shortage of political story lines to explore lately, after quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem in protest of what he saw as widespread American racism, the United States women’s soccer team and women’s hockey team raised issues of equal pay in labor disputes, and several members of the New England Patriots declined an invitation to the White House.",
		"6" : "But for fans to detect a viewpoint from a mainstream sports broadcaster appears to be a novel development.",
		"7" : "In some cases, ESPN has been accused of putting a thumb on the scale of social debates that are not settled. A galvanizing incident for critics was Caitlyn Jenner’s winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, ESPN’s annual award show, in 2015, after Ms. Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon, announced she was transgender.",
		"8" : "In other cases, conservative writers like Ben Domenech have cast ESPN’s perceived political approach as flawed simply for the network’s willingness to mingle politics and sports rather than preserving its TV channels and digital platforms as sports-only zones, an escape from society’s headier issues.",
		"9" : "Even Linda Cohn, a longtime anchor of “SportsCenter,” ESPN’s flagship highlights show, blamed politics for some of the network’s woes. In a radio interview on Thursday, she said, “I felt that the old-school viewers were put in a corner,” adding, “If anyone wants to ignore that fact, they’re blind.”",
		"10" : "The claim that the layoffs somehow resulted from disenchantment with political bias is most likely untrue. Industry analysts have tied ESPN’s job cuts to radically shifting habits of media consumption — notably the fact that millions of people are turning away from cable TV, which for decades has been ESPN’s mother lode for revenue — and to other business-related factors.",
		"11" : "“I’m not aware of a tangible connection that has expressed itself through any data,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, in reference to theories that a political slant helped cause layoffs. He added, “There are much more obvious things to point to.”",
		"12" : "Still, some viewers seized on a rare moment of public vulnerability for ESPN to air their grievances, an echo of Gamergate, a heated dispute that escalated a few years ago when video game reviewers were accused of inappropriately infusing politics and biases on other subjects into their work, leading to a campaign of harassment against those who were derogatorily called “social justice warriors.”",
		"13" : "(It is difficult to discern, of course, whether the complaints lodged against ESPN on social media and other digital platforms represented a small or large portion of the network’s viewership.)",
		"14" : "In The Ringer, the writer Bryan Curtis recently concluded, sympathetically, that sportswriting had become “a liberal profession.” In debates such as whether the Washington Redskins’ name and imagery are offensive, he said, most sportswriters consider there to be only one right-thinking side.",
		"15" : "The conservative writer Michael Brendan Dougherty responded in The Week that the sports media’s “hegemonic liberalism” put it “in an antagonistic position not just with fans, but with the entire sports culture beyond journalism.”",
		"16" : "ESPN’s president, John Skipper, told the network ombudsman last year that ESPN and its parent company, Disney, were committed to “diversity and inclusion,” and that they “view this not as a political stance but as a human stance.”",
		"17" : "But conservatives might disagree with Mr. Skipper’s parsing, and Bob Ley, one of ESPN’s longest-tenured anchors, perhaps hinted at one byproduct of ESPN’s “diversity and inclusion” when he told the ombudsman, Jim Brady, in reference to gender and racial emphases in personnel: “We’ve done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.”",
		"18" : "An ESPN-commissioned study last October found that 28 percent of the network’s consumers believed it was politically biased, according to figures provided by ESPN. Of that 28 percent, 56 percent believed the network was biased in a liberal direction, while 37 percent said it was biased in a conservative direction.",
		"19" : "Two events in particular polarized viewers against ESPN, according to the study, which was conducted by Langer Research Associates: Ms. Jenner’s receiving her award, and the firing of the analyst Curt Schilling after he ridiculed transgender people in a Facebook post in response to North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill. The two incidents made 16 percent and 12 percent more viewers, respectively, feel worse about ESPN than better (the majority’s views were unaffected).",
		"20" : "By contrast, coverage of Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an N.F.L. team, and a town hall event in October with President Barack Obama both resulted in slightly more ESPN viewers feeling better about the network than feeling worse, according to ESPN.",
		"21" : "Clay Travis, a Fox Sports contributor and editor of the website Outkick the Coverage, has labeled the network “MSESPN,” a reference to MSNBC, the cable news channel that frequently skews liberal in its analysis. Giving the courage award to Ms. Jenner, he said in an interview, smacked of “social engineering” on behalf of ESPN. He has also criticized what he called the “lionization” of Mr. Kaepernick.",
		"22" : "Mr. Pilson said he believed that amid the present political deluge, even sports media outlets could not help but get wet.",
		"23" : "“People are either anticipating, expecting or microwatching sportscasters to see if they can detect any bias,” he said.",
		"24" : "Barry Blyn, ESPN’s vice president for consumer insights, noted in an interview that ratings for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC had not fallen off since November.",

		"3" : "“I don’t think it’s about me, it’s about our players,” said Boucher, 45, who was hired last May after the Senators missed the playoffs and fired Dave Cameron. “They are the ones who deserve the credit for how they’ve developed, stuck together and created a soul inside that group.”",
		"4" : "His team appeared relaxed and loose as it went through its paces at practice Monday at the Garden. The pressure of the games ahead against the favored Rangers was not fazing Ottawa’s skaters or their coach.",

		"6" : "Ottawa’s players say the precise and exacting Boucher instilled the right dynamic from the first day of training camp. The work ethic Boucher established has carried over into springtime for a franchise that has not advanced past the second round since the 2007 finals against the Anaheim Ducks.",

		"10" : "His defense-first system appears to have the Senators on the same page, and for Mike Hoffman, who scored 26 goals this season, the results for these resurgent Senators are not surprising. He also played for Boucher as a teenager with the Drummondville Voltigeurs, who won the Quebec junior league title in 2009.",
		"11" : "“Not much has changed since then,” Hoffman, 27, said. “It’s still about attention to detail and exact routes and plays. It’s neat that eight years later our paths have crossed again.”",
		"12" : "Ottawa ousted the more physical Boston Bruins in six games in the first round, and with a two-game advantage over the Rangers, they could take a commanding series lead Tuesday.",
		"13" : "Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who scored four goals including the winner in Saturday’s 6-5 victory in double overtime, said Boucher’s style had benefited the entire roster.",
		"14" : "“Everyone when we go out there is relentless; everyone wants to win,” Pageau said. “We found a way to win, and it’s when we trust our system and when we play in it. As players, we really respect and have bought into his system.”",
		"15" : "Despite their advantage this series, Boucher will not let his Senators ease up.",

		"15" : "The Cavaliers found that out in the first half, as they built an 18-point lead only to watch the Raptors go on a 19-3 run to cut their deficit to 41-39.",
		"16" : "But Cleveland regrouped and, playing a turnover-free second quarter, led at the half, 62-48.",
		"17" : "James’ legs looked fresh early on as he and Irving teamed on an alley-oop.",
		"18" : "After James poked the ball away for a steal, Irving took possession as both headed up the floor on a break. James pointed toward the backboard, and Irving got the message, bouncing a pass high off the glass that James dunked with his left hand.",
		"19" : "ROCKETS 126, SPURS 99 Trevor Ariza scored 23 points, James Harden added 20 points and 14 rebounds, and the Rockets stormed past San Antonio in the series opener by going 22 for 50 on 3-point attempts.",
		"20" : "While the hot shooting was not completely unexpected from the explosive Rockets, who led by as many as 39 points, the defense was. Houston actively rotated to San Antonio’s shooters and had both defenders stay on Kawhi Leonard on screens.",
		"21" : "“They came out hot tonight and we just have to do a better job defensively,” said Leonard, who fought his way to 21 points on 5-for-14 shooting. “We kind of got stagnant there a little bit. I give my hats to them, they played a great game.”",
		"22" : "Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich called a timeout 80 seconds into the game, berating David Lee for a missed defensive assignment that led to a 3-pointer. It did not help.",
		"23" : "BIRD’S EXIT FOLLOWS A PLAN Larry Bird made the decision last year.",
		"24" : "After nearly 40 years in the N.B.A., he had started plotting an exit strategy.",
		"25" : "Bird, a 60-year-old Hall of Famer, finally told the rest of the world Monday: He was stepping down as the Indiana Pacers’ president for basketball operations, turning the reins over to Kevin Pritchard and remaining in the organization as a scout and consultant.",
		"26" : "“Maybe when I turn 70, I’ll come back,” Bird joked.",
		"27" : "Bird’s story is well known to millions — the small-town prep star who led Indiana State to the 1979 N.C.A.A. championship game against Magic Johnson and Michigan State, won three Most Valuable Player Awards and three N.B.A. titles in Boston, and then helped the Dream Team capture Olympic gold in 1992. In August 1992, the man nicknamed Larry Legend and the Hick from French Lick, a reference to his Indiana hometown, retired as a player but remained with the Celtics as a special assistant until the Pacers offered him their head-coaching position in 1997.",
		"28" : "Bird took the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals three straight times and was named the league’s coach of the year in his debut season. A heart ailment prompted Bird to follow through on another promise — that he would coach only three seasons. He walked away weeks after Indiana lost to the Lakers in the 2000 finals.",
		"29" : "Three years later, a rejuvenated and healthier Bird returned to the team as the president for basketball operations.",
		"30" : "This time, Bird put together teams that went to three more conference finals and earned him the N.B.A.’s Executive of the Year Award in 2011-12. Bird is the only person in league history to be named an M.V.P. and coach and executive of the year.",
		"31" : "Bird explained that he informed the team owner Herb Simon last summer that he had signed his final contract to run the team. Then Bird called two confidantes into his office — Pritchard and Peter Dinwiddie, the Pacers’ vice president for basketball operations — and repeated the message.",
		"32" : "“This is not a shock to me, as Larry has always been upfront about someday stepping down,” Simon said. “I thank him for all that he has done and am very pleased he is remaining with the Pacers in a different capacity.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "SAN FRANCISCO — Airbnb agreed on Monday to settle a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, putting to rest litigation that could have hampered the company’s efforts to expand and go public.",
		"2" : "In the settlement, Airbnb essentially agreed to San Francisco’s demand to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws. It followed the company’s dropping of a lawsuit in December over a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms. Taken together, the actions mean Airbnb has cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest markets in the United States.",
		"3" : "The latest settlement removes a regulatory cloud over the company as it readies itself for a public offering, even though Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco and has a valuation of about $30 billion, still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets. The company’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, said this year that the company could be ready to go public in a year.",
		"4" : "Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business who studies the so-called sharing economy, said, “As Airbnb gears up to go public over the next couple of years, creating a stable environment with less regulatory uncertainty is good for them.” He added, “While it is well past the point where regulations pose an existential threat to the company, regulatory issues are still the biggest source of uncertainty about its future revenue streams.”",
		"5" : "Airbnb and another short-term rental company, HomeAway, brought the lawsuit against San Francisco in June over a decision by the city’s Board of Supervisors to fine the companies $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.",
		"6" : "The board imposed the fines after it realized that hosts had not been complying with a cumbersome process passed in 2014 that asked them to register in person at a city office overseeing short-term rentals. Airbnb was so influential in the creation of the original rule that it was often referred to as the Airbnb law. Airbnb responded to the fines by suing the city.",
		"7" : "David Campos, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said at a news conference announcing the settlement, “Three years ago, we said the law being passed, which was written by Airbnb, won’t work because there was no skin in the game in terms of enforcement.”",
		"8" : "Under the settlement between the city and the companies, Airbnb and other services like HomeAway will collect data from people who rent their homes out for less than a month on their sites. San Francisco will use that information to vet and register hosts.",
		"9" : "Companies like Airbnb will have to regularly provide the city with the data it needs to enforce local laws. The companies will also cancel reservations and deactivate listings if the city notifies them of an invalid registration.",
		"10" : "The city also preserved its ability to hold companies like Airbnb accountable by fining them $1,000 per violation if they do not take down illegal listings.",
		"11" : "“There are 2,100 registered hosts and about 8,000 listed. We don’t have exact numbers, but it’s not a secret that there are a lot of folks gaming the system and violating the law,” Dennis J. Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney, said.",
		"12" : "Airbnb said the deal with San Francisco was the latest step in its plan to work with local governments on short-term rental legislation and tax collection. The company has come to similar agreements in New Orleans and Chicago.",
		"13" : "“We want to work with cities as partners,” said Chris Lehane, the head of public policy at Airbnb. “We are appreciative of the work with the San Francisco city attorney’s office.” Mr. Lehane said the new system would likely be put into effect by 2018.",
		"14" : "Mr. Lehane declined to say how settling outstanding legislation would affect the company’s ability to go public. He said complying with laws and working with local governments would allow Airbnb to “build the foundation” and make sure it was “getting the basics right.”",
		"15" : "The settlement is contingent on the approval of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, some of whom spoke favorably of the deal at a news conference hosted by Mr. Herrera.",
		"16" : "Airbnb also said last week that it would allow the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing to conduct fair-housing tests on hosts in California. Under the agreement, state agents can pose as potential travelers to see whether a host complies with antidiscrimination and fair-housing laws.",
		"17" : "“This is all part of a broader shift towards Airbnb taking on more regulatory responsibility,” Mr. Sundararajan said. “It’s also first steps, over time, toward governments trusting Airbnb to assume more responsibility for regulating their hosts.”"

Linda Benanti, a voice teacher and former Broadway actress, is often name-checked in her daughter’s cabaret show and on her Twitter feed, portrayed — in Laura’s telling, anyway — as a voice of well-intentioned parental nagging, encouragement and reason. It’s a bond that has grown even stronger since Laura gave birth to a daughter of her own, Ella Rose Benanti-Brown, on Feb. 14.",
		"2" : "Linda and Laura Benanti will bring their delightfully sparring relationship, as well as some of their favorite songs, to audiences in a cabaret show, “The Story Goes On,” that they will perform at Feinstein’s/54 Below on Friday and Saturday. Recently, at Laura Benanti’s home in West Harlem, Laura was settling into her new life as a mother, with Ella snoozing in her lap, while Linda looked on in appreciation.",
		"3" : "Together they tried to predict how Linda’s mothering skills had been passed down (“I’m going to be that weird parent at the sleepover, trying to make sure everybody’s nice to her,” Laura announced), while also campaigning not so subtly for the performer’s next Broadway role. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.",
		"4" : "How has your relationship changed since Ella’s birth?LAURA BENANTI She was here for the first 10 days of Ella’s life. LINDA BENANTI Pitched a tent, moved in, took care of [Laura and Patrick Brown, her husband] so they could take care of the baby. And then they came out to our house. LAURA Because I lost my mind. The first 10 days, it was like, everything’s perfect! The baby’s amazing! And then the day she left, everything went to hell. The baby was inconsolable.",
		"5" : "Did you always know Laura would grow up to be an actress?LINDA Oh, Laura knew. [Laughs] It wasn’t me saying: “You know what, honey? I think you might like this.” This was Laura getting up on her wooden Fisher-Price slide, going, “Presenting — !”LAURA Shy. Always shy. My first words were, “Can I have an agent?”LINDA I filmed her saying that.",
		"6" : "Laura, when did you realize that your mother was a talented performer in her own right?LAURA When I was 5 years old, I was coming up the stairs and I saw my mom standing there, singing “A Quiet Thing” a cappella, and it was such a differentiating moment for me. I realized that we are separate from each other — she has dreams and goals. You weren’t just there to bring me stuff. It stuck with me my whole life. LINDA You used to critique my voice students. This one particular student was not great. Laura was on my lap, I think you were about 2, and he sang and she looked at him and she went, “No.” LAURA Telling people what to do since 1981.",
		"7" : "Linda, how could you be sure your professional assessments of Laura were objective, and not just coming from a place of motherly pride?LAURA I’m actually interested in this answer as well. LINDA It’s complicated. I was trying not to go, “That’s my daughter — she’s brilliant!,” because I see a lot of moms like that. But as a voice teacher, I know someone’s voice could develop really early and then plateau out. You wait and see. My husband and I both felt it was really important for her to develop who she is from the inside. LAURA You’re going to get so much hate mail from the stage moms. The entire cast of “School of Rock” is going to come after you.",
		"8" : "What is it like now, to see Laura go through a negative experience, like not getting a role she wanted ...  LAURA Never. No. Always got it. So, no that one.",
		"9" : "... or getting a bad review? How do you process that as her mother?LAURA How do you process that?LINDA I think you process that like any parent would process anything that happens to their child. Having been in the industry before, I was probably more nervous than a normal parent would have been. And more excited than a normal parent. LAURA A bad review, you’re like, meh. But when it’s been personal, you want to protect me and correct someone’s misinterpretation.",
		"10" : "LINDA And hit them.",
		"11" : "Laura was in “Gypsy,” a show about a notorious stage mother who comes to resent her daughter for achieving a stardom she did not. Did you feel any of those feelings yourself?LAURA She’s like the opposite. Even in my speech, I called her the anti-Mama Rose. [Breathlessly] When I won the Tony Award. LINDA I never, ever felt, “Oh, that should have been me.” Not in a million years. LAURA You were saying for years I should play her [Louise in “Gypsy”]. LINDA There are a lot of roles that I always thought that about. Amalia [in “She Loves Me”] was one of them. Louise was one of them. LAURA [Whispers] Say “My Fair Lady.” LINDA And “My Fair Lady” is definitely one of them. Gee! Obviously. LAURA Good job.",
		"12" : "When did you commit to these concerts at Feinstein’s/54 Below?LAURA When I was pregnant, and, like, “Being a mom’s going to be easy!” And now I’m like, “Great.” LINDA It’ll be fine. LAURA I’m excited to do this with you. I wish you had continued on, because you’re so talented. I wish you’d been able to pursue that for yourself, and that you weren’t in a position where you had to take care of me, and transition solely to being a voice teacher. I feel like 35 years later, you have an opportunity to share your gift with people, and it is a gift.",
		"13" : "Do you think Ella will follow in Laura’s footsteps?LAURA My husband was playing the piano for Ella — he was playing “Für Elise,” the only piano piece he remembers — and her eyes welled up with tears. And we were like, whoa, O.K., that’s a one-off. He did it again the next day — same thing. LINDA She’s going to sing. LAURA She better. LINDA Laura had a very husky voice when she was a baby. And as her mom, I thought, “Where does she get this?” We called her Moose. LAURA I’ve talked to a lot of therapists about this."

		"1" : "Michael Moore has brought his zeal, his humor and his outrage to film, television and books. And now he’s bringing them to Broadway.",
		"2" : "This left-wing provocateur is not shy about his agenda, made explicit on a preliminary poster for the production, which poses the question, in all capital letters, “Can a Broadway show bring down a sitting president?”",
		"3" : "His plan, he said, is to perform a scripted (but also responsive to the news) one-man (more-or-less) show, called “The Terms of My Surrender,” eight times a week for 12 weeks, starting in July. He said that the show would simultaneously be entertaining and infuriating — not stand-up comedy, not a TED Talk, not a rally — but “a very developed piece of entertainment for people who like to think.”",
		"4" : "“It’s a humorous play about a country that’s just elected a madman — I mean, there’s really no other way to put it,” he said in an interview at Sardi’s, the theater district mainstay.",
		"5" : "He was characteristically shlumpy, in an oversized black pullover hoodie and a red 49ers baseball cap; gracious to the passers-by who thanked him for his activism and asked for a handshake or a selfie; and thoughtful about theater, as he explained what a firebrand was doing amid the “Cats” crowd.",
		"6" : "“We’re 10 blocks from Trump Tower, we’re in the corporate capital of America, we’re in the financial capital of America, we’re in the media capital of America,” Mr. Moore said. “If one was going to stand on a stage and do the things that I’m going to do, there’s only one place to do it, and it’s here in this city and it’s right here at the epicenter of creative expression and free speech.”",
		"7" : "He said that he had been thinking about trying his hand at theater for some time, but the election last year of Donald J. Trump as president — which Mr. Moore correctly predicted — provided an impetus to do it now. “Can something like this unravel an unhinged man?” he asked. “I think that discombobulation might be our most effective path to undoing his presidency.”",
		"8" : "However, he said it was not solely about the current president. “To say it’s just about Trump would simplify it,” he said. “I think people will find themselves laughing one minute and wanting to go look for some pitchforks and torches the next.”",
		"9" : "Although Mr. Moore is a Broadway novice, “The Terms of My Surrender” has immediately attracted industry attention. The Shubert Organization has agreed to present it in the 1,018-seat Belasco Theater. Michael Mayer, a Tony winner for “Spring Awakening,” is the director, and David Rockwell, a Tony winner for “She Loves Me,” will design the set. The show’s lead producers are IMG Original Content, making its first stage venture, and Carole Shorenstein Hays, a frequent Broadway producer.",
		"10" : "“I don’t know if I would call it a play; but it is a theater piece,’’ Mr. Mayer said. “There is going to be a certain amount of rabble-rousing. There’s a good chance we’ll have some surprise guests throughout the run, and some surprise postshow excursions that will vary night to night.”",
		"11" : "Mr. Moore, 63, became famous as a documentary filmmaker, bursting into public consciousness with the groundbreaking “Roger and Me,” in 1989, about his hometown, Flint, Mich., and winning an Oscar in 2003 for “Bowling for Columbine.” His theatrical experience is limited — he starred in two plays in high school, and tested out some of his new material in London.",
		"12" : "But he has an unexpected fondness for theater. As a child, he spent summers with relatives on Staten Island, and saw an occasional Broadway show, starting with “Fiddler on the Roof.” He has seen a lot of one-man and one-woman shows. He was even once mugged in Times Square. And he clearly believes in the power of theater to effect change.",
		"13" : "“It was either this or the Ice Capades,” he said. “I’ve made my movies. I’ve had two prime-time TV series. I’ve had eight books on your best-seller lists. I’ve done a lot of things with the internet. But I haven’t done this.”"

		"3" : "Mr. Hoffman began his career as a book editor at Hill and Wang, where he published gay and lesbian playwrights in the “New American Plays” series and in the 1979 anthology “Gay Plays: The First Collection.” In doing so, he promoted the careers of Jane Chambers, Tom Eyen, Joe Orton, Robert Patrick and Lanford Wilson, among others.",

Hoffman,” a regularly scheduled program in which he interviewed theatrical and musical personalities on the cable channel CUNY-TV.",

It was produced by the Glines, a gay theater company, in association with Circle Repertory, and moved two months later to Broadway, where it ran for 285 performances and was nominated for several Tony Awards, including best play. It won the 1985 Drama Desk and Obie Awards for outstanding new production.",

		"8" : "Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Hoffman had “found exactly the appropriate tone for his subject, a dramaturgical equivalent of the title of the play.”",

		"12" : "It had its premiere at the Met in 1991 — the first new opera performed there since 1967, and the first by either of the collaborators. With a cast that included Graham Clark, Renée Fleming, Marilyn Horne, Hakan Hagegard, Gino Quilico and Teresa Stratas, it was a critical sensation.",
		"13" : "Its central conceit: 200 years after the French Revolution, the playwright Beaumarchais is summoned to amuse the bored ghosts of the aristocrats who hover about the palace of Versailles and to use his drama to court the ghost of Marie Antoinette.",
		"14" : "“To me, the opera is primarily a love story, but it is also about the French Revolution, the nature of revolution in general, the nature of love, and the nature of time,” Mr. Hoffman said.",
		"15" : "Edward Rothstein wrote in The Times that “Ghosts” brought “camp humor, postmodern pastiche, parody and effulgent tonal nostalgia to the Met.”",

		"18" : "“I’m trying to detoxify our culture,” Mr. Hoffman told The Los Angeles Times. “This play, I hope, becomes a mirror” in which people see themselves and the hatred that surrounds them.”",

		"2" : "And when Fadwa Alaoui, 39, a Moroccan-born Canadian, tried to drive into Vermont for her monthly shopping trip, she faced questions about her religious beliefs and politics and gave up her phone to be searched, only to be turned away.",
		"3" : "“They treated us like criminals,” Ms. Alaoui said. “Like they have the right to do anything they want.”",
		"4" : "As his administration wades past the 100-day mark, President Trump’s efforts to bar travelers from several majority-Muslim countries and to eject immigrants without legal status have heartened many supporters and inflamed widespread dissent. But for those not subject to ban or deportation, it is in the sterile screening rooms of the country’s airports and border crossings — where Americans and foreigners alike can be held, searched and interrogated for hours — that everyday people are most likely to meet the machinery of Mr. Trump’s government.",
		"5" : "To judge by the chorus of travelers who have spoken out about a rough greeting at America’s doorstep, the customs experience is not helping Mr. Trump’s image.",
		"6" : "But not all the blame for soured airport experiences can be directed this president’s way. Customs and Border Protection officers had the same discretion to screen travelers under the Obama administration, when Muslims and other travelers said they routinely endured intrusive and even discriminatory treatment. At this stage, the data available about customs officers’ activities does not support the charge that many more travelers are facing extra scrutiny.",
		"7" : "Still, amid Mr. Trump’s attempts to harden American borders via wall, heightened vetting and a travel ban, the public is confronting a reality that went mostly unremarked in the past: In a country still struggling to define the balance between civil liberties and security nearly 16 years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, customs officers wield broad authority over the millions of people who knock on the United States’ 328 gates each year.",
		"8" : "In the limbo between leaving another country and arriving in this one, the officers have wide latitude to examine travelers, their baggage and their electronic devices while deciding whether to let them in. The rights that individuals, even citizens, are entitled to once inside the United States do not always apply while they are trying to enter it.",
		"9" : "“You may think you are in the United States, but for legal purposes, you aren’t until that inspector admits you,” said Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the government agency that evolved into the Department of Homeland Security after Sept. 11.",
		"10" : "The administration has not issued new directives about screening arriving passengers, and current and former government officials argue that many people are predisposed to see the worst in officers now that they work for Mr. Trump.",
		"11" : "“This is something that has always occurred,” said David Lapan, a Homeland Security spokesman. “The same things have happened under previous administrations.”",
		"12" : "Civil liberties advocates and immigration lawyers, however, say they believe individual officers are fueling a disturbing escalation of enforcement, made plain in the aggressive tone as well as the frequency of travelers’ encounters with them.",
		"13" : "“This is by no means an unprecedented thing,” said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. “But it does seem at this point like the reports we’re hearing are not just isolated reports, but they appear to be part of a trend. Either the word’s gotten out unofficially or officially that this treatment can be tolerated.”",
		"14" : "Customs inspections are routine: On a typical day in 2016, for instance, the agency denied admittance to 752 people at ports of entry and flagged 877 people deemed possible national security risks.",
		"15" : "Still, for many travelers, officers’ ability to examine their phones — and even request their pass codes — has made even ordinary stops into alarming and uncomfortably personal encounters. Even after travelers enter the country, the customs agency can keep their phones for weeks while investigators forensically peer into their contents.",
		"16" : "Electronic device searches were already on the rise under the Obama administration, with the number of travelers whose devices were searched more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. The monthly total of searches since Mr. Trump took office has remained roughly at the level that occurred during the last months of the Obama administration.",

		"19" : "After telling her to write down the pass code to her phone, a customs officer asked where she had been born (Morocco), how long she had lived in Canada (more than 20 years) and if she was a practicing Muslim (yes).",
		"20" : "The interrogation quickly veered further toward religious questions, Ms. Alaoui said. The officer asked about her mosque and its imam. He pulled up videos found on her phone, videos of Muslim prayers and Arabic jokes that had circulated among her friends and relatives on social media, and asked her to explain.",
		"21" : "Then he asked what she thought of Mr. Trump.",
		"22" : "“I said he can do whatever he wants in his country. It’s not my business. I just want to cross the border to go shopping. Why are you asking me this question?” recalled Ms. Alaoui, who wears a hijab.",
		"23" : "After they were photographed and fingerprinted, another officer told the women that they would not be allowed into the country because of the videos found on their phones.",
		"24" : "Muslims have spoken for years of facing heavy scrutiny from customs officers, accusing the agency of racial profiling. So have people who may be mistaken for Muslims. Shah Rukh Khan, the Indian actor known as the “King of Bollywood,” who is Muslim, has made headlines for being detained three times in seven years while traveling to the United States.",
		"25" : "The most prominent such incident in recent months occurred when Muhammad Ali Jr., the famed boxer’s son, was stopped by customs officers at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7. Mr. Ali, who had just arrived from a trip to Jamaica with his mother, said he had been led to a room where an officer asked how he had gotten his name and what his religion was.",
		"26" : "In an interview, Mr. Ali said the officer had told him that he shared a name with another person who had been flagged for extra screening. He had never had trouble entering the country before, he said.",
		"27" : "Officers have “an enormous amount of discretion” to question travelers, said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a head of civil rights and civil liberties at the Homeland Security Department under President Barack Obama. While Customs and Border Protection has an anti-discrimination rule, she said, the agency has not put significant limits on officers’ ability to ask about religious beliefs.",

		"29" : "After flying back to San Francisco from Belgium, where he had been showing some of his artwork, Aaron Gach, an American artist, was stopped and asked repeatedly to unlock his cellphone for an officer to search, he said. Mr. Gach, 43, said he had been asked a series of questions about his work, his travel arrangements and the art show. He was released only after complying with the request to unlock his phone.",
		"30" : "For noncitizens, formerly routine trips have turned fraught as travelers report encountering customs officers who question whether they are taking American jobs or being paid improperly.",
		"31" : "“We used to hear about these things once in a blue moon, and it would be the talk of the office,” said Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer in Tennessee. “Now people just basically roll their eyes because they’ve heard it so often.”",
		"32" : "There was the Australian children’s book author, Mem Fox, who was nearly denied entry on her way to give a speech in Milwaukee after being questioned about the $8,000 honorarium — standard for such speaking engagements — that she had accepted from the organizers.",
		"33" : "Ms. Fox, 71, who had traveled to the United States uneventfully more than 100 times in the past, characterized her questioning as “sadistic from the first moment,” though she was eventually allowed to continue on her way.",

		"35" : "Though she had made a similar trip in 2014, the explanation did not satisfy the officer, whom she said had told her, “If there are Americans that can do this job, then you are an illegal foreign worker.”",
		"36" : "Her three-hour detention at the Windsor-Detroit crossing culminated in a pat-down search by two female officers, who were so thorough that they even felt between her toes, Ms. O’Heany said.",

		"38" : "And there was Erik Hoeksema, whose group of about a dozen volunteers from a church in Ontario was stopped and turned back at the Buffalo crossing in March. They had been on their way to the Jersey Shore to help rebuild houses destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.",
		"39" : "No foreigners were allowed to do work for hire without visas, Mr. Hoeksema said he had been told. The fact that they were not going to be paid did not seem to make a difference.",
		"40" : "“We don’t know if we were mistreated, or we just made a mistake, or who knows?” Mr. Hoeksema said, adding that he has heard of other volunteer groups being denied entry in the past. “I just wish that you could just come to common sense and look at our group and consider that there still is a need for Sandy relief.”"

		"2" : "The Police Department in Balch Springs, Tex., said Sunday that the officer, whose name has not been released, fired on a car carrying the teenager, Jordan Edwards, a freshman at Mesquite High School in nearby Mesquite, Tex., because the car was reversing down a street toward the officer in an “aggressive manner.”",
		"3" : "But Jonathan Haber, the police chief, told reporters at a news conference on Monday afternoon that video showed the opposite. He said the officer fired when the car was “moving forward as the officers approached,” according to The Associated Press. The Dallas County medical examiner’s report ruled the death a homicide caused by a “rifle wound” to the head.",
		"4" : "Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, praised the police chief for his willingness to admit the department’s mistake and called the new account “a big deal.”",
		"5" : "“There were no weapons involved; there was no aggressive behavior; these were not suspects,” Mr. Merritt said in a telephone interview. “The lone motive they had for the murder was that the vehicle was being used as a weapon, and now that is no longer there.”",
		"6" : "Efforts to reach officials with the Police Department after Monday’s news conference were unsuccessful.",
		"7" : "But the department published an updated statement later on Monday that said the officers had been investigating a house party when they heard gunshots. When they went outside to investigate, they “confronted” a vehicle backing down the street that continued to reverse despite multiple commands to stop, the statement said.",
		"8" : "“The vehicle then pulled forward as the officer continued to approach the vehicle giving verbal commands. The vehicle continued the main roadway driving away from the officer as an officer shot into the vehicle striking the passenger,” the statement said.",
		"9" : "Mr. Merritt called the change in the department’s account “a hopeful sign” about the transparency of the investigation, but he said the authorities needed to do more.",
		"10" : "“They have a dead child, they have the identity of the shooter, and they have no explanation for the shooting,” Mr. Merritt said. “They have more than sufficient probable cause to make an arrest.”",
		"11" : "Jordan, a popular football player, was killed shortly after leaving a party with a group of friends on Saturday night. The police said in a statement on Sunday that officers were in the area responding to a 911 call complaining about drunken young people.",
		"12" : "The initial statement had said officers fired on the car after they heard gunfire from an “unknown altercation.” Jordan, a passenger, was shot in the head and later died from his injuries at a hospital.",
		"13" : "The shooting has unnerved Balch Springs, a city of about 23,000 people that lies about 15 miles east of downtown Dallas. The Mesquite Independent School District said Mr. Edwards “was a good student who was very well liked by his teachers, coaches and his fellow students.”",
		"14" : "“The entire district — especially the staff and students of Mesquite High School — are mourning this terrible loss,” the district said.",
		"15" : "Local media reported on what the death of the teenager meant to the community.",

		"18" : "Mr. Merritt, the lawyer, said in remarks published by the Dallas Morning News on Monday, “We’ve heard excuses before in the past: You know why it happens, because the dads aren’t present. That excuse isn’t here. Or the kid was violent. That excuse isn’t present here.”",
		"19" : "The first day of spring football practice at Mesquite High School was canceled on Monday because of Jordan’s death.",

		"21" : "“I met Jordan on Day 1 and learned his name very quickly just because of the type of kid he was,” Mr. Fleener said.",
		"22" : "Jordan, who weighed 150 pounds and was nearly six feet tall, was a committed athlete who was often seen either working out in the weight room or surrounded by the camaraderie of teammates in the locker room and on the field. He had aspirations to play college football and was trying out for the team’s defensive position, Mr. Fleener said.",
		"23" : "Jordan “spent a lot of time in the weight room to make himself better, bigger and stronger,” Mr. Fleener said. “The big thing is he was not scared to come hit somebody on the football field. Off the field, his big smile lit up a room, but he knew how to flip that switch on the field and play with some physicality.”",
		"24" : "“He was everybody’s friend — his attitude and smile, everything was just contagious about him. He was excellent — 3.5 G.P.A., never in trouble, no attendance issues,” Mr. Fleener said. “He was a kid that did everything right.”",
		"25" : "Officer Pedro Gonzalez, a police spokesman, said in a brief phone interview early Monday that the officers involved in the episode had been wearing body cameras. Mr. Gonzalez said they would be interviewed after they had been given a chance to “decompress.”",

The police blamed anarchist groups — which have disrupted other protests since the election — for destroying a police car, attacking officers, damaging windows and starting fires. More than two dozen people were arrested.",
		"7" : "But most of the day’s events were peaceful. In Grand Rapids, Mich., more than 4,000 people — twice the number of people who sat out jobs and school days in Grand Rapids on February’s nationwide “Day Without Immigrants” — had turned out in the rain by midafternoon, closing large sections of the city’s Latino community. Bakeries, markets, restaurants and clothing stores had shuttered for the day out of solidarity or for lack of workers.",

		"2" : "It was an outcome that should worry the new president even though Mr. Trump will be spared the humiliation of a government shutdown early in his tenure if he signs the legislation.",
		"3" : "“We were sort of a united front, Republicans and Democrats, opposed to Trump,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in an interview.",

Members of both parties, freed to direct money to favored initiatives, eagerly seized the opportunity and increased funding for agencies such as the National Institutes of Health rather than cutting it.",

		"8" : "Democrats were in a celebratory mood, issuing news releases highlighting pet projects included in the measure to be voted on this week. “Omnibus Bill Reflects Democrats’ Values to Protect Health Care, Environment and Education,” read the headline on a letter from Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader.",
		"9" : "Republicans, perhaps in no rush to stick their thumb in the eye of a president known for his itchy Twitter finger, were more restrained. But many are not enthusiastic about the border wall, and there was plenty in the 1,665-page bill for them to like, such as an increase in Pentagon spending and more money to reduce the opioid addiction plaguing many of their states.",
		"10" : "Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, professed particular satisfaction at a permanent extension of health benefits for retired coal miners and assistance for communities and workers hit by the downturn in coal mining. The deal was exactly the sort of something-for-everyone grab bag that used to be a standard feature of Congress before the breakdown in passing the annual spending bills.",
		"11" : "Most of the displeasure with the legislation was being expressed off Capitol Hill by conservative groups that found it a rank capitulation to Democrats and Trump opponents.",
		"12" : "“The late-night closed-door budget deal provides no funding for President Trump’s signature promise of a border wall,” said Bob Dane, the executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. “Other provisions of the budget deal effectively sell out the very people who delivered key swing states to him last November.”",
		"13" : "At the White House, Sean Spicer, the spokesman, played down any defeats for the White House and said the president’s priorities would be better reflected in the coming budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. He portrayed new border security funding included in the current budget deal as a step toward constructing the wall.",
		"14" : "“Make no mistake: The wall will be built,” he said.",
		"15" : "But this budget deal made it abundantly clear that Democrats retain real leverage on spending because of the Senate filibuster. Getting them to go along with the funding for the wall probably will not get any easier in the next budget. Mr. Trump himself expressed new frustration with the Senate in an interview aired Sunday by CBS’s “Face the Nation.”",
		"16" : "“I think the rules in Congress, and in particular the rules in the Senate, are unbelievably archaic and slow-moving and, in many cases, unfair,” he said. “In many cases, you’re forced to make deals that are not the deal you’d make. You’d make a much different kind of a deal.”",
		"17" : "But after the Senate just changed procedure to ban filibusters against Supreme Court nominees, it is unlikely senators will be in a hurry to institute an even more sweeping change to gut the legislative filibuster that instills individual senators with greater power — especially to win money for a wall many of them don’t want.",
		"18" : "Instead, members of the House and Senate now have clear evidence they can successfully work together in certain cases and deliver a product they support even if it does not do all that the White House wants. It could serve as a template for putting together the next round of spending bills.",
		"19" : "“This gives me a great deal of optimism about getting a full-year budget for 2018 if we follow this pattern,” Mr. Schumer said.",
		"20" : "After Mr. Trump’s election, some Republicans feared that the new president might be too willing to work with Democrats at the expense of Republicans. But the spending deal showed that it might be pragmatic Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who are occasionally willing to get together — and that union could come at a cost to the president."

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are increasingly resigned to a strategy of hammering through tax overhaul legislation by themselves, without the Democrats, reprising the approach that has failed them in their efforts to pass a new health law.",
		"2" : "After House Republicans were unable to gather enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in March, President Trump suggested that he would consider making a deal with Democrats, potentially by lumping tax and infrastructure legislation into a giant jobs package. But as Mr. Trump crossed the 100-day benchmark he set for his presidency, it was clear that he is preparing to work solely with Republicans on the first rewriting of the tax code in 30 years.",
		"3" : "At a Milken Institute conference Monday in California, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Mr. Trump had abandoned the idea of combining the issues legislatively. “We’ve talked about putting infrastructure and tax together, I think we’re probably not going to do that,” Mr. Mnuchin said.",
		"4" : "Mr. Mnuchin also said the administration was designing a tax plan that would fit the Senate’s budget reconciliation rules, which require only a simple majority to pass.",
		"5" : "A senior administration official said last week that Democrats had shown no interest in working with Mr. Trump and that trying to create a bipartisan tax bill would quite likely waste months of precious time. The official also suggested that the Senate’s reconciliation rules could be changed so that tax legislation that adds to the deficit could extend beyond 10 years. Current rules dictate that budgetary changes passed with a simple majority, rather than 60 voters, expire after a decade.",
		"6" : "Mr. Trump complained about the Senate rules in an interview on CBS on Sunday, suggesting that he would like to see changes that would reduce the ability of Democrats to block his agenda. “I think the rules in Congress, and in particular the rules in the Senate, are unbelievably archaic and slow moving and, in many cases, unfair,” Mr. Trump said. “In many cases, you’re forced to make deals that are not the deal you’d make.”",
		"7" : "Some Republicans also appear ready to manipulate longstanding policies. As The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania has suggested that Senate Republicans consider extending the 10-year horizon so that tax cuts that add to the deficit could remain for two or three decades before expiring. Kasia Mulligan, a spokeswoman for Mr. Toomey, said it would require only a simple majority to make such a change.",
		"8" : "For now, Republicans are having a hard enough time getting on the same page on how they want to change the tax code. Mr. Mnuchin said on Monday that the White House and House Republicans were 80 percent aligned in terms of the shape of tax legislation. He said that in its current form, the “border adjustment” tax on imports proposed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan is not workable but that he had been meeting weekly with Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to come up with compromises on a tax plan.",
		"9" : "At a weekend policy retreat, Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee mulled ways to merge their tax “blueprint” with the principles put forth by the White House. The committee will hold tax overhaul hearings this month and, despite the resistance from the Trump administration, the border adjustment tax will be the subject of public debate.",
		"10" : "“There’s a great deal of energy and a great deal of momentum,” said Representative Peter Roskam, the committee’s tax policy chairman. “The concept now is get these themes together and get everybody on the same page.”",
		"11" : "Despite those efforts, Mr. Trump’s views on tax policy remain something of a moving target. In an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, the president said a gasoline tax that would be used to fund highway projects was “something that I would certainly consider.”",
		"12" : "The remark appeared to contradict Mr. Mnuchin’s earlier assessment that tax-code overhaul and infrastructure would be handled separately. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, tried to walk the idea back later in the day.",
		"13" : "“There are people on both sides of the aisle, different backgrounds, that come in to see the president and ask him, could you please consider this, will you keep an open mind on it,” Mr. Spicer said. “And I think that’s, frankly, what the president was doing.”"

		"5" : "Justices who do not participate, by contrast, have their law clerks review all of the roughly 7,000 petitions filed each year, looking for the 75 or so worthy of the court’s attention.",
		"6" : "The pool has been criticized for giving too much power to law clerks and for contributing to the court’s shrinking docket.",
		"7" : "For almost two decades until 2008, only Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010, stayed out of the pool. He said it had caused “the lessening of the docket.”",

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took aim Monday at two signature programs of the former first lady Michelle Obama, rolling back her efforts to promote healthy school lunches nationwide and potentially rebranding her program to educate adolescent girls abroad.",
		"2" : "Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that school meals would no longer have to meet some requirements connected with Mrs. Obama’s initiative to combat childhood obesity by overhauling the nation’s school menus.",
		"3" : "The nutrition regulations were part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and were advocated by Mrs. Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign. For the last five years, schools have been required to reduce the amount of calories, fat and sodium in their cafeterias and increase offerings of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nonfat milk to the roughly 32 million students who receive federally subsidized meals.",
		"4" : "Beginning next school year, schools can request an exemption from the whole grain requirements and delay the sodium mandate. They will also be able to serve 1 percent flavored milk instead of nonfat.",
		"5" : "Mr. Perdue said the Obama-era rules had resulted in increased costs for school districts and declining participation in the federal school lunch program. He said relaxing the rules was part of the administration’s effort to “make school meals great again.”",
		"6" : "“If kids aren’t eating the food, and it’s ending up in the trash, they aren’t getting any nutrition — thus undermining the intent of the program,” said Mr. Perdue, who announced the changes with a signed proclamation on Monday after having lunch with students at Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg, Va. Mr. Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, was just confirmed last week.",
		"7" : "Nutrition advocates said the move by the Trump administration was shortsighted.",
		"8" : "“Just because children would rather eat heavily salted, processed foods at school doesn’t mean they should,” said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group. “The president’s fondness for Big Macs and KFC is well known, but we shouldn’t let Colonel Sanders and McDonald’s run the school cafeteria.”",
		"9" : "Since schools began complying with the nutrition standards in 2012, many have complained that they are too stringent and costly. The new rules were projected to cost $3.2 billion over five years, but Mr. Perdue said they had cost states an additional $1.22 billion in the 2015 fiscal year alone.",
		"10" : "Congress has allowed states to apply for waivers if they cannot meet certain standards.",
		"11" : "Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, said in a statement that schools were moving forward to meet the requirements. The organization denounced the Agriculture Department’s relaxation of the rules, noting that more sodium and sugar would increase students’ blood pressure and put them at greater risk of heart disease and strokes.",
		"12" : "Ms. Brown said her organization was “very disappointed that the U.S.D.A. has decided to put special interests back on the school menu,” and added, “We strongly urge the agency and Congress not to give politics priority over the health of our children.”",
		"13" : "Last month, Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who leads the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, asked Mr. Perdue to have the Agriculture Department provide “immediate relief” from the regulations, some of which were to take effect July 1. On Monday, Mr. Roberts accompanied Mr. Perdue in his announcement, which coincided with the start of School Nutrition Employee Week.",
		"14" : "Representatives of the national School Nutrition Association cheered the regulatory rollback. “We have been wanting flexibility so that schools can serve meals that are both nutritious and palatable,” said the group’s chief executive, Patricia Montague.",
		"15" : "This flexibility will be welcomed in at least one part of the country, Mr. Perdue said.",
		"16" : "“A perfect example is in the South, where the schools want to serve grits,” he said. “But the whole grain variety has little black flakes in it, and the kids won’t eat it. The school is compliant with the whole grain requirements, but no one is eating the grits. That doesn’t make any sense.”",
		"17" : "The Trump administration also indicated on Monday that it was eyeing another program Mrs. Obama promoted.",
		"18" : "It was not clear how serious the administration was about targeting the program, Let Girls Learn, which was spearheaded by President Barack Obama and Mrs. Obama in 2015 to increase educational opportunities for adolescent girls who face physical danger and other obstacles to going to school.",
		"19" : "In a letter circulated internally this week, a Peace Corps official said the initiative would no longer use the Let Girls Learn brand or operate as a discrete program, according to people familiar with the document, which was first reported by CNN.",
		"20" : "A senior administration official said there was no plan to end or even rebrand the program, calling the letter a result of an unauthorized and erroneous decision by a career government employee. When Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s staff learned of the memo on Monday, they insisted that it be reviewed, said the official, who discussed private deliberations on the condition of anonymity.",
		"21" : "R. C. Hammond, Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, declined to answer questions, providing only a terse statement that said, “No changes have been made to the Let Girls Learn program.” He referred additional queries to the Peace Corps, which did not return phone calls and emails seeking comment.",
		"22" : "But former officials expressed alarm that members of Mr. Trump’s administration would even consider trying to redefine an initiative that gained traction, and its name, under Mrs. Obama’s stewardship after the world reacted with outrage to the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria by the Boko Haram terrorist group.",
		"23" : "“If this administration wants to move in a different direction on girls’ education, that’s certainly their right and understandable, but to tear down a message that was erected in the wake of this terrible incident that happened in Nigeria, and that the world rallied around, I think it is really shameful,” said Brett Plitt Bruen, an Obama administration official who helped create the program.",

		"25" : "“It was effective before the first lady got involved, and it became even more powerful when her brand and her office were associated with it,” Mr. Bruen said. “And to say we’re going to stop the campaign or change it just to distance it from her is to undermine everything that was achieved.”"

And it is likely to provide relief to those who have borne the brunt of the effort — if only for the next five months, when the current fiscal year ends.",
		"5" : "The Secret Service has been particularly strained as it tries to keep up with its new protectees, who include a first lady and a son living at Trump Tower and Mr. Trump’s frequently traveling adult children. The agency had requested additional money earlier this year.",
		"6" : "The legislation provides the Secret Service with $34 million for the increased cost of physical protection of Mr. Trump for the rest of the fiscal year. The money could be used flexibly to protect the first family in New York and when it travels. The family’s travels, from business trips to Vancouver and Dubai by Mr. Trump’s adult sons to ski weekends in Aspen, Colo., and Whistler, British Columbia, by his daughter Ivanka have become a constant point of criticism among Democrats.",
		"7" : "Another $23 million would go specifically toward covering the costs of outfitting Trump Tower with the necessary equipment and personnel, as well as to rent space inside the building for agency personnel, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who was familiar with the funding bill but was not yet authorized to discuss it. Mr. Trump has not returned to the tower, his primary residence and the corporate headquarters of the Trump Organization, since Inauguration Day, but his wife, Melania, and son Barron have been living there full time.",

Among them are $50 million for the installation of long-awaited White House fence segments intended to improve security at the Executive Mansion and $13 million to make overtime payments incurred during last year’s presidential campaign.",
		"9" : "In total, the Secret Service spends more than $750 million of its $1.8 billion budget on protective operations. That includes not only protection of the White House compound, Mr. Trump, his family and other current and former top government officials, but also security for visiting foreign dignitaries and the United Nations General Assembly each year.",
		"10" : "The agency declined to comment on the legislation.",
		"11" : "Aside from the Secret Service, the biggest beneficiaries under the agreement would be New York City and Palm Beach County, where Mr. Trump and his family have spent the bulk of their time away from Washington since Election Day. Bedminster, N.J., where Mr. Trump owns another golf club and is expected to spend time in the coming weeks and months, would also be eligible to apply for the funds.",
		"12" : "Congress had previously approved $7 million to reimburse local law enforcement for the costs of protecting Mr. Trump between Election Day and the inauguration. The new agreement will provide that money, plus $20 million for the same period and $41 million for the period from Jan. 20 until the end of the fiscal year.",
		"13" : "“Although the federal government does not otherwise reimburse costs of state or local law enforcement for activities in support of the United States Secret Service protection mission,” the legislation reads, “these funds are being provided in recognition of the extraordinary costs borne by a small number of jurisdictions in which a residence of the president is located.”",
		"14" : "More than 100 days into Mr. Trump’s presidency, those jurisdictions said they have yet to see any federal money and are still awaiting instructions on how to apply for the bulk of the reimbursement.",
		"15" : "New York City has shouldered the heaviest cost since Mr. Trump was elected. James P. O’Neill, the police commissioner, wrote in a letter in February to the state’s congressional delegation that the Police Department had spent $300,000 a day protecting Trump Tower between Election Day and Inauguration Day and $127,000 to $145,000 a day since then, on top of other costs.",
		"16" : "In Florida, home to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office has said it was spending an additional $60,000 a day in overtime when Mr. Trump was in town. He has visited seven times since Inauguration Day, spending a total of 25 days there.",

It is unclear if Mr. Trump will stay at his Trump Tower triplex or return to Bedminster, which is likely to become a more frequent presidential retreat as the weather warms.",

		"1" : "When Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. visited Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute last month, he was asked a startling question, one with overtones of science fiction.",
		"2" : "“Can you foresee a day,” asked Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the college in upstate New York, “when smart machines, driven with artificial intelligences, will assist with courtroom fact-finding or, more controversially even, judicial decision-making?”",
		"3" : "The chief justice’s answer was more surprising than the question. “It’s a day that’s here,” he said, “and it’s putting a significant strain on how the judiciary goes about doing things.”",
		"4" : "He may have been thinking about the case of a Wisconsin man, Eric L. Loomis, who was sentenced to six years in prison based in part on a private company’s proprietary software. Mr. Loomis says his right to due process was violated by a judge’s consideration of a report generated by the software’s secret algorithm, one Mr. Loomis was unable to inspect or challenge.",
		"5" : "In March, in a signal that the justices were intrigued by Mr. Loomis’s case, they asked the federal government to file a friend-of-the-court brief offering its views on whether the court should hear his appeal.",
		"6" : "The report in Mr. Loomis’s case was produced by a product called Compas, sold by Northpointe Inc. It included a series of bar charts that assessed the risk that Mr. Loomis would commit more crimes.",
		"7" : "The Compas report, a prosecutor told the trial judge, showed “a high risk of violence, high risk of recidivism, high pretrial risk.” The judge agreed, telling Mr. Loomis that “you’re identified, through the Compas assessment, as an individual who is a high risk to the community.”",
		"8" : "The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Loomis. The report added valuable information, it said, and Mr. Loomis would have gotten the same sentence based solely on the usual factors, including his crime — fleeing the police in a car — and his criminal history.",
		"9" : "At the same time, the court seemed uneasy with using a secret algorithm to send a man to prison. Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, writing for the court, discussed, for instance, a report from ProPublica about Compas that concluded that black defendants in Broward County, Fla., “were far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher rate of recidivism.”",
		"10" : "Justice Bradley noted that Northpointe had disputed the analysis. Still, she wrote, “this study and others raise concerns regarding how a Compas assessment’s risk factors correlate with race.”",
		"11" : "In the end, though, Justice Bradley allowed sentencing judges to use Compas. They must take account of the algorithm’s limitations and the secrecy surrounding it, she wrote, but said the software could be helpful “in providing the sentencing court with as much information as possible in order to arrive at an individualized sentence.”",
		"12" : "Justice Bradley made Compas’s role in sentencing sound like the consideration of race in a selective university’s holistic admissions program. It could be one factor among many, she wrote, but not the determinative one.",
		"13" : "In urging the United States Supreme Court not to hear the case, Wisconsin’s attorney general, Brad D. Schimel, seemed to acknowledge that the questions in the case were substantial ones. But he said the justices should not move too fast.",
		"14" : "“The use of risk assessments by sentencing courts is a novel issue, which needs time for further percolation,” Mr. Schimel wrote.",
		"15" : "He added that Mr. Loomis “was free to question the assessment and explain its possible flaws.” But it is a little hard to see how he could do that without access to the algorithm itself.",
		"16" : "The company that markets Compas says its formula is a trade secret.",
		"17" : "“The key to our product is the algorithms, and they’re proprietary,” one of its executives said last year. “We’ve created them, and we don’t release them because it’s certainly a core piece of our business.”",
		"18" : "Compas and other products with similar algorithms play a role in many states’ criminal justice systems. “These proprietary techniques are used to set bail, determine sentences, and even contribute to determinations about guilt or innocence,” a report from the Electronic Privacy Information Center found. “Yet the inner workings of these tools are largely hidden from public view.”",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Miami can sue two banks for predatory lending under the Fair Housing Act of 1968.",
		"2" : "The case arose from the 2008 financial crisis. Miami sued Bank of America and Wells Fargo, saying that their discriminatory mortgage lending practices had led to a disproportionate number of defaults by minority home buyers and, in turn, to financial harm to the city.",
		"3" : "Even as the majority of justices ruled that Miami was entitled to sue under the housing law, the court declined to decide whether the city had asserted a direct enough connection between the banks’ actions and the harm it claimed. The court sent the case back to the federal appeals court in Atlanta for further exploration of that question.",
		"4" : "When the case was argued in the Supreme Court in November, it seemed headed for a 4-4 tie. But the vote on the question of whether Miami could sue under the law was 5 to 3, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the court’s four-member liberal bloc to form a majority.",
		"5" : "Miami said the banks had intentionally and disproportionately issued risky mortgages on unfavorable terms to black and Hispanic borrowers. That led, the city said, to segregation and foreclosures, hurting its property tax base and requiring it to provide additional municipal services.",
		"6" : "A trial court dismissed the suits in 2014, saying the city had not demonstrated that its claims were covered by the housing law. The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, reversed those rulings in 2015, allowing the cases to proceed. The appeals court said it was enough for the city to contend that it had “suffered an economic injury resulting from a racially discriminatory housing policy.”",
		"7" : "Writing for the majority on Monday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Congress had meant to include cities among the “aggrieved” persons who may sue under the housing law. He said a 1979 Supreme Court decision, Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, supported the ruling.",
		"8" : "In that case, he said, a village had been allowed to sue on the theory that it had “lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by racial-steering practices.” In the Miami case, Justice Breyer wrote, the city had similarly asserted that the banks’ actions had “reduced property values, diminishing the city’s property-tax revenue and increasing demand for municipal services.”",
		"9" : "In a second part of his opinion, Justice Breyer wrote that the appeals court had used too lax a standard in assessing the connection between the banks’ conduct and the city’s asserted injuries. The appeals court had ruled that injuries had only to be foreseeable, but Justice Breyer said that was too attenuated.",
		"10" : "“The housing market is interconnected with economic and social life,” Justice Breyer wrote, and violations of the housing law always have ripples.",
		"11" : "“Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a remedy wherever those ripples travel,” he wrote.",
		"12" : "Instead, he said, there must be a direct relationship between the challenged conduct and the asserted injury. He left it up the appeals court to re-examine that question.",
		"13" : "In addition to Chief Justice Roberts, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority decision.",
		"14" : "In a partial dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said there was nothing in the housing law to suggest that “Congress was concerned about decreased property values, foreclosures and urban blight, much less about strains on municipal budgets that might follow.”",
		"15" : "When the case was argued, some justices worried that a ruling for Miami would allow all sorts of people and entities to sue for indirect harm from discriminatory practices. Justice Kagan asked about restaurants and dry cleaners, Justice Sotomayor about corner grocers and Justice Breyer about publishers.",
		"16" : "The majority did not directly address whether those kinds of suits were allowed under the law. Justice Thomas welcomed that aspect of the ruling, saying, “It should not be read to authorize suits by local businesses alleging the same injuries that Miami alleges here.”",
		"17" : "Justice Thomas said the city should also lose on the question of causation. “Miami’s asserted injuries are too remote from the injurious conduct it has alleged,” he wrote.",
		"18" : "Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined the partial dissent. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch did not participate in the decision.",
		"19" : "The court’s decision in the two consolidated cases, Bank of America v. Miami, No. 15-1111, and Wells Fargo v. Miami, No. 15-1112, was limited. But it nonetheless meant that civil rights groups had for a second time in two years avoided a complete loss in a Fair Housing Act case by a narrow margin.",
		"20" : "In 2015, in a 5-to-4 decision, the court allowed plaintiffs in Fair Housing Act cases to use a legal theory that civil rights groups had said was a crucial tool to fight discrimination. The majority ruled that plaintiffs could use statistical evidence to prove that the challenged practice had produced a “disparate impact.”"

	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/top-ethics-officer-challenges-trump-over-secret-waivers-for-ex-lobbyists.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — The federal government’s top ethics officer is challenging the Trump administration’s issuance of secret waivers that allow former lobbyists to handle matters they recently worked on, setting up a confrontation between the ethics office and President Trump.",
		"2" : "The move by Walter M. Shaub Jr., the director of the Office of Government Ethics, is the latest sign of rising tension between Mr. Shaub and the Trump White House. Mr. Shaub has tried several times to use his limited powers to force Mr. Trump to broadly honor federal ethics rules as well as the ethics order that Mr. Trump himself signed in late January.",
		"3" : "Historically, the Office of Government Ethics — a tiny operation that has just 71 employees but that supervises an ethics program covering 2.7 million civilian executive branch workers — has maintained a low profile. Created in 1978 after the Watergate scandal, it does not have subpoena power or its own investigators.",
		"4" : "But Mr. Shaub, in the last year of a five-year presidential appointment, is now pressing Mr. Trump for more information on former lobbyists or employees of corporations working in the president’s administration. The effort started before Inauguration Day to persuade Mr. Trump and his staff to comply with more conventional ethics standards used during the Obama and George W. Bush administrations.",
		"5" : "The most recent request came late Friday, when Mr. Shaub asked every executive branch agency — including the White House — to give him, by June 1, a copy of any waivers issued to political employees allowing them to ignore any part of the executive branch’s ethics policies, saying in his letter that he was “advancing the mission of the executive branch ethics program.”",
		"6" : "Such waivers are typically issued when the administration wants to allow a new political employee to work on an issue, like federal housing or environmental policy, that involves people the new employee may have worked with previously. For example, Ernest J. Moniz, the energy secretary in the Obama administration, was allowed to work on matters that involved General Electric, even though Mr. Moniz, as a nuclear physicist, had served on a General Electric advisory board. About 70 such waivers were issued during the Obama administration.",
		"7" : "Mr. Trump, in his ethics order, made several fundamental changes in this process, some of which Mr. Shaub is challenging.",
		"8" : "First, Mr. Trump eliminated a prohibition imposed by President Barack Obama in 2009 on the hiring of staff members who in the previous two years had lobbied the agency they now wanted to work for. Former lobbyists seeking jobs in Mr. Trump’s administration must get a waiver from the ethics rules if they want to work on matters that overlap with their lobbying assignments in the previous two years.",
		"9" : "But Mr. Trump has chosen to keep the waivers secret. He dropped a practice, in place during the Obama administration, that any waiver would be shared with the Office of Government Ethics and posted on the White House website or the ethics office’s website, or on both.",
		"10" : "The combined result — eliminating the ban on hiring former lobbyists and keeping secret any waivers granted to new hires — means the public has no way of knowing if Mr. Trump’s staff members are complying with the rules. Terminating the release of the White House visitor logs, which were public during the Obama administration, has made evaluating compliance even harder, as it is now not known which private-sector players are meeting with White House aides.",
		"11" : "For example, Michael Catanzaro, who until recently worked as a lobbyist for companies like Devon Energy and for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, is now in charge of White House environmental policy, an issue related to the topics he handled as a lobbyist. He may or may not have been granted a waiver by the White House. A White House spokeswoman declined to say.",
		"12" : "The White House, in a written statement, said officials were reviewing Mr. Shaub’s request and had not decided how to respond.",
		"13" : "“However, in the meantime we would like to reiterate our position that the White House and the White House Ethics Office are fully compliant with ethical obligations set forth in the standards of conduct,” the statement said. “Anyone that claims otherwise is purposefully mischaracterizing the White House’s position.”",
		"14" : "Mr. Shaub has tried to at least force the White House to make any waivers public. He is doing so by using his power to issue a “data call” for copies of all waivers issued in the last year. That would include the final months of the Obama administration and the first four months of the Trump administration.",
		"15" : "He has quietly escalated his battle with the White House. A second letter he sent late last week to the top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee also made clear that the ethics office intends to make a similar request early next year that will cover all such waivers granted in 2017.",
		"16" : "Mr. Shaub made headlines when he authorized his staff to publish a series of Twitter posts in December related to how Mr. Trump would separate himself from his family business operations. Then, in January, in an unusual public statement, Mr. Shaub called Mr. Trump’s steps “wholly inadequate,” even though Mr. Shaub did not have the power to order Mr. Trump to take additional steps.",
		"17" : "The White House has pushed back at Mr. Shaub. A letter sent in late February by Stefan C. Passantino, the top White House ethics lawyer, argued that Mr. Shaub does not have jurisdiction over the White House staff at all because the White House is not formally a federal agency.",
		"18" : "Mr. Shaub  wrote back bluntly to Mr. Passantino in March: “That assertion is incorrect, and the letter cites no legal basis for it.”",
		"19" : "Mr. Shaub’s data call will test this dispute. He appears to have clear authority to order the leaders of federal agencies to provide him with a copy of all ethics waivers granted in the last year. But he may not be able to force the White House to provide similar information, even if Democrats in Congress join in urging the White House to respond to the request, which is likely.",
		"20" : "Posting these waivers in a public place provides a degree of confirmation that the executive branch is honoring the ethics agreement. Anytime Mr. Obama wanted to make an exception, said Norman L. Eisen, an ethics lawyer in the Obama White House, it needed to be explained in detail in a letter from the head of the agency and then made available for public inspection. “We were committed to transparency, even when it was painful,” Mr. Eisen said. “And at times the debate about these waivers was not fun for us.”",
		"21" : "In fact, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, in a letter to Office of Government Ethics in 2009, pressed the Obama administration to ensure that it was disclosing all such waivers, explaining that “the American people deserve a full accounting of all waivers and recusals to better understand who is running the government and whether the administration is adhering to its promise to be open, transparent, and accountable.”"

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump marked his first 100 days in office by attacking the news media with a calculated fury not seen since the beginning of his administration — while rewarding the journalists he allegedly loathes with long, newsy chats in the Oval Office, Air Force One rides and meals.",
		"2" : "Mr. Trump’s split-personality approach to the press was on particular display on Saturday, when he skipped the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner to blast the news media in front of a friendly rally audience in Harrisburg, Pa., and then sat down with John Dickerson, host of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” for a wide-ranging conversation.",
		"3" : "The interview was the capstone of a frenetic period in which Mr. Trump sat for interviews with representatives of the very media he has publicly criticized and dispatched his top advisers to provide virtually nonstop briefings for them. The president and his aides made the case that he had accomplished significant things since taking office, despite Mr. Trump’s lack of major legislative achievements.",
		"4" : "In his interview with Mr. Dickerson, the president veered from sales mode to sullen defiance. The first part, which aired on Sunday, was all sales. The second part, which aired on Monday, ended when Mr. Trump walked away abruptly after Mr. Dickerson pressed him on his false claim, expressed on Twitter, that President Barack Obama had placed a “tap” on Trump Tower.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump said that while the former president had been “very nice to me,” the two have had “difficulties.”",
		"6" : "“You saw what happened with surveillance,” Mr. Trump said, declining to elaborate. Asked by Mr. Dickerson, “What does that mean, sir?” Mr. Trump said, “You can figure that out yourself.”",
		"7" : "When Mr. Dickerson asked whether Mr. Trump stood by his characterization of Mr. Obama as “sick and bad,” the president appeared to become agitated and said, “You can take it any way you want.”",
		"8" : "“I have my own opinions,” Mr. Trump continued, as Mr. Dickerson tried in vain to ask him for an explanation. “You can have your own opinions.”",
		"9" : "The president then ended the interview, saying, “O.K., it’s enough.”",
		"10" : "Congressional investigators from both parties have said they have uncovered no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claims. But congressional Republicans and White House officials have said that some communications of Mr. Trump’s associates were picked up as part of routine surveillance conducted by American intelligence agencies.",
		"11" : "The testy exchange was at odds with the image of competence and message discipline White House officials have labored to show over the past week, as they have tried to demonstrate progress around Mr. Trump’s 100-day mark, a time frame the president rejected as ridiculous but has gone out of his way to frame as an unparalleled success.",
		"12" : "While he takes pains to hide it from his supporters, Mr. Trump’s public churl is often followed by private charm. Shortly after cutting short the interview on Saturday, Mr. Dickerson flew with the president on Air Force One and then had dinner with him, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction.",
		"13" : "“I love your show,” he said sarcastically to Mr. Dickerson at one point in the interview. “I call it ‘Deface the Nation.’”",
		"14" : "On Monday, the White House reverted to a less subtle way of delivering its message, releasing a campaign advertisement declaring his administration’s beginning a triumph, and questioning the way the press has covered him.",
		"15" : "The 30-second television ad and a series of more targeted versions that are to run online were the latest examples of Mr. Trump’s extraordinarily early return to campaigning at a point when most presidents would be spending their time pushing through their highest legislative priorities.",
		"16" : "“America has rarely seen such success,” the narrator says in the ad, listing the confirmation of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, companies investing in jobs in the United States, the elimination of “regulations that kill American jobs” and the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.",
		"17" : "“You wouldn’t know it from watching the news,” the narrator adds, showing the faces of anchors for mainstream news broadcasters as the words “FAKE NEWS” flash across the screen in large red letters.",
		"18" : "The ad also mentions “the biggest tax cut plan in history,” without mentioning that Mr. Trump has yet to offer any legislation — or even a set of policy prescriptions — for reordering the tax code to achieve the enormous cuts for businesses and individuals that he has endorsed.",
		"19" : "It also does not mention Mr. Trump’s failed attempt to push through a health care overhaul, after having vowed that the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act would be his earliest priority. Nor is there any reference to his attempts to crack down on illegal immigration, which have largely stalled.",
		"20" : "Congress has refused to provide any money for the border wall that was his most talked-about campaign promise, and courts have blocked two of his efforts to bar travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries and to defund so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to help the federal authorities track and deport illegal immigrants.",
		"21" : "The TV advertisement was paid for by Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, for which he filed papers in January, on the day he was sworn in. The campaign said it would spend $1.5 million to air the ad across the country, a relatively small sum that does not indicate a major national public relations offensive.",
		"22" : "But airing the ad underscored Mr. Trump’s remarkably early return to partisan politics, a strategy that has included a series of re-election campaign rallies that began only weeks into his presidency.",
		"23" : "The latest such gathering was in Harrisburg, timed to coincide with the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.",
		"24" : "Yet even as he gleefully snubbed it, Mr. Trump offered an exclusive interview to the association’s president, Jeff Mason of Reuters. It was arguably the most telling of the dozen or so sit-downs the president conducted.",

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — After two false starts on President Trump’s promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump administration officials ratcheted up pressure on the House on Monday to vote on a revised version of the Republican repeal bill this week, even as support may actually be eroding.",
		"2" : "The president complicated his pitch with a jumble of statements that indicated he did not fully understand the content of the measure he was pushing. He insisted that the repeal bill would protect Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, as the Affordable Care Act does. But a host of medical groups and disease advocacy organizations said it would not.",
		"3" : "“I want it to be good for sick people,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “It’s not in its final form right now. It will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.”",
		"4" : "Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, said on Monday: “I have always stated that one of the few good things about Obamacare is that people with pre-existing conditions would be covered.” The Republicans’ latest version “strips away any guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered and affordable,” he said.",
		"5" : "Still promising that the votes would come, senior White House officials pressed on. Vice President Mike Pence headed to Capitol Hill on Monday evening to twist the arms of Republicans while the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, sent texts to wavering members.",
		"6" : "“We’re getting closer and closer every day,” the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said, but he acknowledged that “we’re not there yet.”",
		"7" : "But a coalition of 10 advocacy groups — including the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the March of Dimes and the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network — urged a “no” vote.",
		"8" : "“As Congress considers this legislation, we challenge lawmakers to remember their commitment to their constituents and the American people to protect lifesaving health care for millions of Americans, including those who struggle every day with chronic and other major health conditions,” the groups said.",
		"9" : "Since Sunday, Mr. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the Republican health legislation would not allow discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Which bill Mr. Trump was referring to is not clear.",
		"10" : "Since the first version of the American Health Care Act failed to win enough House support on March 24, revisions to win over the conservative House Freedom Caucus have undermined protections for the sick. The conservatives finally endorsed the legislation last week after House leaders revised it to permit states to opt out of several mandates in the Affordable Care Act.",
		"11" : "States could, for example, allow insurers to provide a more limited package of health benefits than the Affordable Care Act requires. With a waiver, states could also allow insurers to charge higher premiums to some people with pre-existing conditions, if states had an alternative mechanism such as a high-risk pool or a reinsurance program to provide or subsidize coverage for people with serious illnesses.",
		"12" : "But such high-risk pools did not always work well before the Affordable Care Act’s outright ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions took effect.",
		"13" : "Mr. Trump appeared to be unfamiliar with details of an amendment offered by Representative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, that would allow states to obtain a waiver permitting insurers to charge higher premiums based on the “health status” of a person who had experienced a gap in coverage.",
		"14" : "That amendment won an endorsement of the bill from the House Freedom Caucus, but alienated other Republicans. Mr. Long, for instance, voted for an earlier version of the bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee in early March.",
		"15" : "Mr. Trump did not explain how the Republicans’ new health plan would produce “much lower premiums.” In its analysis of the last version of the repeal bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that average premiums in 2018 and 2019 “would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher under the legislation than under current law.” By 2026, it said, average premiums would be roughly 10 percent lower than under current law.",
		"16" : "How the revisions might affect those figures — or the estimated 24 million more Americans who would lack insurance under the original bill after 10 years — may not be known when the House votes on the new version. Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and a top Trump ally, said Republicans were not planning to seek a new cost-and-impact estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.",
		"17" : "White House officials expressed confidence on Monday that they were nearing success, at least in the House. “Do we have the votes for health care? I think we do,” Gary D. Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview with “CBS This Morning.”",
		"18" : "On the same show, Mr. Priebus predicted that the health care bill would be “one of the fastest pieces of signature legislation to go through for a president since Roosevelt.”",

		"22" : "“When I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don’t cover pre-existing conditions — we cover it beautifully,” the president said.",

		"24" : "But the amendment also says that the federal government can grant waivers allowing insurers to consider “health status” as a factor in setting rates.

		"25" : "“Health status underwriting could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions,” the American Medical Association said in a letter urging opposition.",
		"26" : "The possibility that Republicans would muster a majority for the repeal bill set off alarms among supporters of the Affordable Care Act.",
		"27" : "“We were actually more concerned when it didn’t come up for a vote last time because that meant there was no room for compromise at the middle,” said Valerie Fleisher, an organizer of 412 Resistance, a protest group outside Pittsburgh. “It would have to move more to the extreme, more to the right, to get the votes that it needed from the Freedom Caucus.”"

		"2" : "“Nancy — you’re the best,” Mr. Trump wrote to Nancy Pelosi at the beginning of 2007, scribbling on an article about her swearing-in as House speaker after Democrats seized control of the chamber. “Congrats. Donald.”",
		"3" : "Mr. Trump had a small hand in her elevation. He had made a $20,000 donation to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.",
		"4" : "A decade later, long after the two first made a gilded acquaintance at Trump Tower in Manhattan, they have emerged from the administration’s first 100 days as partisan foes with divergent policy aims but one common political goal: proving their deal-making clout in a city where each has a history of being underestimated.",
		"5" : "As Mr. Trump strains to demonstrate progress on his main campaign pledges, he has slogged through his early months with few Sherpas on Capitol Hill, pursuing halting partnerships with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan that have yielded few legislative successes.",
		"6" : "Ms. Pelosi — whose hard line on subsidy payments for insurers under the Affordable Care Act helped extract an apparent concession from the White House during recent budget negotiations — will not help Mr. Trump dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature law. She will not shepherd his tax plan, which she has called a “wish list for billionaires.”",
		"7" : "But with an ideologically shape-shifting president — and a former speaker seeking relevance in a moment when the title of House minority leader often confers little — she seems to retain at least a measure of hope that the man she met in his previous political life might re-emerge.",
		"8" : "“I could be helpful to him,” Ms. Pelosi offered without prompting during an interview last week in her office at the Capitol, saying that she knew how to address some Republicans’ concerns over the Affordable Care Act and would gladly help if they stopped pushing for a full repeal. “We’re not here to obstruct him.”",

(A newly agreed upon budget deal, announced on Sunday night, requires Democratic votes in both chambers to pass.)",

In a phone conversation the day after the election, Ms. Pelosi suggested that Mr. Trump meet with a bipartisan congressional caucus on women’s issues. Mr. Trump said his daughter Ivanka should go instead, handing her the phone. A person close to Ms. Trump said she would be happy to attend.",
		"13" : "Mr. Trump has in many ways made Ms. Pelosi’s job easier by declining to bother much with Democrats so far, binding the minority caucus in opposition. She has called Mr. Trump “one of the best organizers the Democratic Party has ever had” — a boon of sorts but also a testament, critics say, to an absence of inspiring affirmative leadership from top Democrats in Washington.",

		"19" : "But she has, at times, made herself heard.",
		"20" : "It was Ms. Pelosi who interjected, during Mr. Trump’s meeting with congressional leaders days after taking office, to correct his claim that millions of unauthorized immigrants had cost him the popular vote in November.",
		"21" : "And it was Ms. Pelosi, according to people familiar with the negotiations, who led the charge in recent days to earn assurances from the Trump administration that it would continue making subsidy payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act. The White House had threatened to withhold the payments as leverage.",
		"22" : "Ms. Pelosi played down any past relationship with Mr. Trump when he was a donor to Democrats, and her office said she had no record of Mr. Trump’s note from 2007. She recalled that former Representative Charles B. Rangel, the recently retired 23-term Harlem congressman, had helped arrange her initial meeting with Mr. Trump.",

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — Just days after the November election, top aides to Donald J. Trump huddled with congressional staff members in Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s suite of offices at the Capitol. The objective: not to get things done, but to undo them — quickly.",
		"2" : "For about three months after Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump would have the power to wipe away some of his predecessor’s most significant regulations with simple-majority votes from his allies in Congress.",
		"3" : "But the clock was ticking.",
		"4" : "An obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act gives lawmakers 60 legislative days to overturn major new regulations issued by federal agencies. After that window closes, sometime in early May, the process gets much more difficult: Executive orders by the president can take years to unwind regulations — well beyond the important 100-day yardstick for new administrations.",
		"5" : "So in weekly meetings leading up to Jan. 20, the Trump aides and lawmakers worked from a shared Excel spreadsheet to develop a list of possible targets: rules enacted late in Barack Obama’s presidency that they viewed as a vast regulatory overreach that was stifling economic growth.",
		"6" : "The result was a historic reversal of government rules in record time. Mr. Trump has used the review act as a regulatory wrecking ball, signing 13 bills that erased rules on the environment, labor, financial protections, internet privacy, abortion, education and gun rights. In the law’s 21-year history, it had been used successfully only once before, when President George W. Bush reversed a Clinton-era ergonomics rule.",
		"7" : "The effort has surpassed its architects’ most ambitious hopes. Andrew Bremberg, the president’s domestic policy chief, said he had thought Congress might be able to use the act to pass five or six bills reversing Mr. Obama’s regulations. During the transition effort, no one contemplated more than a dozen, Mr. Bremberg said.",
		"8" : "“It is a strong and very potent and powerful tool,” he said.",
		"9" : "But critics say Mr. Trump’s aggressive use of the Congressional Review Act amounts to a blunt and thoughtless assault on rules that would have increased people’s safety, secured their personal information, protected federal lands and improved education.",
		"10" : "An early Obama rule that Mr. Trump and Congress reversed would have required coal companies to make sure that waste from mountaintop mining was not polluting local waterways. Now, steps to prevent illness from contaminated drinking water will not be taken.",
		"11" : "Another rule would have required the Social Security Administration to provide information about mentally incapacitated people to law enforcement agencies that conduct background checks for gun purchases. Now, these individuals — an estimated 75,000 a year — will not need Justice Department waivers to buy guns.",
		"12" : "One eliminated regulation would have prohibited internet providers from collecting, sharing or selling consumers’ information without their permission. One would have required some businesses to keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses for five years instead of six months. And another would have prevented states from denying funding for women’s health services to facilities that also provided abortions.",
		"13" : "Republicans viewed those rules and the other eliminated regulations as unnecessary burdens enacted by a president who had resorted to executive action because he could not get his agenda through Congress. While initially skeptical of using administrative power to govern, Mr. Obama increasingly embraced the use of regulation, reshaping government more by writing new rules than by passing new legislation.",
		"14" : "“The biggest frustration in the last eight years was not knowing where the next regulation was coming from, the next rule, and that uncertainty stifled investment,” said Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s legislative affairs director, who participated in planning for the regulatory assault.",
		"15" : "Mr. Trump’s efforts to unwind Mr. Obama’s regulations go beyond the use of the Congressional Review Act. He has issued executive orders, including one instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to begin the process of rolling back far-reaching rules that would shut down many of the country’s coal-fired power plants.",
		"16" : "But reversing regulation through executive authority requires long periods of study, notice to the public and hearings. The final outcome is often challenged in court, adding to the delay.",
		"17" : "Under the Congressional Review Act, the process is cleaner and simpler. It requires only an up-or-down vote, and the outcome cannot be challenged legally.",
		"18" : "The use of that tool to attack Obama-era regulations was coordinated by a small group, including Mr. Short; Mr. Bremberg; Eric Ueland, a veteran Republican who works for the Senate Budget Committee; Rick Dearborn, the director of the transition effort and now a deputy chief of staff at the White House; and House and Senate aides. The group’s members settled on a list of rules they thought could be eradicated.",
		"19" : "“We knew we had a short window of time in order to do them,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. “That was an important part of the coordination effort.”",
		"20" : "Many Obama-era rules may survive Mr. Trump’s efforts to unwind them. Republicans have yet to repeal the Affordable Care Act, for which many of the most significant rules were written. Still, Mr. Trump’s critics say he has set a dangerous precedent with what they call his indiscriminate use of the Congressional Review Act.",
		"21" : "The critics are especially concerned about a key provision in the act that seeks to prevent all future presidents from replacing the eliminated regulations with anything similar. That part of the act has never been tested in court, but experts said it would chill efforts to draft new regulations even after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
		"22" : "“The Congressional Review Act used in this way is kind of like a nuke,” said Robert Hahn, a professor of economics at Oxford and an expert on American regulations. “We had a Democratic president who was reflecting his policy preferences toward regulation. Trump has a tool now to undo those political preferences, and he’s using it.”",
		"23" : "Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group, said in a statement that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans “have been using the C.R.A. to reward the corporate and ideological special interests that funded their campaigns. It’s an escalation of the corrupt insider-dealing that Trump campaigned against.”",
		"24" : "But what Democrats viewed as important new protections, Republicans saw as unneeded encumbrances on insurance companies, banks and other businesses.",
		"25" : "“It’s not as if there aren’t an enormous number of regulations still on the books,” Mr. Short, the president’s legislative affairs director, said. “I don’t think that we feel like there is some sort of threat by passing this legislation.”",
		"26" : "He added, “I think it would be unfair to paint it as if you are moving into an anarchical society.”"

A bigger fight awaits as the year goes on and President Trump tries to put his imprint on the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.",

Mr. Trump had wanted money in the spending deal to go toward the wall, but he backed down — a crucial concession that helped smooth the path for congressional negotiators completing the deal. (The agreement does include more funding for border security.) Mr. Trump insists he will build his wall, meaning that lawmakers are likely to face pressure to come up with funding.",

The agreement reached by lawmakers includes a permanent extension of health benefits for retired miners who faced losing coverage, a win for Mr. Manchin; Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader; and other lawmakers from coal states.",

		"2" : "The protesters called for Gov. Greg Abbott to veto the bill, which would require police chiefs and sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration officials or face jail time and fines.",
		"3" : "The protesters and their supporters filled the lobby of the State Insurance Building here, an annex of the governor’s office, singing and clapping and chanting, “Stand up, fight back!” Many wore white T-shirts reading “S.B. 4,” for Senate Bill 4, with a slash drawn through it. State troopers stood quietly nearby.",

		"7" : "The bill has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for the Texas Legislature, stirring marathon debates among lawmakers at packed overnight hearings. It passed both the House and the Senate, but in different forms, and Republican leaders in both chambers are sorting out how to proceed before sending it to the governor’s desk.",

Mr. Abbott has been critical of two Hispanic sheriffs in particular: Lupe Valdez of Dallas County and Sally Hernandez of Travis County, which includes Austin. Earlier this year, Mr. Abbott canceled state criminal-justice grants to Travis County over the issue.",

The police chiefs in six cities — Arlington, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio — were among those who signed a letter opposing the House version of the bill.",

		"1" : "As a mom who lost her son to suicide in 2013, a Houston nurse became concerned when she heard about the popular Netflix show “13 Reasons Why.” By then her 15-year-old daughter had already binge-watched it.",
		"2" : "In the series, the character Hannah Baker kills herself in despair, leaving audiotapes for the people she holds responsible, among them, her rapist, fickle friends and bullies. The tapes are part justification for her suicide and part vengeful accusation of her peers.",
		"3" : "But in the month since the show’s release, a rising chorus of mental health experts contend that too many of the show’s messages on suicide are inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Superintendents and school counselors around the country have issued warnings to parents that “13 Reasons Why” glorifies suicide and could lead to an increase in copycat behavior and self-harm among vulnerable students. “We are concerned about our children watching this series without adult supervision because it romanticizes and sensationalizes the idea of suicide,” Lisa Brady, superintendent of schools in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., wrote in an email to parents.",
		"4" : "Its creators have defended the show, saying they aimed to make the drama helpful to struggling kids.",
		"5" : "But for the nurse’s family, the show has been devastating. Her daughter, who found her brother’s body, has been working through depression and trauma ever since. With treatment and regular therapy, things got better — until she watched “13 Reasons Why.” Now the show has set off new thoughts of despair and suicide in her daughter, she said.",
		"6" : "“If I’d known about the show beforehand I would have monitored her Netflix account a bit more,” said the nurse, whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter’s privacy. “If kids have a history of depression, self-harm or suicidal thoughts, I don’t think they need to watch it.”",
		"7" : "On Friday, in a letter to parents, Robert Avossa, superintendent of Palm Beach County schools in Florida, reported that his employees have seen an uptick in self-mutilation and threats of suicide among elementary and middle school students since the show began.",
		"8" : "The Netflix series, which may be renewed for a second season, is based on the 2007 young adult novel “Thirteen Reasons Why,” by Jay Asher. It includes a graphic scene in which Hannah kills herself with a razor. Its creators say it’s an unglamorous death, and they worked hard to make sure it wasn’t gratuitous.",
		"9" : "Netflix has created an accompanying 30-minute documentary “Beyond the Reasons,” that includes the cast, producers and mental health experts discussing some of the show’s more difficult scenes. In the documentary Brian Yorkey, the creator of the series, said, “We did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted it to be very clear that there is nothing — in any way — worthwhile about suicide.”",
		"10" : "In a statement, Netflix said the writers sought the advice of medical professionals while writing the script, and the show carries a TV-MA rating as well as a warning about graphic content. “Our members tell us that 13 Reasons Why has helped spark important conversations in their families and communities around the world,” the statement said.",
		"11" : "Some parents have defended the show. Dawn Zawadzki, a paralegal from Fort Mill, S.C., said she watched part of the series with her 16-year-old daughter. “Everybody is saying ‘it glamorizes suicide,’ but I don’t think it does,” she said. “It’s making us wake up and look at it.”",
		"12" : "Not everyone agrees. Just before its March 31 release, a producer sought the support of the JED Foundation, a teen suicide prevention group. “I think they were looking for us to say, ‘It was a great educational tool,’” or that “they handled the issues in a psychologically helpful way,” said Dr. Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at the JED Foundation.",
		"13" : "Ultimately, he could not support what he called “one long revenge story.” The group issued a guide about the show, advising people who choose to watch it to view it with someone else and to take breaks between episodes rather than binge watch.",
		"14" : "“It’s complicated, because they got a lot of important issues out on the table,” Dr. Schwartz said. But he’s concerned that students could think of suicide as a way to get back at people and worried that showing the specific way Hannah died would spur imitators. “The missteps are high stakes,” he concluded.",
		"15" : "The problem, suicide prevention experts said, is that even an ugly suicide can beget copycats. Research has shown that “someone else’s death by suicide can reinforce a vulnerable person’s motivation to die by suicide,” said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia University.",
		"16" : "On Instagram, Paris Jackson, a 19-year-old model who has tried to kill herself in the past, called the series, “extremely triggering.” “Please only watch this show with caution and keep in mind that it may put you in a dark place,” she wrote in a post that got more than 20,000 likes.",
		"17" : "The National Association of School Psychologists has advised teenagers, who have had suicidal thoughts, to avoid the series entirely. They recommend that any teenager should watch with a parent who can make it clear that suicide is not a solution to problems.",
		"18" : "The show’s fatalism leaves the impression that suicide can’t be stopped, experts said. In one concerning scene, a character agonizes that he could have done more to help his friend. A school counselor tells him: “If she wanted to end her life, we weren’t going to stop her.”",
		"19" : "The statement runs counter to the advice given to teachers and peers about how to help at-risk teens.",
		"20" : "“For kids, that action is staying with your friend, not keeping it a secret, and telling a trusted adult,” said Richard Lieberman, who coordinated suicide prevention for Los Angeles Unified School District for 25 years. Another option is to call the National Suicide Prevention line, 1-800-273-8255, or text HOME to 741741.",
		"21" : "David N. Miller, the author of “Child and Adolescent Suicidal Behavior: School-Based Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention,” said that children and adolescents often tell their peers about their suicidal behavior rather than adults. He said, \"the way adults are portrayed as incompetent or clueless” is a major problem in “13 Reasons Why,” because he thought it would dissuade students from seeking critical assistance.",
		"22" : "Hours before her death, Hannah goes to see the school counselor, hints that a senior assaulted her, and cryptically says, her eyes welling with tears, that “I need everything to stop, people, life.” He hands her tissues, but doesn’t conduct a suicide-risk assessment or consider hospitalization.",
		"23" : "“That was gross negligence,” Dr. Miller said, and it sends “a dangerous message” that adults don’t care.",
		"24" : "Although the creators of “13 Reasons Why” aspired to educate, the show itself never mentions a critical point: most children who die by suicide have a mental health disorder like depression that’s treatable.",
		"25" : "And throughout the series, as other characters talk of suicide, little is done to address their struggles. “The series is actually depicting suicide contagion, and at the same time, it’s denying the suicide contagion exists,” Dr. Gould said. It’s “so upsetting to me on so many levels.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "What if you or your child had a chronic illness that seriously limited or threatened life, and modern medicine had no effective or acceptable treatments to offer you?",
		"2" : "Imagine you were plagued by severe food allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or intractable epilepsy. Would you be willing or desperate or brave enough to step outside the realm of established medicine and seek help from an unconventional therapist — even someone with no medical or scientific training?",
		"3" : "What if you heard about others in a similar situation who had tried a purported remedy that appeared to work, or the method seemed to make biological sense?",
		"4" : "In her new book, “The Other Side of Impossible,” Susannah Meadows, a Brooklyn-based former senior writer for Newsweek, has compiled compelling stories about people who faced and ultimately surmounted daunting medical challenges. The book focuses on several families, including her own, who felt they had no choice but to wade into the world of unproven therapies.",
		"5" : "The families’ ventures into a realm that some would call quackery were typically inspired by love, desperation and hope, and were fueled by irrepressible grit and determination to find solutions to debilitating health problems that defied the best that conventional medicine could offer.",
		"6" : "Their stories left me in awe of their persistence against formidable odds. As one mother replied when asked how she persevered through a five-year search for a way to control her daughter’s relentless seizures: “You can’t not try. She’s not better yet.”",
		"7" : "In her analysis of the disparate yet related cases, Ms. Meadows highlights at least three important influences on well-being that have yet to receive their just due in understanding what might cause or aggravate certain intractable medical disorders.",
		"8" : "One is a characteristic called “leaky gut,” essentially tiny holes in the intestinal walls that allow proteins to reach the bloodstream where they can trigger a vicious immune attack on healthy tissues.",
		"9" : "Another is an imbalance of microbes in the gut and how communication between the brain and the gut can adversely affect behavior and emotional stability. A third is the still underappreciated interaction of mind and body, especially the effect that anxiety and fear can have on the body’s response to otherwise harmless substances.",
		"10" : "There is perhaps a fourth factor, Ms. Meadows said in an interview, that seems to foster perseverance in seeking recovery from an incurable condition: “Early life experiences in coping with adversity that may inoculate people against hopelessness and prompt them to believe that if they would just keep trying they would succeed.”",
		"11" : "Or as the son of one patient profiled in the book put it: “Courage is knowing you’re licked and doing it anyway.”",
		"12" : "That patient was Dr. Terry Wahls, who overcame a progressive form of multiple sclerosis for which medicine had little to offer.",
		"13" : "Once confined to a reclining wheelchair despite trying a range of conventional treatments, Dr. Wahls researched, then adopted, a diet that eliminated grains, dairy and sugar but included 12 cups a day of berries and vegetables supplemented with grass-fed beef, organ meats and oily fish. She combined this with neuromuscular electrical stimulation and exercise.",
		"14" : "Within a year, Dr. Wahls had ditched her motorized assists and started riding a bicycle. Eight years later, she shows no signs of her disease. Last summer, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which has been tracking research into diet and inflammation, committed more than $1 million to study the effect of her diet on M.S.-related fatigue.",
		"15" : "Ms. Meadows summarized the overriding lesson derived from the people in her book: “You have a choice to keep going when others say you can’t. They had no reason to think they could succeed, but they just wouldn’t give up.”",
		"16" : "Ms. Meadows said this was not something she understood when her son Shepherd was given a diagnosis at age 3 of polyarticular juvenile arthritis, a crippling condition affecting multiple joints.",
		"17" : "She and her husband were told he was unlikely to outgrow it. Facing a choice of doing nothing or treating him with a potent drug that “made him feel bad and did little for his arthritis,” she learned about a child with the same condition who was helped by avoiding gluten and dairy products and taking fish oil, probiotics and a Chinese herb.",
		"18" : "“With nothing to lose — if it helped one child, maybe it will help ours,” Ms. Meadows said. “In terms of hope, an example of one is very important.” And as she reported four years ago in an article in The New York Times Magazine, Shepherd got better.",
		"19" : "Eventually, with the help of a self-styled healer named Amy Thieringer, who emphasizes the need to calm fear and anxiety when trying to counter food sensitivities, Shepherd was gradually reintroduced to gluten and dairy and “now eats everything without any problems, no more painful, inflamed joints,” his mother said.",
		"20" : "Although Amanda Hanson was warned by her son Hayden’s allergy specialist that attempting Ms. Thieringer’s treatment for the boy, who had life-threatening allergies to 28 different foods, would be playing Russian roulette with his life, she felt she had no choice but to try.",
		"21" : "Inspired by the testimony of other mothers facing a similar problem, and knowing that doctors had no solution for Hayden’s allergies, Ms. Hanson bought into the Thieringer program known as allergy release technique.",
		"22" : "Borrowing ideas from cognitive behavioral therapy, Ms. Thieringer first worked to ratchet down Hayden’s fear of certain foods before introducing them in tiny increments until he could consume them in normal amounts without a reaction.",
		"23" : "Now 16, Hayden has had no bad reaction to any food since completing the program six years ago.",
		"24" : "As a careful journalist, Ms. Meadows make no claims for cures. Her book is not prescriptive, though it describes the science that might explain the unlikely recoveries she has written about.",
		"25" : "“I’m a journalist reporting on the fact that there is a whole community of people who are looking for, and in some cases finding, answers to health problems on their own.”",
		"26" : "There is another important message in this book worth mentioning, and that is the enormous obstacles to producing ironclad evidence for the kinds of approaches that brought relief to the people Ms. Meadows interviewed.",
		"27" : "The treatments often involved a combination of interventions and few, if any, profit-making products. Thus, no company is likely to pay for the needed studies, which would also probably be too costly and complicated for government agencies to underwrite."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "BEIJING — Wu Xiaohui, the Chinese tycoon who was in failed talks with President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to buy into a skyscraper project in Manhattan, is fighting allegations of financial chicanery and has threatened to sue a Chinese magazine that examined his company’s labyrinthine funding.",
		"2" : "The Anbang Insurance Group, which Mr. Wu controls as president and chief executive, said on Sunday that it would take legal action against Caixin Media and its editor in chief, Hu Shuli, after Caixin Weekly magazine questioned whether Anbang was as financially robust as the company claimed.",
		"3" : "“Anbang’s shareholder structure is like a maze,” Caixin said in an article published online on Saturday and in print on Monday. It said that Anbang’s meteoric growth and acquisitions raised suspicions of financial sleight of hand, including capital injections coming from companies linked to Mr. Wu.",
		"4" : "“The left hand has been helping the right hand to inflate capital,” the article said.",
		"5" : "Anbang hit back with its own incendiary accusations. Caixin is a widely respected economics weekly, and its findings echoed an extensive report on Anbang by The New York Times last year. But Anbang suggested on Sunday that Caixin had published its report after failing to squeeze advertising orders and other contributions from Anbang.",
		"6" : "According to Anbang, Caixin falsely claimed that Mr. Wu had married three times and “made a series of smears and slanders against our company’s legitimate business activities.” The marriage allegation appeared to refer to a report in Caixin in 2015.",
		"7" : "Caixin responded to Anbang’s threat to sue with its own threat of litigation. On its website on Monday, Caixin said the suggestion that it took on Anbang out of vengefulness was “an attempt at framing with no basis in facts.”",
		"8" : "“We strongly condemn the slander in the Anbang statement and reserve the right to take legal recourse,” Caixin said. A director of communications at Caixin, Ma Ling, declined to answer questions and referred to the online statement.",
		"9" : "Caixin’s latest report on Anbang has been part of a burst of unwelcome attention for the company and Mr. Wu, which has thrown into doubt his business acumen and his reputation for political invulnerability.",
		"10" : "“The level of detail that is provided in the article is, I think, relatively unique for any type of story of a Chinese company in Chinese media,” Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the Peking University HSBC Business School in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said by telephone.",
		"11" : "A lawsuit would pit a company that has recently appeared politically vulnerable against a magazine that has proved skilled at navigating censorship to report on corruption and financial shenanigans in China.",
		"12" : "The controversy over Anbang has come while the Chinese Communist Party government under President Xi Jinping is seeking stability ahead of a leadership turnover later this year. But Mr. Xi also vowed in late April to rid China’s banks, insurers and other financial companies of excessive risk. Last month, Xiang Junbo, the chief regulator of Chinese insurers, including Anbang, was put under investigation by party anticorruption investigators.",
		"13" : "The questions raised by the article, and by the possibility of a lawsuit, may test whether the desire for stability will outweigh the government’s vows to take on nettlesome financial issues.",
		"14" : "“Anbang is definitely a little bit more extreme and more aggressive than other Chinese insurance companies,” Mr. Balding said. “But at the same time, if you look at the finances of the insurance industry at large, and at individual insurance companies, their revenue and building and things like that were exploding by just astounding rates in the past few years.”",
		"15" : "Guo Wengui, a Chinese businessman who fled abroad, has added to the recent jitters in Beijing by publicizing allegations — many of them lurid and difficult to corroborate — of corruption reaching into the party elite. Mr. Guo has also clashed with Caixin.",
		"16" : "Mr. Wu’s family and personal ties are at the heart of the growing questions about Anbang, which he co-founded in 2004.",
		"17" : "He has been a member by marriage of China’s political and business aristocracy: He married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the Communist patriarch who oversaw China’s market reforms in the 1980s. Mr. Wu also came close to sealing a partnership with American political royalty through Mr. Kushner, the New York developer who is a son-in-law and adviser of Mr. Trump.",
		"18" : "Anbang was in talks with Mr. Kushner’s family company to pay $400 million for a stake in a flagship skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Anbang bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel, a popular venue on the New York social calendar, in 2014 as part of a spree of acquisitions.",
		"19" : "But the deal with Mr. Kushner’s company foundered in March, in the wake of growing controversy about a presidential in-law doing business with a Chinese conglomerate with many ties to Beijing’s political elite. Mr. Kushner has also become an influential White House adviser to Mr. Trump, including on China policy.",
		"20" : "Anbang’s international luster had already dulled after it withdrew an application last year to buy an Iowa insurer, Fidelity & Guaranty Life, and also  shelved a $14 billion bid to buy Starwood Hotels and Resorts. Before those deals foundered, American investors and regulators raised doubts about Anbang’s opaque ownership and its financial strength.",
		"21" : "Now Caixin has laid out similar doubts for its readers. The Chinese news media had already raised questions about Anbang’s spending spree, but Caixin stepped into more sensitive territory by examining the group’s ownership and accounts in painstaking detail.",
		"22" : "In 18 months from October 2014, Caixin estimated, Anbang had spent $16 billion on overseas acquisitions. But Caixin also said Anbang’s successive injections of capital, which have helped finance these deals, appeared to often involve companies linked to Mr. Wu’s relatives and associates, raising the possibility that they were not real injections by outside investors.",
		"23" : "Anbang appeared to have “used circular injections of funding to magnify its capital,” the report said.",
		"24" : "The Caixin report said those doubts were reinforced by Anbang’s complicated ownership. Many of those companies registered under obscure addresses, with little capital registered in their names, and often they were formed in clusters shortly before they bought into Anbang — findings that echo the Times report. The names, addresses and other details of dozens of people registered as holding shares suggested that they were Mr. Wu’s relatives and associates.",
		"25" : "Until recent days, Anbang was mostly silent about the reports on Mr. Wu and the group’s finances, including internet-born rumors that he had been held as part of a criminal investigation. No Chinese officials have said anything to suggest that Mr. Wu was detained or under investigation.",
		"26" : "But since late last week the company has fought back. Anbang issued a statement on Friday that it had sufficient cash flows; it told a Chinese newspaper that rumors that Mr. Wu was in detention were false; and Mr. Wu gave an interview to another Chinese newspaper, The Beijing News, that also seemed intended to squash the rumors.",
		"27" : "Mr. Wu said in the interview that Anbang was especially enthusiastic about Mr. Xi’s plan to expand Chinese investment and construction abroad in a much-promoted plan called “One Belt, One Road.” Now investors and political analysts will watch to see whether Mr. Xi’s government takes sides in the dispute between Anbang and Caixin.",
		"28" : "“Hu Shuli and Caixin have done an amazing job carving out a space for honest and incisive reporting in China’s heavily censored media,” Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies finance and politics in China, said by email. “Caixin will need all of its savvy to navigate the Anbang lawsuit though.”"

		"3" : "The 2006 painting has become the symbol of a global initiative by the Indonesian youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest mass Islamic organization in the world, that seeks to reinterpret Islamic law dating from the Middle Ages in ways that conform to 21st-century norms.",
		"4" : "Among other things, it calls for a re-examination of elements of Islamic law that dictate relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, the structure of government and the proper aims and conduct of warfare.",
		"5" : "Leaders of Nahdlatul Ulama’s youth wing, known as Ansor, say that elements of Shariah, which Muslims consider divine law, are being manipulated by groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda to justify terrorist attacks around the world, invoked to rally fighters to battle in the Middle East and elsewhere, and distorted by movements that seek to turn Islam into a political weapon.",
		"6" : "“The classical Islamic perspective is dominated by views that position non-Muslims as enemies or, at best, as suspicious figures not worthy of trust,” H. Yaqut Qoumas, Ansor’s chairman, said in an interview.",
		"7" : "“Fiqh,” or the body of jurisprudence that applies Shariah to everyday life, “explicitly rejects the possibility of non-Muslims enjoying equal rights with Muslims in the public sphere, including the right to occupy certain positions,” he said. “This classical Islamic perspective continues to possess an extraordinarily powerful authority in the eyes of most Muslims, and is regarded as standard, orthodox Islam.”",
		"8" : "Some interpretations of classical Islamic law teach that Muslims have a duty to seek out and fight Christians, Jews and followers of Zoroastrianism until they either convert to Islam or submit to its rule and pay a head tax.",
		"9" : "These interpretations have been enthusiastically adopted by the Islamic State.",
		"10" : "Also, some interpretations of classical Islamic law, and of certain passages in the Quran, forbid Muslims from having non-Muslim political leaders. Medieval Islamic jurisprudence, still regarded as valid by some, is used to justify slavery and the execution of prisoners.",

		"12" : "The Indonesian initiative, however, aims to directly approach governments around the world, both Muslim-majority and otherwise, as well as at the United Nations, to achieve a global consensus on reforming what it views as archaic interpretations of Islam.",
		"13" : "“The challenge we face is not confined to religious views that emerged through an intellectual process conducted a thousand years ago. We are also confronted by religious and political authorities whose institutions are deeply intertwined with these views, and thus continue to inculcate such teachings among each new generation of Muslims,” Mr. Yaqut said.",
		"14" : "Nonetheless, some Islamic scholars and experts note that because there are so many diverging interpretations of Islamic law and the Quran, it would be difficult to reach an international consensus on reforms.",
		"15" : "“There’s a whole library of interpretations of jihad — Muslims must fight non-Muslim states to expand territory, for example,” said Ruud Peters, an emeritus professor of Islamic law at the University of Amsterdam. “But since the 19th century, there have been interpretations followed by many Muslim states to only defend against attack from non-Muslim states.”",
		"16" : "Another problem, scholars and experts said, is the cultural differences among predominantly Muslim countries in interpreting Islamic law. Indonesia, in Southeast Asia, for example, practices one of the most liberal forms of Islam in the world, while simultaneously having a secular government and Constitution, with full rights for Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and other religious minorities.",
		"17" : "Saudi Arabia, in the Middle East, however, practices the conservative Wahhabi Islam, and its government does not officially recognize any of its citizens as being Christian.",

		"19" : "He added that while Indonesian Islamic leaders had good intentions, substantive changes would be successful only if support for them emerged within the Arab world.",
		"20" : "The Ansor initiative is seen as another move by young Muslims in Indonesia, as well as Islamic clerics and other Muslim organizations in Europe and the Middle East, to push back against extreme, conservative interpretations of Islam.",
		"21" : "“The general impression we sometimes get in the West about Islam is one of radicalization,” said Raphaël Lefèvre, a nonresident political Islam scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Center, “while an equally if not more important trend is the ongoing struggle by Muslim clerics to redefine what Islamic law has to say about society and politics in ways deemed more compatible with modern life.”"

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump continued his outreach to rogue leaders on Monday, declaring he would meet North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, provided the circumstances were right, even as the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, brushed aside the president’s invitation to visit the White House, saying he might be “too busy.”",
		"2" : "Mr. Trump’s unorthodox overtures — to a nuclear-armed despot who brutally purged his rivals, and an insurgent politician accused of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects — illustrated the president’s confidence in his ability to make deals and his willingness to talk to virtually anyone.",
		"3" : "Above all, they highlighted his penchant for flouting the norms of diplomacy, no matter his larger aim.",
		"4" : "No sitting American president has met with a North Korean leader since Mr. Kim’s grandfather Kim Il-sung established a Stalinist state there after the Korean War. However vague and impromptu, Mr. Trump’s offer shook up an unsettled situation on the Korean Peninsula, which has been alarmed by the prospect of a military clash between the United States and the North.",
		"5" : "“Kim Jong-un would be delighted to meet with President Trump on the basis of one nuclear leader to another,” said Christopher R. Hill, a career diplomat who was special envoy on North Korea under President George W. Bush. “If I were Trump I would pass on that.”",
		"6" : "Mr. Duterte’s backhanded response to Mr. Trump, however, also showed the pitfalls of his personal brand of diplomacy. The president had already gotten fierce criticism from human rights groups for embracing a man viewed by many as being responsible for the deaths of thousands of people involved in the drug trade. Now he faces being snubbed by Mr. Duterte as well.",
		"7" : "And he is working to keep open lines of communication with President Vladimir V. Putin, despite partially blaming the Russian leader last month for the continuing civil war in Syria. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are scheduled to speak by telephone on Tuesday afternoon, the White House announced late Monday.",
		"8" : "“The most serious risk with this series of uncoordinated and controversial statements is that they undermine the most important currency of U.S. power: the credibility of the president’s words,” said Evan S. Medeiros, who served as a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.",
		"9" : "Mr. Trump first broached the idea of sitting down with Mr. Kim during the 2016 presidential campaign. He revived it in an interview Monday with Bloomberg News, saying, “If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely; I would be honored to do it.”",
		"10" : "The White House clarified that Mr. Trump would only consider a meeting if the North Korean leader met a series of conditions, starting with a sharp curtailment of his provocative behavior. North Korea carried out its most recent ballistic missile test, which failed, only last week.",
		"11" : "“We want to hold out the possibility that if North Korea were ever serious about completely dismantling its nuclear capability and taking away the threat that they pose both to the region and to us,” the press secretary, Sean Spicer, said, “there is always going to be a possibility of that occurring.” But he added, “That possibility is not there at this time.”",
		"12" : "For now, the Trump administration is pursuing a more traditional strategy of tightening economic pressure on the North — mainly through its neighbor, China — and backing that up with threat of military action. Mr. Trump said last week that while he wanted to solve the crisis with North Korea through diplomacy, a “major, major conflict” was possible.",
		"13" : "Some experts said Mr. Trump’s openness to diplomacy reflected the influence of China, which has long urged the United States to speak directly to North Korea. Since Mr. Trump met last month in Florida with President Xi Jinping of China, he has praised Mr. Xi for what he insisted was China’s willingness to use its leverage over the North to curb its behavior.",
		"14" : "“The Chinese have told Trump, ‘You’ve got to talk to these people,’” said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at Johns Hopkins University, who was involved in diplomacy during the Clinton administration that led to a nuclear agreement with North Korea in 1994.",
		"15" : "“They’re trying to create the right circumstances for talks,” Mr. Wit said, “ramping up the pressure on the Chinese, ramping up the pressure on the North Koreans, and then opening up an escape route.”",
		"16" : "But the timing of Mr. Trump’s overture, analysts and diplomats said, was hopelessly premature. In these types of negotiations, American presidents typically function as closers — taking over the process, after all the spadework has been done, to bridge the last gaps. So far, Mr. Kim has displayed no interest in even beginning such a negotiation.",
		"17" : "Mr. Trump has spoken generously of Mr. Kim in recent days, noting that he survived the treacherous political circles in Pyongyang after he first assumed power as a young man. Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Kim repelled an effort by an uncle to take power back from him. In 2013, Mr. Kim purged his powerful uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was later executed.",
		"18" : "Human rights groups also suspect Mr. Kim was behind the assassination of his exiled half brother, Kim Jong-nam, who was accosted in an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by two assailants wielding a liquid containing the nerve agent VX.",
		"19" : "Beyond the palace intrigue, the Kim family has presided over one of the world’s most repressive regimes, leaving the country in tatters and its people in misery.",
		"20" : "Asked to explain why Mr. Trump would consider it an honor to meet such a leader, Mr. Spicer said, “I guess because he’s still a head of state.” He noted that there were “a lot of potential threats that could have come his way, and he’s obviously managed to lead a country forward.” Mr. Spicer added, “He is a young person to be leading a country with nuclear weapons.”",
		"21" : "For his part, Mr. Duterte appeared unimpressed by Mr. Trump’s invitation to the White House, which the president made during a phone call on Saturday, to the surprise of his own staff. The Philippine leader said he and Mr. Trump had an amicable conversation, but he was noncommittal about visiting Washington, saying he had a busy schedule.",
		"22" : "“I cannot make any definite promise,” Mr. Duterte said to reporters after touring Chinese warships in Davao City, his hometown. “I’m supposed to go to Russia, I’m also supposed to go to Israel.”",
		"23" : "If Mr. Duterte rejected Mr. Trump’s invitation, he would spare him further criticism for playing host to a leader with a toxic reputation. On Sunday, senior officials said they expected the State Department and the National Security Council to resist a White House visit. But on Monday, an official said the White House did not pass word to Mr. Duterte to demur.",
		"24" : "Mr. Spicer defended the invitation, saying the Philippines were important to isolating North Korea diplomatically and economically. Mr. Trump, he said, had been briefed about Mr. Duterte’s record before he made the call.",
		"25" : "Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, said he expected Mr. Duterte would still come to the United States, but might not want to seem too eager to do so. The Philippine leader has made a show of his independence from the United States, a treaty ally.",
		"26" : "“Even though he welcomes a better relationship with this U.S. president, he wants to be cautious that he does not appear to be embracing the U.S. too much,” Mr. Kurlantzick said, “given that he has devoted a fair amount of diplomatic resources to courting China.”"

		"1" : "DARWIN, Australia — South Korea, Japan and the United States have grown accustomed to North Korea’s diatribes, but Pyongyang recently threatened a new target with a nuclear strike: Australia.",
		"2" : "During a visit by Vice President Mike Pence to Sydney, the North warned Australia to think twice about “blindly and zealously toeing the U.S. line” and acting as “a shock brigade of the U.S. master.”",
		"3" : "Australian and American troops have fought side by side in every major conflict since World War I, and there are few militaries in the world with closer relations: 1,250 United States Marines recently arrived in Darwin for six months of joint exercises; the two countries share intelligence from land, sea and even outer space; and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is slated to meet President Trump on Thursday on an aircraft carrier in New York.",
		"4" : "But North Korea’s threat against the country, far-fetched as it might seem, is an example of how Australia’s most important military alliance faces a new challenge: the risk that President Trump will draw the nation into a conflict or other unexpected crisis that destabilizes the region, angers its trading partners or forces it to side with either the United States or China.",
		"5" : "“The question is: What might America drag Australia into?” said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney. “That’s a very scary thought for Australians, many of whom perceive Donald Trump to be an erratic and highly self-interested commander in chief.”",
		"6" : "Mr. Trump has already embarrassed Australia once, with an abrupt phone call to Mr. Turnbull that seemed to dismiss Australia’s historic role as a friend who often gives more than it gets. Now his unpredictable approach is fueling a national debate about Australia’s relationship with the world, and especially the United States. Last week, Paul Keating, a prime minister during the Clinton years, reignited discussion by arguing that Australia must end its status as a “client state.”",
		"7" : "Australia is essentially caught between two powers: China, its largest trading partner, and the United States, its faithful ally, with a military connection that has been strengthened by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and more recent agreements to gradually expand the American footprint in Darwin.",
		"8" : "What Australia and the United States are now trying to work out is how to manage that military momentum in an increasingly tense part of the world. If the military is a hammer in the Trump era, at what point does every dispute start to look like a nail?",
		"9" : "“It’s always important that there’s a balance between the military and the diplomatic — because of the scale of the military,” Mr. Keating said in an interview. “In both economic terms and in strategic terms, they squeeze diplomacy out.”",
		"10" : "Darwin, a humid, crocodile-infested coastal city at the northern end of this vast country, captures the past, present and future of Australia’s alliance with the United States.",
		"11" : "Japan attacked the city on Feb. 19, 1942, killing 235 people, and residents are quick to point out that the raids were led by the same commander responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor 10 weeks earlier.",
		"12" : "Within a few months, Darwin became a hub for counterstrikes from bombers flown by Americans. A pocket guide for arriving American troops set the tone: “You’re going to meet a people who like Americans and whom you will like.”",
		"13" : "During the Cold War, the relationship expanded.",
		"14" : "Kim Beazley, a former defense minister and ambassador to the United States, cited the rise during the 1960s of three joint installations to maintain contact with American submarines in the Indian Ocean and provide infrared detection of Soviet capabilities, increasing the warning time for a potential Soviet strike to 30 minutes from 15.",
		"15" : "Those installations and the ones that followed — especially Pine Gap, a joint Australian-American spy base that helps provide battlefield intelligence and early warnings for missile launches around the world — “are never talked about, but they’re really the guts of the alliance,” Mr. Beazley said.",
		"16" : "On the ground in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, Australian troops are also peers in battle, said Lt. Col. Brian S. Middleton, commanding officer of the Third Battalion, Fourth Marines — the American unit that just moved into Darwin for six months of training with the Australians.",
		"17" : "As part of the American pivot to Asia, the long-term plan, negotiated under the Obama administration, is to send up to 2,500 Marines to Darwin — the largest deployment of United States forces to Australia since World War II. “It’ll make us more effective in whatever conflict we end up serving in together,” said Kelly Magsamen, the Pentagon’s top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration.",
		"18" : "Other American officials said that in space, missile defense and cyberwarfare, the Australians are all in. Australia is working with the United States to relocate a special radar that helps better track satellites. The Australian military is also making a big push in innovation in undersea warfare and drones in the air and underwater.",
		"19" : "And in many cases, that means purchases of American equipment. An Australian defense planning report last year laid out a $20 billion increase in the annual military budget by 2025, including money for fighter jets, surveillance technology, submarines, surface ships and other equipment.",
		"20" : "Australians are embedded at every level of the American military. Australian Air Commodore Phillip Champion’s story is common: He first worked with the Americans as a young pilot in the early ’80s, flying surveillance aircraft, and later as a commander all over the world, including Afghanistan.",
		"21" : "“We’ve grown up together,” he said in an interview by phone from Hawaii, where he has been posted to the United States Pacific Command since January. “We trust each other and know we can operate together.”",
		"22" : "Still, there have been challenges. In a discussion last year about the cost of the Marines in Darwin, the Australians came in with a data-heavy presentation asserting that United States Marines eat more than typical Australian soldiers, and therefore strain sewage systems more, and argued that the Americans should pay more of the costs of improving wastewater lines on military bases. The proposal stunned even the lead Australian negotiators, who quickly dropped it, according to American defense officials.",
		"23" : "The toughest issues have involved China, the crucial lever of influence with North Korea and the region. Some American officials have urged Australia to engage in robust freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, where China has set up bases on disputed islands, but the Australians have resisted.",
		"24" : "Last year, American officials also expressed alarm about a port in Darwin that local officials leased to a Chinese company for $361 million, possibly making it easier to collect intelligence on American and Australian forces stationed nearby.",
		"25" : "“China is the elephant in the room for both of us,” Ms. Magsamen said. “We need to have a more frank and structured discussion amongst ourselves about how to manage that relationship.”",
		"26" : "Allan Gyngell, who ran Australia’s intelligence agency from 2009 to 2013, argues in a new book, “Fear of Abandonment,” that Australia’s foreign policy is still driven by worries about being left isolated, without the promise of security from a powerful friend: first Britain, now the United States.",
		"27" : "Mr. Keating, the former prime minister, is among those urging a more independent foreign policy in which Australia accepts China as the region’s dominant power.",
		"28" : "In the discussion last week at the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney, Mr. Keating said Australia should say no to the United States more often — as France and Canada do — especially on issues that affect Australia’s relationship with China.",
		"29" : "Those who reject this argument include John Howard, the prime minister who followed Mr. Keating and was in Washington on Sept. 11, 2001. In an interview at his modest office, with worn carpets and military memorabilia, Mr. Howard warned against being “mesmerized by China” and said his Liberal Party, which is the more conservative of the country’s two largest parties, had “pulled off the daily double.”",
		"30" : "“We deepened our relationship with the U.S. — and China became our biggest customer,” he said.",
		"31" : "He added that too many Australians were jumping to conclusions about President Trump. “He’s different,” Mr. Howard said. “Whether he’s good different or bad different is not the point; the world has to get used to him.”",
		"32" : "In Darwin too, there are divisions. Luke Bowen, who heads an economic development agency for the Northern Territory, which includes Darwin, would like to see even more American troops and equipment move in to the area, possibly from the Philippines.",
		"33" : "“It’s a priority for us to make the fit as comfortable as possible,” he said. “It’s not just about the Australian presence. It’s about the combined presence.”",
		"34" : "But Justin Tutty, who works with a watchdog group that monitors the impact of the American Marines, said he was worried about “a one-sided relationship” in which the Americans lay out the priorities.",
		"35" : "“The overinvestment in ‘interoperability’ ties us closer to our larger foreign partner’s attack formation, and reduces our capacity to act, relate and think independently,” he said.",
		"36" : "Last week for Anzac Day, commemorating Australians and New Zealanders who died in battle, American Marines and Australian soldiers marched through Darwin’s streets together. Later, there were friendly games of rugby, and infantrymen shared war stories.",
		"37" : "“The Australians have been fighting in the same places we’ve fought for over 100 years,” said Colonel Middleton of the Marines. “When we operate with the Australians, we learn as much from them as they learn from us.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "When asked about this year’s presidential election, French historians often draw a comparison that could initially seem outlandish.",
		"2" : "The war that France fought in Algeria, they said, cleaved French society, opening crises of identity and integration that still drive politics, much as the Civil War lurks within the racial and regional politics still roiling the United States.",
		"3" : "“The Algerian war was a French civil war,” Benjamin Stora, the conflict’s foremost historian, said in a recent interview from his home in Paris.",
		"4" : "In Algeria, independence groups fought to end 130 years of French rule. Within France, Mr. Stora said, the war was an ideological conflict over “two conceptions of the nation,” one that saw France as an empire and Algeria as core to its greatness, and another that rejected colonialism. The war also became a struggle over whether French identity could expand to include the mostly Muslim Algerians.",
		"5" : "When France withdrew in defeat in 1962, the guns quieted, but those tensions over identity only intensified in France.",
		"6" : "Settlers, along with their supporters in France, experienced Algeria’s loss so profoundly that many still speak of reclaiming France’s lost glory — often while explaining their support for Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate.",
		"7" : "Questions over French identity, opened by the war, still pit the French against one another.",
		"8" : "The politics of nostalgia and grievance so closely parallel the American South, Mr. Stora said, that he has termed them “Sudisme à la Française.”",
		"9" : "The parallel has its limits, but it highlights how disputes over the Algerian war’s legacy, while often too painful to confront directly, are reverberating in the French presidential election, which will end in a runoff on Sunday.",
		"10" : "Nearly one million settlers, known as pieds-noirs, fled Algeria after the war. Many arrived in southern towns where Ms. Le Pen’s far-right National Front today draws heavy support, and that are dotted with gravestone-like monuments to the lost territory. Schools across France were briefly required by law to teach the benefits of French colonialism, though the law was repealed in 2006, less than a year after it was enacted.",
		"11" : "In conversation with voters in the area, questions about seemingly disparate topics of present-day politics — immigration, French republican values, the struggle against anti-Semitism, the rising support for the National Front — all come back to Algeria, as Mr. Stora suggested.",
		"12" : "Christophe Tellier, a plumber in the town of Fréjus, when asked about immigration, brought up the so-called harkis, Algerians who fought alongside the French military during the war and who immigrated to France afterward.",
		"13" : "“It was Algeria that was the problem,” Mr. Tellier said. “And now the children of the harkis, they are a problem.”",
		"14" : "He added: “These immigrants, I hope they won’t have all these advantages that they have the right to now. I hope they’ll be taken away.”",
		"15" : "Much as in the American South, memory of defeat has blurred with its present-day social consequences. French citizens lost their once-superior status over Muslim and Arab subjects, a transition that today colors the debate over immigration and the treatment of France’s Muslim communities.",
		"16" : "Algeria, Mr. Stora said, has become a way to express “nostalgia for a lost era, for an era when there was a hierarchy based on ethnicity.”",
		"17" : "Terrence Peterson, a historian at Florida International University, compared debates over Algeria to those over the Confederate flag in the United States.",
		"18" : "“History is a way to talk about France’s relationship with its minority population,” Mr. Peterson said. “Like the Confederate flag, it means very different things to different people.”",
		"19" : "For those who see immigration or the European Union as an assault on French identity, Algeria provides a memory of a time when France was great and a way to argue against compromising that greatness ever again, whether by bowing to the European Union or broadening French identity to accept newcomers.",
		"20" : "Ms. Le Pen has skillfully played on that nostalgia, saying colonialism “brought a lot, especially to Algeria.”",
		"21" : "After Emmanuel Macron, her centrist opponent for the presidency, called France’s actions in Algeria a “crime against humanity” and “part of this past that we must face” during a trip there, he faced a chorus of criticism. Gérald Darmanin, a mayor and member of the center-right Republicans, accused Mr. Macron of “spitting on the graves” of those who died in Algeria “for a France they loved.”",
		"22" : "The Algerian war divided France between two visions of the nation that play out in politics today, Mr. Stora said.",
		"23" : "One vision defined France through its revolutionary values, particularly equality and liberty, which many saw as in tension with colonial rule.",
		"24" : "The 130 years of rule in Algeria culminated in an imperial identity that blended values like secularism with nationalism and the racial hierarchies of colonialism.",
		"25" : "The dispute over whether to stay in Algeria brought France to the brink of a civil war that was averted by withdrawing from North Africa. But the cultural and identity issues were never resolved",
		"26" : "The divisions were deepened by the sudden arrival of about one million pieds-noirs and thousands of harkis, followed by more Algerians who went to France to work. The ideological conflict for French identity, far from ended, was imported onto French soil.",
		"27" : "Jean-Yves Camus, an analyst at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, traced the National Front’s roots to popular opposition to leaving Algeria, culminating in a failed coup by military leaders. Ms. Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie, who founded the party, grew that “spark” of far-right activity into the National Front, Mr. Camus said.",
		"28" : "Jennifer Sessions, a historian at the University of Iowa, said French far-right politicians used the language of colonization to talk about fears of immigration, warning that France is at risk of being “colonized” by immigrants.",
		"29" : "The National Front also draws subtle parallels between the Algerian independence fighters and disorder in immigrant neighborhoods today.",
		"30" : "The left also uses Algeria as a metaphor, drawing a parallel between colonial-era abuses and the policing of Muslims today.",
		"31" : "But the heat of those arguments might obscure a deeper problem: Debates over integration of immigrants cannot be resolved without agreement over the core values into which new arrivals must integrate.",
		"32" : "That question was raised in Algeria, but never answered. Some argued that Algerians could integrate only if they gave up their faith and culture, others that French Christians would have to widen their sense of identity to make room, and others still that France was only for the French.",
		"33" : "This disagreement continues to divide French politics, though they are now argued in the subtler language of integration and secularism.",
		"34" : "“Marine Le Pen uses the vocabulary of the Republic, but in a colonial sense,” Mr. Stora said, referring to colonial-era demands that Algerians make themselves culturally French. The effect, he said, is still that outsiders “cannot access the Republic.”",
		"35" : "When Charles de Gaulle, the nationalist president, withdrew from Algeria in defeat in 1962, he opened a divide between the French center right and far right that never closed.",
		"36" : "De Gaulle’s enormous popularity led center-right voters to support him in abandoning Algeria. But the far right never forgave him.",
		"37" : "“They wanted to kill de Gaulle, physically,” Mr. Stora said of the far right in the early 1960s. “There were four assassination attempts against him.”",
		"38" : "Ever since, mainstream politicians have struggled to reconcile national grievance over Algeria with the establishment position that de Gaulle was correct to withdraw.",
		"39" : "The National Front, long one of Europe’s most popular far-right parties, thrived by taking up that French nationalism as its own.",
		"40" : "This anger echoes Continentwide populist rage at the European Union and at elites who are said to have sold out the people. But it has been particularly loud in France, amplified by lingering humiliation and nostalgia over a national identity that is said to have been lost in a stretch of North Africa that was once French."

		"1" : "PARIS — France’s  presidential campaign entered its last week on Monday, coinciding with May Day labor demonstrations around the country that reflected a split among unions over whether to endorse Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate, against Marine Le Pen, his far-right opponent.",
		"2" : "More than 140,000 people participated in rallies in Paris, Lille, Marseille and other cities — events organized by French labor unions, some of which have found themselves in a bind ahead of the vote in the second and final round of the presidential election on Sunday.",
		"3" : "Although they have historically opposed Ms. Le Pen’s far-right National Front and have urged members to vote against her, several major labor unions also fought the job market overhauls that Mr. Macron defended as economy minister and that he wants to expand if elected.",
		"4" : "That has left unions split between those who have explicitly endorsed Mr. Macron, and those who have only called for votes against Ms. Le Pen.",
		"5" : "At a rally of his supporters in Paris on Monday, Mr. Macron reiterated his economic agenda and renewed calls for a “strong Europe.” But he said he would never “judge” a National Front voter, “because behind that vote there is always an anger, an outrage, a disappointment.”",
		"6" : "Though he condemned Ms. Le Pen for seeking to exploit voters’ anger, Mr. Macron seemed to play to the same deep anxieties on Monday when he told the BBC that if elected he would have “to listen to our people, and to listen to the fact that they are extremely angry today, impatient, and the dysfunction of the E.U. is no more sustainable.”",
		"7" : "Mr. Macron said that he was “pro-European,” but that if elected he would “reform in-depth the European Union and our European project,” lest he “betray” the French people.",
		"8" : "“I don’t want to do so, because the day after, we will have a ‘Frexit,’” he said, referring to a French exit from the European Union, “or we will have the Front National again.”",
		"9" : "Many on the French left, including union advocates who oppose the National Front, say the economic policies defended by Mr. Macron — free trade and a desire to loosen labor regulations — have fueled the National Front’s success.",
		"10" : "Those voters, many of whom supported the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round, do not want their votes for Mr. Macron to be construed as support for his platform. The latest polls have shown an increase in the number of voters who say they plan to abstain in the second round.",
		"11" : "In Paris on Monday, the unions that supported Mr. Marcon and opposed Ms. Le Pen marched separately, in stark contrast to 2002, when the different labor unions united to oppose Ms. Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie, after he made it into the second round of the presidential elections.",
		"12" : "Philippe Martinez, the head of the General Confederation of Labor, one of France’s biggest unions, told the newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday that while his and other unions agreed on opposing the National Front, “we are not in 2002 anymore.”",
		"13" : "At the bigger demonstration on Monday in Paris, unions marched for workers’ rights and against Ms. Le Pen, without calling for support for Mr. Macron. Other demonstrators carried signs that read “No to Macron” and “No to Le Pen,” and some chanted “abolish the Macron law” or “abolish the labor law.”",
		"14" : "Some hooded protesters clashed with the police on the sidelines of the demonstrations, throwing rocks and firebombs at the officers, who responded with tear gas. Five riot police officers were wounded in the clashes, the Paris police prefecture said.",
		"15" : "Demonstrators at a smaller rally organized earlier on Monday in Paris by more moderate labor unions, who have endorsed Mr. Macron, said voters had to choose.",
		"16" : "“Although we don’t support the politics of Macron, we advise our followers to vote for him, because we don’t want Le Pen,” said Olivier Belem, 56, a computer technician and union member. “The fact that the other unions don’t give voters clear advice will leave open the possibility of a blank vote and will help Le Pen in her chances of victory.”",
		"17" : "Analysts predict that  abstentions could help Ms. Le Pen, especially if left-wing voters reluctant to vote for Mr. Macron stay home on Election Day. The latest polls suggest that Mr. Macron could beat Ms. Le Pen with roughly 60 percent of the vote in the second round.",
		"18" : "On Monday, Mr. Macron also paid tribute to Brahim Bouarram, a 29-year-old man who was killed during a far-right demonstration in Paris on May 1, 1995, by skinheads who pushed him off a bridge and into the Seine. Mr. Bouarram’s son, who was 9 at the time of his father’s death, joined Mr. Macron as they laid flowers at a memorial plaque.",
		"19" : "It was the latest attempt by Mr. Macron to draw attention to the National Front’s anti-Semitic and racist roots, from which Ms. Le Pen has tried to distance herself.",

		"23" : "“He talks about the future, but he has no children; he talks about workers, but he’s a former banker at Rothschild; he wants to revitalize the economy, but he’s one of those who dynamited it,” Mr. Le Pen said.",
		"24" : "Ms. Le Pen, who announced last week that she would name a former right-wing rival prime minister if elected, said on Monday at a campaign rally near Paris that Mr. Macron was the candidate of “finance” and that he was an “adversary of the people.”",

		"1" : "HAWARDEN, Wales — Flitting from the origins of mountaineering to the writing skills of recent archbishops, the bookish talk at the breakfast table seemed to suit the setting. Overlooking it all hung two portraits of Britain’s high-minded 19th-century Liberal prime minister, William Gladstone, staring down with a severe look.",
		"2" : "The restaurant at Gladstone’s Library, close to the border between Wales and England, is called Food for Thought, and the caterers have been busy recently.",
		"3" : "Interest has surged in an institution that houses Gladstone’s books and papers and that sees itself as a temple of liberal values, delighting its director, Peter Francis, who believes the trend is a reaction to the rise of populism in Britain.",
		"4" : "Last year, Britons voted to quit the European Union after a notably shallow referendum debate. Now, a badly divided electorate faces a general election at a time when politicians are generally held in low esteem and amid anxieties about the spread of fake news.",
		"5" : "So this unique residential institution — in contrast to recent American presidents, Gladstone is the only British leader to have established a library — sees itself as a refuge, Mr. Francis said, and one that is being “hugely used at the moment by people who feel the loss of liberal values.”",
		"6" : "Four times prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone was first elected to Parliament in 1832, age 23, as a Tory, but he became leader of the Liberal party in 1867, expanding the voting franchise and championing Irish home rule. Whereas his archrival, Benjamin Disraeli, charmed Queen Victoria, Gladstone tended to do the opposite, so much so that the monarch complained that he addressed her as if she were a public meeting.",
		"7" : "Yet his scholarly and sober approach may be having a revival.",
		"8" : "Reading room visitors increased by 25 percent to 50 percent in each of the first three months of 2017 over last year, and there was an overall 29 percent increase in overnight stays by scholars, writers and others in the same period.",
		"9" : "Fund-raising is underway for a $10 million plan to build an auditorium for literary festivals, to improve video capabilities and to upgrade more basic facilities, including the women’s restrooms.",
		"10" : "But the idea is to retain the ambience of a place where visitors sometimes feel as if they have stepped from a divided and ill-tempered Britain into a 19th century vicarage.",
		"11" : "Sitting in his book-lined office, Mr. Francis, whose formal title is warden, said that as a committed internationalist, Gladstone would have been “very upset” about Britain’s exit from the European Union. He thinks it fair to assume that a politician whose speeches could last four hours would have been unimpressed by President Trump’s Twitter feed.",
		"12" : "As for fake news, Mr. Francis added, Gladstone would have been horrified. “I can’t think of any single thing that is more un-Gladstonian,” he said, noting that the statesman prized “deep study and doing your proper research and in some depth, so that you would get all the nuances.”",
		"13" : "Evidence of scholarship is all around in this imposing library, built in the first years of the 20th century in Gothic style on the site of the more basic structure — the “Tin Tabernacle” — that Gladstone built in 1889 to house his 32,000 books. Though he turned 80 that year, he helped to move them there in wheelbarrows from nearby Hawarden (pronounced Harden) Castle, his grand country home.",
		"14" : "A devout Christian, Gladstone became well known for his rescue work among prostitutes, but his contacts with “fallen women” provoked gossip and speculation. His reputation for intellectual rigor is rarely questioned, however. Mr. Francis recounts how when asked to cut the ribbon to open a flower show, Gladstone read for weeks about flora and delivered a lengthy oration.",
		"15" : "Augmented with newer works, Gladstone’s Library now holds more than 200,000 books, journals and periodicals, concentrating on history, literature and theology.",
		"16" : "Access is free, which has made the library a popular place of study for local teenagers preparing for exams. It also has 26 bedrooms, with reduced prices for authors, clergy and students, and there is often a writer in residence.",
		"17" : "While anyone can reserve a bed, this is not an ordinary hotel. The rooms, while comfortable, are equipped with a retro-style radio, but no TV. Downstairs, in a spacious sitting room, the bar is not staffed; guests are expected to display another Gladstonian quality — integrity — by signing for what they consume.",
		"18" : "Along the corridor, under the wooden beams of the large, light and airy main reading room, silence is strictly observed, the only distraction being the thousands of surrounding volumes (one visitor recalls being sidetracked from work by “The Book of British Fish.”)",
		"19" : "In addition to his books, Gladstone’s personal papers are here, including his marriage proposal, whose romantic intent was somewhat opaque: It is a letter that includes a sentence of 141 words, with 18 clauses or subclauses.",
		"20" : "The library’s many admirers include David Cannadine, the Dodge professor of history at Princeton and a trustee, who describes it as “a very remarkable and special place, both in terms of what it is and what it stands for.”",
		"21" : "“People can visit and stay and work in an environment which is simultaneously stimulating, secluded and serene,” he said, adding that “it also embodies those quintessential Gladstonian values of liberalism, tolerance, internationalism, democracy and belief in human rights and the rule of law.”",
		"22" : "“In our current climate, they need reaffirming, exploring and celebrating more than ever,” he said.",
		"23" : "Another trustee, Patrick Derham, headmaster of Westminster School, described the library as a “magical place,” which, “in an increasingly illiberal world, is even more important now than at any point in its existence.”",
		"24" : "Over dinner, the current writer in residence, the novelist Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, put the attraction differently: “When I was a kid, I always wanted to live in a library, then I discovered that there is a library, and you can live in it.”",
		"25" : "Liz Simons, a textiles teacher from Cambridge, said she was visiting because of her 18-year-old son’s interest in Victorian history. As a supporter of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party, he may not be typical of Gladstone’s Library users, though she thinks exposure to it may be making him a little more liberal.",
		"26" : "Originally, the library was named after the nearby church, St. Deiniol’s, which contains several plaques commemorating the Gladstone family. (William Gladstone, who died at Hawarden Castle in 1898, is buried in Westminster Abbey.)",
		"27" : "The library’s warden must be a member of the clergy, and there is a regular communion service at 8 a.m., though Mr. Francis said that there was “no expectation that people go,” and described this as “old-fashioned Anglicanism that goes on like the breathing of the house.”",
		"28" : "Mr. Francis remembered being “terribly scornful” that his predecessor stayed in the job for 21 years, yet he is now at the start of his own second decade in the post and seems destined to outdo the record. Not that this means he has become complacent, he added.",
		"29" : "“We have a lot of images of Gladstone, and I do find him quite stern,” he said. “You can’t quite loll about doing nothing with Gladstone looking over you. You feel you should be doing something solidly and seriously.”"

		"1" : "Malcolm Toon was a leading State Department expert on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold War, a blunt ambassador with a reputation as a hard-liner in diplomatic duels with Communist governments.",
		"2" : "In nearly 35 years as a Foreign Service officer, he was ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Israel and most notably, the Soviet Union.",
		"3" : "Yet for all his prominence in the halls of power, in Washington and Moscow, his death at a hospital in Pinehurst, N.C., eight years ago at 92 — some 30 years after he had retired and many years after he had dropped from public view — went largely unreported.",
		"4" : "The news did circulate in and around his hometown, Southern Pines, N.C., in early 2009. The Toon family provided a notice to the Powell Funeral Home there, announcing that Mr. Toon had died on Feb. 12, and The Pilot, the local newspaper, published an obituary.",
		"5" : "Outside of local coverage, The Foreign Service Journal, published by the American Foreign Service Association, reported his death in its April 2009 edition, but its readers are largely diplomatic professionals.",
		"6" : "No national news organization carried his obituary. The New York Times, for one, was never informed of his death, either by the family or the State Department, though it had prepared an obituary in advance three years earlier. His death was confirmed after a Times editor chanced upon an online reference to it.",
		"7" : "Mr. Toon’s son, Alan, reached on Friday, said he did not recall anyone in his family having notified the State Department of his father’s death.",
		"8" : "Mr. Toon was fluent in Russian, and his appointment in the last weeks of President Gerald R. Ford’s administration was in line with a tradition of experienced diplomats serving as the American envoy in Moscow. But the Russians considered him hostile and delayed formally approving his appointment. In his first months in office, in 1977, President Jimmy Carter backed off from Ford’s selection of Mr. Toon, but then went ahead with it.",
		"9" : "Mr. Toon was characterized in The Times in December 1978 as becoming “one of the most influential of the postwar ambassadors in shaping the policy of the United States toward the Soviet Union.”",
		"10" : "He considered his steely image to be a simplification, but in his nearly three years in Moscow he displayed a penchant for hard-edged remarks.",
		"11" : "Robin Knight, the Moscow bureau chief of U.S. News & World Report during most of Mr. Toon’s tenure there, recalled in a Foreign Service Journal article in 2011 that Mr. Toon had told American correspondents at his first briefing, “I think my job is to teach these guys how to act like a great power instead of some two-bit banana republic.”",
		"12" : "His briefings were off the record, but Mr. Toon could be outspoken in public settings as well. Annoyed by the absence of senior Soviet officials at a 1979 Fourth of July embassy reception (it was also Mr. Toon’s 63rd birthday), he told Americans gathered there, “Sometimes over the past 20 years I have had the impression that we’re dealing with a bunch of clods.”",
		"13" : "Two years before, the Soviet government had refused to allow Mr. Toon to deliver the American ambassador’s traditional Fourth of July talk on Russian television because his text — in line with the Carter administration’s concerns about human rights violations — stated that Americans hoped “violations of these rights, wherever they may occur, will end.”",
		"14" : "Notwithstanding Mr. Toon’s toughness toward the Russians, he was cautious at the same time. He was disturbed when the Carter administration used strong language toward Moscow, and he was wary of Washington’s supporting Soviet dissidents too strongly.",
		"15" : "Mr. Toon took part in negotiating SALT II with the Soviet Union, an agreement that limited offensive strategic weapons, but he was dismayed when Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance bypassed him in negotiating the pact’s final details with the longtime Soviet ambassador to Washington, Anatoly F. Dobrynin.",
		"16" : "When the treaty was signed in Vienna in June 1979 by President Carter and the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Mr. Toon angered the White House by publicly questioning whether it provided a sufficient means to verify Soviet compliance. But he soon announced his support for the treaty, saying the Pentagon had eased his fears. In the end, President Carter removed the treaty from Senate consideration and it was not ratified.",
		"17" : "When Mr. Toon had arrived for the SALT II summit meeting, he was stunned to learn that President Carter planned to appoint Thomas J. Watson Jr., a former chairman of I.B.M., to succeed him. Mr. Toon had planned to retire soon, and he would do so that October, but he further irritated the White House when he was openly critical of the practice of giving ambassadorships to political supporters and others who had no background in the Foreign Service.",
		"18" : "“For me and others at the embassy, Toon was a fearsome presence,” James Schumaker, a Foreign Service officer who worked under him in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, wrote in a memoir of his time in Belgrade. “Everyone at that post seemed to be a little bit afraid of him, myself included.”",
		"19" : "Malcolm Toon was one of four children of George Toon, a stonecutter, and his wife, Margaret. He was born on July 4, 1916, in Troy, N.Y., a few years after his parents had emigrated from Scotland. The Toon family returned there when he was 6, then came back to the United States and settled in Northborough, Mass., about 35 miles west of Boston.",
		"20" : "Mr. Toon graduated from Tufts University in 1937 and received a master’s degree from its Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1938.",
		"21" : "He commanded a PT boat in the Pacific during World War II, then joined the State Department. He served in Poland, Haiti and Hungary, received Russian-language training and had stints in the Moscow embassy in the 1950s and ’60s.",
		"22" : "Mr. Toon was the third-ranking embassy official in Moscow in 1965 when a Communist publication accused him of heading an American spy ring, evidently a response to Washington’s previous expulsion of Russia’s No. 3 diplomat there in a spy case. The accusations were denied, and Mr. Toon was not expelled. In the late 1960s, he headed the State Department’s office of Soviet affairs.",
		"23" : "President Richard M. Nixon named Mr. Toon ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1969. He became ambassador to Yugoslavia in 1971 and helped promote American investments there. He later told of forging a close personal relationship with the Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito.",
		"24" : "Mr. Toon was named ambassador to Israel in the spring of 1975 by President Ford. A few months later, in an interview with Israeli Army radio, he advised Israelis to “tighten your belts and temper your appetites” before seeking large aid packages from America.",
		"25" : "The remark brought a flurry of letters to The Jerusalem Post, some criticizing Mr. Toon but others backing him. Israel’s foreign minister, Yigal Allon, remarked that Mr. Toon was “the kind of ambassador we want”: a professional with influence at the State Department. The Times quoted one Israeli official as saying, “He’s a most undiplomatic diplomat, and I like him for it.”",
		"26" : "Mr. Toon drew a rebuke from the State Department in October 1975 over a speech he had given in Haifa, Israel, two days earlier, when he said that the Egyptian president, Anwar el-Sadat, “had chosen to embarrass the president of the United States” with anti-Jewish remarks at a Washington luncheon. He also speculated about the possibility of American intervention in Lebanon over Muslim-Christian strife. But a Reuters report from Washington said a department spokesman had not specified how Mr. Toon had departed from United States policy.",
		"27" : "In the 1990s, Mr. Toon was co-chairman of the American delegation to the newly created United States-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIA Affairs, which was charged with investigating the fate of American prisoners of war and those missing in action from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Cold War.",
		"28" : "Mr. Toon was survived by his son, Alan; his daughters Nancy Toon and Barbara Lindenbaum; and three grandchildren. His wife, the former Elizabeth Jane Taylor, died in 1996 at 77. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, alongside her.",
		"29" : "While Mr. Toon was ambassador to the Soviet Union, his daughters presented him with a T-shirt embroidered with the word “Hard-liner.”",
		"30" : "But in a speech in Philadelphia in September 1977, he expressed a more nuanced view. On the one hand he defined the thaw in American-Soviet relations known as détente as “a growing sense in this nuclear age of the need to cooperate on some matters, to regulate competition on others and to agree on the means of defusing tensions which could lead to dangerous confrontation.”",
		"31" : "On the other, he said, “I do not hold with the fuzzy-headed notion that all we have to do is sit down and reason with the Soviets and everything will be all right.”"

		"6" : "It was not immediately clear why the police had detained the activists. Among them was Igor Kochetkov, director of the Russian LGBT Network, a group that has been providing gay men from Chechnya with safe houses elsewhere in Russia.",
		"7" : "Tens of thousands of people in Russia attend May Day parades, which are intended to highlight labor issues and defend the rights of workers. In Moscow, Gennady A. Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, gave a speech in front of a poster of Joseph Stalin.",

		"1" : "LONDON — No one expects negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union to go smoothly over the next two years, but a German newspaper’s account of a dinner last Wednesday between the British prime minister, Theresa May, and senior European Union officials suggests that round one, at least, was particularly discordant.",
		"2" : "On Sunday, the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, ran an article, clearly leaked by officials in the European Commission, that described a considerable gulf between Mrs. May, who called for a snap election on June 8, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the commission, as well as the bloc’s chief negotiator on Britain’s exit, Michel Barnier.",
		"3" : "According to the German newspaper and some from Britain, like The Sunday Times of London, Mr. Juncker came away believing that Mrs. May was not just in “a state of denial,” but in “a different galaxy,” as he was said to have reported in an early morning telephone call the next day to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.",
		"4" : "The paper reported that Mrs. May said at one point, “Let’s make Brexit a success.” Mr. Juncker was said to have replied, “Brexit cannot be a success.”",
		"5" : "Mrs. May was said to have called for working on a trade deal simultaneously with talks on Britain’s exit, arguing that since Britain is already a member and merely wants to leave, a trade deal should be much easier to complete.",
		"6" : "Mr. Juncker somewhat theatrically dismissed the idea, reaching into his bag and pulling out two big stacks of paper: Croatia’s European Union entry deal and Canada’s free-trade pact, all 2,250 pages of it.",
		"7" : "The two sides also differed on the question of how much Britain will have to pay as part of the “divorce settlement,” with Mrs. May reportedly saying it owes nothing because there is no mention of such payments in the European Union’s founding treaties.",
		"8" : "Mr. Juncker was said to have replied that without a payment there would be no trade deal.",
		"9" : "Ms. Merkel was concerned enough to issue a strong statement to the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament, on Thursday, saying that Britain can work out a new relationship with the European Union only after it leaves. “I must say this clearly here because I get the feeling that some people in Britain still have illusions — that would be wasted time,” she warned.",
		"10" : "She added: “We can only do an agreement on the future relationship with Britain when all questions about its exit have been cleared up satisfactorily,” while pointing out that serious negotiations could not start until after the British elections in June.",
		"11" : "The reports on Sunday were detailed enough — and one-sided enough — that officials at 10 Downing Street issued an official statement on Monday, a holiday in Britain, rejecting the German newspaper’s version. “We do not recognize this account,” the statement said. “As the prime minister and Jean-Claude Juncker made clear, this was a constructive meeting ahead of the negotiations formally getting underway.”",
		"12" : "On Sunday, on television news talk shows, Mrs. May acknowledged that the talks would be difficult but said to the BBC, “I’m not in a different galaxy, but I think what this shows, and what some of the other comments we’ve seen coming from European leaders shows, is that there are going to be times when these negotiations are going to be tough.”",
		"13" : "She insisted that Britain could secure a comprehensive trade deal with the European Union alongside the divorce negotiations and complete everything in two years, with an “implementation period.”",
		"14" : "Brussels officials regard that as unrealistic and point to the bloc’s “Brexit” negotiating guidelines, which mandate that talks on a future relationship can begin only after “sufficient progress” has been on three major issues: guaranteeing the rights of citizens of European Union member states living in Britain; settling the divorce bill; and safeguarding the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.",
		"15" : "Mrs. May, who wants to resolve speedily the post-exit status of member-state citizens in Britain and British citizens in the bloc, suggested the issue could be settled at a summit meeting at the end of June. Mr. Juncker and his top officials considered that timetable unworkable given what they consider the complications of pensions, legal rights and the right to health care.",
		"16" : "The issue is especially complicated because Mrs. May wants the exit to end the jurisdiction in Britain of the European Court of Justice, but it is that court that currently settles legal disputes among member states.",
		"17" : "Britain also wants complete secrecy for the negotiations, which Brussels believes violates the principle of transparency — and as the various newspaper accounts prove, leaks will be numerous in any case.",
		"18" : "While the dinner was about opening stances in the talks, the gaps reportedly made Mr. Juncker more skeptical that a deal could be done in two years, before Britain leaves the bloc, making a “hard Brexit” more likely. “I leave Downing Street 10 times as skeptical as I was before” about a deal, Mr. Juncker reportedly told Mrs. May as he left the dinner."

		"13" : "The United States also has repeatedly asked Iran about Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent who disappeared in Iran a decade ago. The Iranians have said they know nothing of his whereabouts or fate, despite suspicions by Mr. Levinson’s family that he is a captive.",
		"14" : "Advocates for the Namazis have been especially outspoken about calling for their release. Last week during the Vienna meeting, Baquer Namazi’s other son, Babak Namazi, joined with their lawyer, Jared Genser, at a news conference to denounce what they called the “intense, unrelenting, cruel and inhuman treatment” of the Namazis.",

		"16" : "In a Twitter message in October, when the Namazis were both sentenced, Mr. Trump vowed, “This doesn’t happen if I’m president!”",
		"17" : "Mr. Trump has also denounced the Iranian nuclear accord as “the worst deal ever” and has hinted that he would seek to renegotiate or scrap it. But political analysts have suggested that he will honor terms of the deal, which eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for its verifiable pledge of peaceful nuclear work."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "BEIRUT, Lebanon — Last month’s chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held Syrian town may have caught the world’s — and President Trump’s — attention, but it was not the only recent suspected use of a nerve agent by Syrian government forces.",
		"2" : "On three other occasions in the months leading up to the attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, witnesses, doctors and human rights investigators say, government attacks left scores of people sickened with similar symptoms, like foaming at the mouth, shaking and paralysis — including two attacks in December, little noticed at the time, that killed at least 64 people.",
		"3" : "New information about the additional attacks appears in a Human Rights Watch report released Monday, bolstering New York Times reporting on those episodes and placing Khan Sheikhoun in the context of wider evidence that the Syrian government continues to use chemical weapons despite its 2013 agreement to give them up.",
		"4" : "Despite the missile strike Mr. Trump ordered on the Syrian military airfield he said was the source of the Khan Sheikhoun attack, Syrian forces are doubling down on tactics that constitute war crimes, including bombing hospitals and rescue and medical workers and using chemical weapons, according to the report and other witness accounts.",
		"5" : "The Syrian government and its main ally, Russia, deny that it uses such tactics.",
		"6" : "At a news conference held at United Nations headquarters in New York to release the report’s findings, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, ridiculed what he described as “preposterous” assertions by the Syrian and Russian governments denying responsibility.",
		"7" : "Mr. Roth said it was time for them “to stop these transparently false diversionary claims and come clean.”",
		"8" : "He also said the pattern of attacks as described in the Human Rights Watch report amounted to “a level of culpability and horror that cries out for prosecution.”",
		"9" : "So far, Russia has used its Security Council veto to block investigations of war crimes in Syria in the International Criminal Court. But even without a Security Council referral to the court, an accountability mechanism created last year by the General Assembly can be used to look into the allegations. United Nations officials told reporters on Monday in New York and Geneva that the work could begin soon, and that member states have raised half of the required $13 million initial budget.",
		"10" : "Mr. Roth expressed impatience for the secretary general, António Guterres, to appoint a prosecutor, but Mr. Guterres’s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said the process was underway, adding, “I don’t think the secretary general is dragging his feet.”",
		"11" : "On Saturday, an attack on a headquarters of the White Helmets civil defense rescue group in the town of Kafr Zita killed eight of its members, the group and other witnesses say. And medical organizations working in Syria have tallied 10 government attacks in April alone on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held areas, part of a pattern of hundreds of attacks on medical workers and facilities that United Nations investigators have described as war crimes.",
		"12" : "Human Rights Watch corroborated claims of two suspected nerve gas attacks on Dec. 12 that initially went relatively unnoticed. This was in part because they took place when the world’s attention was focused on the battle over  Aleppo, and in part because of the difficulty of verifying information in the Islamic State-held areas where they occurred.",
		"13" : "Medical organizations and social media accounts that day shared images of dead children bearing no visible wounds, as if sleeping, like those killed by a nerve agent in Khan Sheikhoun and in 2013 attacks near Damascus. But because people can be killed for sharing information online from Islamic State-controlled areas, it was difficult to verify them at the time.",
		"14" : "Human Rights Watch said its investigators interviewed four residents by telephone and two medics through intermediaries. It said they gave consistent accounts of chemical weapons attacks in two villages in eastern Hama Province, amid clashes between government and Islamic State forces, that killed residents sheltering in caves and in their homes.",
		"15" : "The report also provides new details about the Khan Sheikhoun attack, as well as about an intensifying series of recent government bombings and shelling illegally using chlorine gas, with barrels dropped from helicopters and, in a new method, with improvised ground-to-ground missiles.",
		"16" : "In those cases, too, the findings coincide with accounts residents and witnesses gave to The Times and with a Times analysis of public information online.",
		"17" : "Human Rights Watch corroborated eight chlorine attacks this year, out of a larger number reported by residents. Possession of chlorine, unlike sarin, is not illegal under international law, but its use as a weapon is. The attacks took place in areas where government forces were clashing with rebel forces, near the cities of Damascus and Hama.",
		"18" : "The intense battles around Hama led to three attacks, two believed to be with chlorine and one believed to be with a nerve agent, in the two weeks before the Khan Sheikhoun attack. All of them were in al-Lataminah, a town in Hama Province between Khan Sheikhoun and the front line.",
		"19" : "On March 25, ordnance crashed through the roof of a clinic that, because of previous attacks, had been reinforced with a metal roof covered with earth. Yellowish gas smelling of bleach filled the facility, killing a doctor, Ali Darwish, as he performed surgery, as well as his patient and another person, according to the Human Rights Watch report and other witnesses. On April 3, munitions with a similar smell again hit the village, injuring at least a dozen.",
		"20" : "On March 30, a bomb fell without the usual intense explosion — chemical weapons typically contain a smaller explosive charge, to disperse but not destroy the agent — injuring 169 people, many but not all of them believed to be combatants. They reported symptoms similar to those from a nerve agent, including pupils constricted to pinpoints.",
		"21" : "In the Dec. 12 attacks, two villages, Jrouh and al-Salaliyah, were hit, Human Rights Watch said. It quoted a Jrouh resident who said he found his wife, three children, brother, brother’s wife and brother’s three children dead in his basement. He said his neighbors, his uncle and the families of his uncle’s two sons also died.",
		"22" : "“Everyone within 100 meters died,” he told the rights group. “There was no one left.” He buried his family and fled, and was interviewed by Human Rights Watch after finding refuge outside Islamic State territory.",
		"23" : "Human Rights Watch interviewed 32 residents of Khan Sheikhoun and reviewed available evidence, corroborating previous accounts that one bomb containing a chemical agent fell after a warplane passed over before 7 a.m. on April 4, followed by three or four explosive bombs dropped in a second bombing run.",
		"24" : "It found that bomb fragments from the scene of the suspected chemical bomb matched those of a Soviet-made munition that delivers sarin, the KhAB-250.",
		"25" : "Human Rights Watch said it found no evidence for the version of events provided by Russia: that government warplanes bombed a warehouse holding chemical agents stored by rebel groups. Corroborating reporting by The Times and The Guardian, it found that the only buildings near the small crater left by the suspected chemical bomb were abandoned, sustained no new damage, and were open to the air and could not have concealed a chemical weapons store."

		"1" : "JERUSALEM — Hamas, the militant group built around violent resistance to Israel, sought on Monday to present a more moderate public face, taking its next shot in an intensifying struggle for leadership of the Palestinian cause and international recognition.",
		"2" : "Released by Hamas just days before its chief rival, the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, was to meet President Trump, a new document of principles for the group calls for closer ties to Egypt, waters down the anti-Semitic language from its charter, and accepts at least a provisional Palestinian state — though it still does not formally recognize Israel.",
		"3" : "With its statement, Hamas is trying to offer a more mainstream-friendly version of its vision for the Palestinian cause, and to gain ground against Mr. Abbas, whose influence is growing more tenuous.",
		"4" : "Mr. Abbas is 82 years old, and his rivals within his own Fatah movement are increasingly open about the struggle to succeed him. Seeking to regain the initiative, he has recently waged a crackdown on Hamas, cutting salaries due to them from the Palestinian Authority and refusing to pay for electricity in the militant group’s power base in Gaza.",
		"5" : "The split between the two groups — Fatah in the West Bank, Hamas in Gaza — has stood as one of the major obstacles in the peace process with Israel: Who, the Israelis ask, is their partner if the Palestinians are so deeply divided? That division has also been convenient for, and encouraged by, those on the Israeli right who do not want a peace deal.",
		"6" : "But the Hamas document, which has been leaking for weeks, is less a change in Hamas’s fundamental beliefs than a challenge for the credibility of Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank, as well as internationally.",
		"7" : "“Whether it’s a coincidence or it’s connected, I have one thing to say: The Palestinian leadership is afraid of this Hamas moderation,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Al-Azhar University-Gaza. “Because the P.A. and Fatah are afraid that by this moderation, Hamas presents itself as the true representation of the Palestinian people,” he said, referring to the Palestinian Authority.",
		"8" : "The official release came at a telling time and place: Hamas officials, normally secretive, held several events on Monday in Doha, the capital of Qatar, an American ally that would play a crucial role in a deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, which Mr. Trump is pushing.",
		"9" : "Mr. Abbas was scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on Wednesday as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.",
		"10" : "Experts on all sides of the complex struggle here say the new document is unlikely to represent any profound change in Hamas’s true position toward Israel. The group recently chose a hard-liner, Yehya Sinwar, as its new leader in Gaza, and it has still in no way recognized Israel or renounced violence.",
		"11" : "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel quickly denounced the move. “Hamas’s document is a smoke screen,” he said in a statement. “We see Hamas continuing to invest all of its resources not just in preparing for war with Israel, but also in educating the children of Gaza to want to destroy Israel.”",
		"12" : "Hamas is still considered a terrorist group by much of the West, including the United States, a status that has led to its exclusion from wider international talks about the Palestinians’ future.",
		"13" : "Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said the group had to move beyond its original charter to achieve its goals. “The document gives us a chance to connect with the outside world,” he said. “To the world, our message is: Hamas is not radical. We are a pragmatic and civilized movement. We do not hate the Jews. We only fight who occupies our lands and kills our people.”",
		"14" : "The document is a distillation of various public statements over the years signaling an attempt by Hamas to appear more pragmatic since it seized broad control of Gaza in 2007, after winning parliamentary elections a year earlier. Four years in the drafting, the document represents the consensus of Hamas’s top leadership.",
		"15" : "The paper calls for Hamas to distance itself from the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to build stronger ties with Egypt, which controls the Gaza Strip’s southern border. It reiterates the Hamas leadership’s view that it is open to a Palestinian state along the borders established after the 1967 war, though it does not renounce future claims to Palestinian rule over what is now Israel. And the group specifically weakened language from its 1988 charter proclaiming Jews as enemies and comparing their views to Nazism, though the new document does not replace the original charter.",
		"16" : "“Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish, but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine,” the new document states.",
		"17" : "Mr. Abbas is increasingly unpopular at home, though he is the recognized conduit to the wider world, and the race for succession is clearly heating up. And while the well-trained Palestinian Authority security forces have kept a tight check on Hamas in the West Bank, Fatah always fears support or action waiting in the wings.",
		"18" : "In Fatah, Marwan Barghouti, a popular figure among Palestinians who is serving five life sentences for murders in the second intifada, is leading a hunger strike in Israeli jails, now two weeks old, that some experts say is aimed at raising his credibility as a leader.",
		"19" : "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire for a peace process that brings in Sunni Arab nations aligned against Shiite Iran, itself allied with Hamas, even as Hamas seeks to become closer to those same Sunni nations.",
		"20" : "“The P.A. and Hamas compete to get embraced by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab states, but it seems the Arab embrace is not enough for two women,” said Fayez Abu Shamala, a Palestinian writer and political analyst close to Hamas.",
		"21" : "The new document, however, reveals a greater pragmatism and willingness to engage with the outside world, he said. “Hamas will be an influential political body in the next phase.”",
		"22" : "In Israel, which has fought three wars with Hamas since 2008, the document was greeted with skepticism.",
		"23" : "“Not even one mind” will be changed in Israel, said Yossi Kuperwasser, a retired Israeli brigadier general who led the army’s research arm. “Nobody will be affected by this.”",
		"24" : "Mr. Kuperwasser called it a “sugarcoating” of old positions that did not renounce Hamas’s original charter and did not recognize Israel’s right to exist. He did say, however, that it could be problematic for Mr. Abbas because the Palestinian Authority and Hamas platforms appear to be growing closer.",
		"25" : "In the document, Hamas reiterates that Palestinians who fled or were expelled during wars with Israelis have the right to return — largely a nonstarter in successive peace negotiations with Israel. And it does not renounce violence; “resistance” continues to be a main source of strength and credibility.",
		"26" : "“Hamas rejects any attempt to undermine the resistance and its arms. It also affirms the right of our people to develop the means and mechanisms of resistance,” the document says. “Hamas confirms that the resistance leadership can decide the level of resistance and can utilize a variety of the different tools and ways to administrate the conflict, without compromising the resistance.”",
		"27" : "In distancing itself from the Muslim Brotherhood, analysts said, Hamas was likely to improve its often-strained relationship with Egypt, even if it was unlikely to open the border between Egypt and Gaza for trade.",
		"28" : "“It’s a huge step for Hamas, but I think they should temper their expectations about the reaction from the Egyptians,” said Abdelrahman Ayyash, a researcher on Islamist movements who is based in Istanbul.",
		"29" : "Under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt frequently accuses Hamas of aiding Islamist militants in attacks against Egyptian security forces in Sinai and Egypt’s main cities. Egyptian security officials and pro-government news outlets accuse Hamas, often without proof, of providing militants with training and guns.",
		"30" : "At the same time, Egyptian intelligence has quietly renewed its relationship with Hamas in recent years, in an effort to secure Sinai and to bolster Egypt’s role as a mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
		"31" : "Before Mr. Abbas’s visit to Washington, the Egyptians are keen to establish their role as potential peacemakers. After a meeting between Mr. Sisi and Mr. Abbas in Cairo on Saturday, the Egyptian president’s office issued a statement that noted Egypt’s “pivotal role” and urged Palestinian unity as “essential to put an end to the plight of the Palestinian people.”"

		"2" : "I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO (2017) on iTunes and Amazon. Communing posthumously with the writer James Baldwin — and drawing on a book about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that he began sketching out in the mid-1970s but never completed — the director Raoul Peck creates “a thrilling introduction” to Baldwin’s work, “a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. With the heft of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop, this Oscar nominee for best documentary feature — narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, speaking words taken entirely from Baldwin’s pages — is “life-altering,” Mr. Scott added. Though Baldwin has been dead for nearly 30 years, “you would be hard-pressed to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history.”",

This new series plops modern families into dismal dwellings resembling 1860s London tenements, with five to a bedroom and a single outdoor toilet and water pump for all to share. The 16 participants, each with ancestral connections to the city’s working-class East End, spend three weeks living in these conditions and toiling the way their forebears did — making matchbooks, selling books and turning wood — as each episode propels them a decade into Britain’s future, and that much closer to welfare reform.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Institutions plagued by sexual assault scandals tend to look alike: They are usually insular organizations that resist external checks and revolve around authoritative men.",
		"2" : "This characterization fits Fox News, which recently fired its host Bill O’Reilly after sexual harassment allegations against him (and pressure from advertisers) mounted.",
		"3" : "But it is also applies to the white evangelical Christian community. This group is not a monolith, but its social hierarchy often functions like the military, a university or private business. It’s not a coincidence that conservative evangelical leaders tend to resist taking harassment and assault claims seriously.",
		"4" : "Eric Metaxas, a best-selling Christian author, tweeted after the firing that Mr. O’Reilly’s ouster was “tremendously sad” and that his show had been a “blessing to millions.” When people responding to his tweet noted that he was silent on the harassment itself, he wrote “Jesus loves Bill O’Reilly” and told his followers to pray for their enemies.",
		"5" : "Many Christian leaders responded to Donald Trump’s bragging about sexual assault with a similar line of defense. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, the country’s largest Christian college, said that “we’re all sinners” and that Mr. Trump had apologized. (In fact, Mr. Trump has said that he doesn’t ask God for forgiveness and didn’t need to ask his wife for it either.) Mr. Falwell later claimed to have proof that the women accusing Mr. Trump of sexual harassment were lying.",
		"6" : "David Brody, a correspondent with the Christian Broadcasting Network, excused Mr. Trump’s language at the time by saying, “We all sin every single day.” Jim Garlow, a prominent California pastor, refused to “cast any stones” at Mr. Trump, invoking Jesus’ teaching in the Gospel of John. He then called Hillary Clinton a modern-day Herod who would kill all the unborn babies if elected.",
		"7" : "Within the ranks of conservative church leadership, this default empathy for powerful men is coupled with tone deafness for victims. But the phenomenon is also a misapplication of the Christian teaching on forgiveness. Mr. Metaxas wrote a biography of the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, so he is surely familiar with his teaching on cheap grace — “the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance.” Cheap grace wrongly separates absolution of sin from acknowledgment of that sin. In Christian teaching, God forgives people before they confess wrongdoing. But among individuals, groups and nations, there can be no forgiveness when wrongdoing isn’t named.",
		"8" : "In cases of sexual assault, cheap grace is doubly dangerous: It can allow a guilty party to continue his abuse while victims stay silent in fear of punishment.",
		"9" : "In churches, a quick forgiveness for perpetrators often dovetails with strict standards of purity for women. From a young age, many Christian women are taught to dress modestly so as not to cause men to “stumble.” John Piper, a prominent pastor and theologian, has said that “a lot of Christian women are oblivious to the fact that they have some measure of responsibility” in managing men’s lust. The moralizing about dress and behavior can be a setup for victim-blaming wrapped in a spiritual veneer.",
		"10" : "Perhaps churches have been slow to address sex crimes out of a belief that such offenses couldn’t happen among their own. It’s assumed that the culture of harassment at a place like Fox News would never come to infect a community serving God. This thinking is both naïve and theologically irresponsible: Christians, of all people, acknowledge the depths of human depravity.",
		"11" : "In recent years, undeniable scandals at Bob Jones University, Sovereign Grace Church and Bill Gothard’s family ministry, among others, have awakened many conservative Christians to the reality of sexual assault in their own ranks. Boz Tchividjian, a grandson of the evangelist Billy Graham, is a law professor who runs Grace (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment). While the organization focuses on child abuse, Mr. Tchividjian speaks regularly on sex crimes in general. He critiques Christian organizations that respond to abuse with “institutional self-protection,” often by couching self-protection as “protecting the name of Christ.”",
		"12" : "If conservative Christians want to protect the faith — especially in a time when they fear loss of cultural power — they must show preferential care not for the powerful but for victims. They must be just as quick to extend empathy to women who have been harassed as they are to extend forgiveness to harassers.",
		"13" : "This is the hard work that epitomizes Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s conception of “costly grace.” An application of costly grace would mean showing perpetrators that their actions have real consequences. It would also ensure that victims are heard and given tools for healing long before there is any talk of restoring their abusers."

		"2" : "On the campaign trail and in office, President Trump proclaimed his determination to keep his administration free of lobbyists, foreign agents and special interests, who have “reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,” as he said in his inaugural address.",
		"3" : "A week later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order requiring executive branch employees to obey a list of rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest. But the order is rendered practically worthless by a clause allowing waivers to ethical rules for any White House staff, without any written explanation or public disclosure. That’s why the ethics office, which ensures that public servants enter government free from potential conflicts of interest, is demanding that the White House provide the names of executive branch officials who have received waivers, on what issues, by June 1.",
		"4" : "The Obama administration required that waivers to its anti-lobbying rules be accompanied by a detailed explanation written by administration ethics lawyers, and filed with the ethics office. In 2009, Republican Senator Charles Grassley, a veteran Senate investigator, demanded that the ethics office release the waivers. “The American people deserve a full accounting of all waivers and recusals to better understand who is running the government and whether the administration is adhering to its promise to be open, transparent, and accountable,” Mr. Grassley wrote.",
		"5" : "Now, in the absence of any action from Congress, the government ethics office is on its own with a White House that openly flouts ethical norms. Top-tier government and regulatory positions have gone to friends of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Coal, Big Pharma and for-profit education. Ivanka Trump, a White House senior adviser, reaps trademarks and promotional opportunities from China and Germany. Jared Kushner, Ms. Trump’s spouse, is a United States envoy to countries where his family has business ties. But why should anyone in the White House bother to separate business and government service when the president himself promotes everything from his Washington hotel to his private Mar-a-Lago beach club.",
		"6" : "Presiding over this ethical morass is Stefan Passantino, the White House ethics officer. Mr. Passantino is a lawyer who has represented former House Speakers Dennis Hastert and Newt Gingrich in their ethical tangles. In 2009, when the Obama administration was criticized for granting a waiver so William Lynn, a former Raytheon lobbyist, could become deputy defense secretary, Mr. Passantino seemed to take the wrong lesson about the disclosure. “Very often in Washington and in politics there are efforts to make grand pronouncements reflecting a grand change in policy,” he said. The results, he added, are “the law of good intentions running headlong into the law of unintended consequences.”",
		"7" : "It seems unlikely that good intentions have anything to do with Mr. Trump’s grand ethics pronouncements. It’s Mr. Passantino’s job to release to the ethics office, and to the public, the names of public servants whom Mr. Trump has allowed to bypass the rules. If he stonewalls, we look again to Republicans like Mr. Grassley, now chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, to remind this administration that the American people deserve an accountable government, and to make sure they get it."

It also applies to all of us trying to think about education, including her critics. And the results from Washington are important partly because they defy easy ideological conclusions.",

It is the most powerful force for accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and lifting middle-class living standards. Well-educated adults earn much more, live longer and are happier than poorly educated adults. When researchers try to tease out whether education does much to cause these benefits, the answer appears to be yes.",

On the other are so-called reformers, who believe in vouchers, charter schools and standardized tests.",
		"7" : "Unfortunately, this caricature mixes several ideas that do not necessarily go together. In particular, it conflates vouchers (coupons that let parents use their tax dollars for private schools) with charter schools (public schools that operate outside the usual bureaucracy).",
		"8" : "Hard-core reformers, like DeVos, support vouchers and charters. Hard-core traditionalists oppose both. The rest of us should distinguish between them, because their results differ.",
		"9" : "Vouchers have been disappointing. They are based on the free-market theory that parents will choose good schools over bad ones. It’s a reasonable theory, and vouchers can have benefits, like allowing children to leave dangerous schools.",
		"10" : "For the most part, though, identifying a good school is hard for parents. Conventional wisdom usually defines a good school as one attended by high-achieving students, which is easy to measure. But that’s akin to concluding that all of LeBron James’s coaches have been geniuses.",
		"11" : "Unlike most voucher programs, many charter-school systems are subject to rigorous evaluation and oversight. Local officials decide which charters can open and expand. Officials don’t get every decision right, but they are able to evaluate schools based on student progress and surveys of teachers and families.",
		"12" : "As a result, many charters have flourished, especially in places where traditional schools have struggled. This evidence comes from top academic researchers, studying a variety of places, including Washington, Boston, Denver, New Orleans, New York, Florida and Texas. The anecdotes about failed charters are real, but they’re not the norm.",
		"13" : "Douglas Harris, a Tulane professor, says the difference between charters and vouchers boils down to “managed competition” versus the “free market.” Susan Dynarski of the University of Michigan talks about charters’ successfully combining flexibility and accountability. Joshua Angrist of M.I.T. says, “Flexibility alone is not enough.”",
		"14" : "Crucially, many charters are open to all comers, which means their success doesn’t stem from skimming off the best. And the schools’ benefits extend beyond test scores to more meaningful metrics, like college graduation.",
		"15" : "The District of Columbia study highlights the charter/voucher contrast in a neat way. The voucher results look so weak — even worse than elsewhere — partly because the city’s charters are so strong. That is, voucher recipients are being compared with children at higher-performing public schools than in the past, and the voucher schools aren’t keeping up.",
		"16" : "It’s an argument for a political compromise: fewer vouchers, more charters.",
		"17" : "If you’re a progressive, I realize that this compromise may make you squeamish. Progressives often prefer to spend more on traditional schools — which are still crucial — and to trust them.",
		"18" : "But I would encourage you to look at the full evidence with an open mind. Charters have the potential to help a lot of poor children in the immediate future, and it’s hard to think of a more important progressive goal.",
		"19" : "As for Secretary DeVos, I hope she is similarly open to new facts. It seems a reasonable expectation for somebody whose title is secretary of education."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "After the British writer G. K. Chesterton visited the United States for the first time, he remarked that America was “a nation with the soul of a church.”",
		"2" : "Mr. Chesterton wasn’t referring to the nation’s religiosity but to its formation around a set of core political beliefs enshrined in founding “sacred texts,” like the Declaration of Independence. He noted that the United States, unlike European countries, did not rely on ethnic kinship, cultural character or a “national type” for a shared identity.",
		"3" : "The profoundness of the American experiment, he argued, was that it aspired to create “a home out of vagabonds and a nation out of exiles” united by voluntary assent to commonly held political beliefs.",
		"4" : "But recent survey data provides troubling evidence that a shared sense of national identity is unraveling, with two mutually exclusive narratives emerging along party lines. At the heart of this divide are opposing reactions to changing demographics and culture. The shock waves from these transformations — harnessed effectively by Donald Trump’s campaign — are reorienting the political parties from the more familiar liberal-versus-conservative alignment to new poles of cultural pluralism and monism.",
		"5" : "An Associated Press-NORC poll found nearly mirror-opposite partisan reactions to the question of what kind of culture is important for American identity. Sixty-six percent of Democrats, compared with only 35 percent of Republicans, said the mixing of cultures and values from around the world was extremely or very important to American identity. Similarly, 64 percent of Republicans, compared with 32 percent of Democrats, saw a culture grounded in Christian religious beliefs as extremely or very important.",
		"6" : "These divergent orientations can also be seen in a recent poll by P.R.R.I. that explored partisan perceptions of which groups are facing discrimination in the country. Like Americans overall, large majorities of Democrats believe minority groups such as African-Americans, immigrants, Muslims and gay and transgender people face a lot of discrimination in the country. Only about one in five Democrats say that majority groups such as Christians or whites face a lot of discrimination.",
		"7" : "Republicans, on the other hand, are much less likely than Democrats to believe any minority group faces a lot of discrimination, and they believe Christians and whites face roughly as much discrimination as immigrants, Muslims and gay and transgender people. Moreover, only 27 percent of Republicans say blacks experience a lot of discrimination, while 43 percent say whites do and 48 percent say the same of Christians.",
		"8" : "Taken as a whole, these partisan portraits highlight contrasting responses to the country’s changing demographics and culture, especially over the past decade as the country has ceased to be a majority white Christian nation — from 54 percent in 2008 to 43 percent today. Democrats — only 29 percent of whom are white and Christian — are embracing these changes as central to their vision of an evolving American identity that is strengthened and renewed by diversity. By contrast, Republicans — nearly three-quarters of whom identify as white and Christian — see these changes eroding a core white Christian American identity and perceive themselves to be under siege as the country changes around them.",
		"9" : "Americans of both political parties sense the unraveling of a broadly shared consensus of American identity, although they cite different reasons for feeling that way. About seven in 10 Republicans and Democrats fear that the United States is losing its national identity, the A.P.-NORC survey found. The two political parties may not share much, but each is increasingly aware that the other has embraced a radically different vision of America’s identity and future.",
		"10" : "These responses are shifting the political magnetic field that defines the parties. Republican leaders are finding strong support among their base for the Trump administration’s executive order barring travel to the United States from particular Muslim-majority countries. But their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was dramatically derailed by factions within their own party.",
		"11" : "Democrats, on the other hand, are enjoying energetic backing from their base for pro-immigration and pro-L.G.B.T. stances, but they are experiencing increasing opposition to their support for free trade.",
		"12" : "There have been other times in our history when the fabric of American identity was stretched in similar ways — the Civil War, heightened levels of immigration at the turn of the 20th century and the cultural upheavals of the 1960s.",
		"13" : "But during these eras, white Christians were still secure as a demographic and cultural majority in the nation. The question at stake was whether they were going to make room for new groups at a table they still owned. Typically, a group would gain its seat in exchange for assimilation to the majority culture. But as white Christians have slipped from the majority over the past decade, this familiar strategy is no longer viable.",
		"14" : "White Christians are today struggling to face a new reality: the inevitable surrender of table ownership in exchange for an equal seat. And it’s this new higher-stakes challenge that is fueling the great partisan reorientation we are witnessing today.",
		"15" : "The temptation for the Republican Party, especially with Donald Trump in the White House, is to double down on a form of white Christian nationalism, which treats racial and religious identity as tribal markers and defends a shrinking demographic with increasingly autocratic assertions of power.",
		"16" : "For its part, the Democratic Party is contending with the difficulties of organizing its more diverse coalition while facing its own tribal temptations to embrace an identity politics that has room to celebrate every group except whites who strongly identify as Christian. If this realignment continues, left out of this opposition will be a significant number of whites who are both wary of white Christian nationalism and weary of feeling discounted in the context of identity politics.",
		"17" : "This end is not inevitable, but if we are to continue to make one out of many, leaders of both parties will have to step back from the reactivity of the present and take up the more arduous task of weaving a new national narrative in which all Americans can see themselves."

		"1" : "One of the tragedies of these post-truth times is that the lies, conspiracy theories and illusions spread by social media and populist politicians can be downright dangerous. The denial of human responsibility for climate change is one obvious example; another is opposition to vaccination. A serious outbreak of measles in Italy and in some other European countries could well be the result of a drop-off in vaccinations caused by utterly misguided and discredited claims about their dangers.",
		"2" : "Vaccines are among the greatest achievements of medical science, an easily and safely administered defense against once common and often deadly diseases like measles, polio, smallpox, whooping cough and cervical cancer. Yet fear of vaccines has spread over the past two decades, fueled in part by an infamous study published in the medical journal Lancet in 1998 and later retracted and completely discredited.",
		"3" : "More recently, President Trump has added his voice to vaccine skepticism, like this utterly unfounded and irresponsible tweet: “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!” In Italy, the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) led by the comedian Beppe Grillo has campaigned actively on an anti-vaccination platform, likewise repeating the false ties between vaccinations and autism.",
		"4" : "To these and other skeptics, the measles outbreak in Italy should sound a piercing alarm. As of April 26, the Italian Ministry of Health had reported 1,739 cases of the disease, compared with 840 in all of 2016 and only 250 in 2015. Of those stricken, 88 percent had not been vaccinated. The danger was not only to them: 159 of the cases were health care workers infected by patients. Yet studies show that 97 percent of people who receive the recommended two doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are fully protected. Most people today would not remember a time when measles — or mumps, or polio — were commonplace.",
		"5" : "M5S may not be responsible for the entire outbreak, since vaccine skepticism predates the party’s rise. Yet the percentage of 2-year-olds given vaccinations has steadily fallen in recent years, from 88 percent in 2013 to 86 percent in 2014 and 85.3 percent in 2015. The World Health Organization regards 95 percent as the level to achieve “herd immunity,” at which point the disease poses no threat to the entire community.",
		"6" : "Combating vaccine skepticism is not easy, because even the countless studies by innumerable health groups affirming that there is no link between vaccines and autism have failed to penetrate the fog spread by Mr. Grillo and his ilk. The Italian measles outbreak, unfortunate as it is, does give health authorities an opportunity to strengthen their case by pointing to concrete evidence of what inevitably follows when vaccinations drop off."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — If nothing else, President Trump has already secured a place in history. It is his grasp of history that seems less secure.",
		"2" : "In his latest foray into what might be called the alternative past, Mr. Trump suggested that Andrew Jackson had been “really angry” about the Civil War, which did not break out until 16 years after his death. And for good measure, Mr. Trump questioned “why was there the Civil War” in the first place, suggesting that it should have simply been worked out.",
		"3" : "The comments, made in an interview broadcast on Monday, may have been attributable to imprecision, but for historians they underscored what seems to be a tenuous understanding by Mr. Trump of the course of events that preceded his ascension to power. At various points, he has seemed to suggest that Frederick Douglass is still alive, appeared surprised that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, and mounted a plaque at a golf course marking a Civil War battle that never happened.",
		"4" : "“Presidents should have some better sense of the nation’s history as they become part of it,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton.",
		"5" : "White House officials said that Mr. Trump was being misinterpreted and that a few random comments had been twisted into meaning something they did not. The criticism of his remarks, they said, reflects a “gotcha” game by intellectual elitists who fail to understand him.",
		"6" : "“There’s a certain amount of hunting for ‘what is it that Trump has done that’s dumb?’” said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, who taught history as a college professor in Georgia and has written multiple historical novels. “Trump’s not a student of history. Trump’s an extraordinarily successful, entrepreneurial personality who learns what he needs to know when he needs to know it. Trump is learning history as he governs.”",
		"7" : "After Mr. Trump’s comments led to criticism, he tried to clarify  Monday night on Twitter. “President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry,” he wrote. “Would never have let it happen!”",
		"8" : "Many presidents find history absorbing, since they live it and make it. President George W. Bush read 14 books about Lincoln during his time in office, seeking inspiration and comfort. President Barack Obama made a point of regularly hosting historians like Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert A. Caro, David Kennedy and Robert Dallek for dinners examining how the travails of his predecessors offered lessons for his presidency.",
		"9" : "But even presidents with more evident interest have tripped up over history from time to time. Mr. Obama mangled World War II events when he said his great-uncle helped liberate Auschwitz, which would have been possible only if his great-uncle had been a Soviet soldier. Aides later clarified that Mr. Obama meant Buchenwald, which was liberated by American troops. Similarly, when Mr. Obama referred to “Polish death camps,” he generated a storm of protest in Warsaw, which always insists that they be referred to as German death camps on Polish territory.",
		"10" : "Mr. Trump has made questionable comments a regular feature of his public discourse, going back years. During the campaign, he talked about thousands of Muslims in the United States cheering after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, despite a lack of evidence. At a golf course in Virginia, he posted a plaque honoring the “River of Blood” where so many soldiers died in the Civil War that “the water would turn red,” even though historians said no such battle took place there.",
		"11" : "At an African-American History Month celebration in February, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that the 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass was still around. “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,” he said.",
		"12" : "At a later fund-raiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee, he seemed surprised that Lincoln belonged to the Republican Party. “Great president,” he said. “Most people don’t even know he was a Republican, right? Does anyone know? Lot of people don’t know that.”",
		"13" : "No doubt many Americans are not fully aware of the country’s history, but most do know Lincoln was a Republican, according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012. Fifty-five percent of those polled correctly said Lincoln was a Republican. Still, perhaps Mr. Trump was thinking about the 28 percent who thought the Great Emancipator was a Democrat.",
		"14" : "Even his staff has found trouble over historically loose comments. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, asserted at a briefing that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people. Mr. Spicer quickly apologized.",
		"15" : "“Trump seems almost uniquely ill equipped to process history, whether because of his lack of empathy, his allergy to complexity, or his tendency to keep distant from anything that might carry the whiff of defeat,” said Paul Starobin, author of the newly released “Madness Rules the Hour,” about the confrontation at Charleston, S.C., that led to the Civil War. “History is not tidy. Trump likes tidy. He likes slogans. History doesn’t offer any.”",
		"16" : "The latest historical question mark came in an interview Mr. Trump gave to The Washington Examiner in which he discussed Andrew Jackson. Mr. Trump has embraced Jackson as a kindred populist spirit railing against the establishment ever since Mr. Gingrich and Stephen K. Bannon, now the president’s chief strategist, told him of the similarities last year. Mr. Trump has hung a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office and visited his estate in Tennessee.",
		"17" : "“I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn’t have had the Civil War,” he told The Examiner. “He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War; he said, ‘There’s no reason for this.’”",
		"18" : "Mr. Trump added: “People don’t realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don’t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?”",
		"19" : "While he demonstrated knowledge of other details of Jackson’s life, the Civil War comments set off a wave of scorn online. “POTUS says that Andrew Jackson (who died in 1845) ‘was really angry’ about the Civil War,” Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate last year, wrote on Twitter, using the initials for president of the United States. “Paging the Department of Education …”",
		"20" : "John Weaver, a longtime adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other politicians, mocked Mr. Trump with a reference to a supposed terrorist attack in Kentucky that one of his aides once cited erroneously. “Too bad Pres. Jackson didn’t ride up to Bowling Green/sit down with Frederick Douglass at besieged Nordstroms & figure out Civil War thingy,” Mr. Weaver wrote.",
		"21" : "Jackson, a slave owner who believed in the use of force if necessary to preserve the Union, did not live to see the Civil War, but Mr. Trump may have been thinking of the Nullification Crisis of 1832-33, when Jackson threatened to send troops after South Carolina declared tariffs imposed by the federal government null and void and threatened to secede. That was a precursor, in a sense, to the crisis that precipitated the Civil War in 1861.",
		"22" : "“That’s similar in vein to what one would say about the Civil War,” said Michael Dubke, the White House communications director. “I’m sure something along those lines is what the president was referring to.”",
		"23" : "Mr. Gingrich suggested that Mr. Trump was onto something in suggesting that Jackson would have been more suited to stopping the slide to war than James Buchanan, who was passive as Southern states seceded. “Compare Jackson with Buchanan, and you could make a pretty good argument that had Jackson been president in 1856, there wouldn’t have been a Civil War because he would have crushed it,” Mr. Gingrich said.",
		"24" : "Jon Meacham, a Jackson biographer, agreed that Mr. Trump probably meant the Nullification Crisis, but he said the question on what caused the Civil War suggested that Mr. Trump might have been referring to a deal to avert conflict short of the abolition of slavery. “The expansion of slavery caused the Civil War,” he said. “And you can’t get around that. So what does Trump mean? Would he have let slavery exist but not expand? That’s the counterfactual question you have to ask.”"

One of the judges was be Jody Quon, the photography director of New York magazine.

		"1" : "PHILADELPHIA — Deshaun Watson, the Clemson University quarterback drafted by the Houston Texans, dared to wear spiky Christian Louboutin Dandy Pik Pik shoes, which sell for $1,995, to go with a crisp tuxedo suit from J. C. Penney’s Collection by Michael Strahan.",
		"2" : "Derek Barnett, a University of Tennessee defensive end taken by the Philadelphia Eagles, wore a three-piece ensemble in a mellow shade of red.",
		"3" : "And Takkarist McKinley, a University of California, Los Angeles, defensive end selected by the Washington Redskins, rocked a blue suit with a window check pattern at the opening night of the National Football League draft on Thursday.",
		"4" : "But Garett Bolles, the University of Utah offensive tackle who was chosen by the Denver Broncos, was the fashion star of the night. And it wasn’t because of the gray suit he wore (also from the Strahan line). Mr. Bolles stole the show by having the night’s best escort: his baby son, Kingston, who was also dressed in a suit of gray. This giant of a man carried the infant in the crook of his arm, like a football.",
		"5" : "Like everyone else who strode down the red carpet here, Mr. Bolles is a large man, but he was almost lost in the teeming crowd. Like our expanding universe, the N.F.L. pursues a single course — more and bigger. And the draft has become part of the general bloat.",
		"6" : "Once presented on ESPN as a Saturday and Sunday afternoon package, the annual selection of college football’s top players was then a sleepy event followed mainly by sports die-hards who quoted Chris Berman. Starting in 2010, the draft expanded from two days to three and was moved to prime time. Now the league has craftily turned it into a junior Super Bowl in its spectacle — and a fashion show, too.",
		"7" : "The draft is the moment when players go from the college level — with its prohibitions against receiving gifts or financial compensation and its discouragement of off-field flash — to the world of red-carpet paparazzi and endorsement deals. Even if they are not among the top five picks, members of the Class of 2017 can still audition to become the face of Under Armour when Tom Brady retires.",
		"8" : "This year, in its quest for bigness and moreness, the N.F.L. took over the city of Philadelphia.",
		"9" : "Something called the N.F.L. Draft Theater was constructed on the red-carpeted steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The stage had three tiers and held more than 3,000 people. Its foam-columned facade replicated that of the museum’s, as if to confirm that football is America’s high culture. Eric Finkelstein, the league’s director of event operations, called the temporary structure “an engineering marvel.”",
		"10" : "Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the wide, tree-lined avenue that leads to the museum, was turned into the site of a giant street festival that was expected to attract 200,000 visitors over the draft’s three days.",
		"11" : "A few hours before the first-round picks were to be announced, there was a line 100 deep to enter the tented N.F.L. store selling team merchandise. The most popular fashion accessory spotted on the grounds was a Philadelphia Eagles jersey, in white or green. The city had taken its hosting role seriously.",
		"12" : "On Tuesday and Wednesday — N.F.L. Draft Eve, as the sports radio talkers here took to calling it — a room in the Westin Hotel in Center City was transformed into the eighth annual N.F.L. Pre-Draft Experiential Gifting and Style Suite.",
		"13" : "“This is all new, to be able to receive things without repercussions,” said Jayon Brown, who was one of more than 20 prospects who dropped by.",
		"14" : "A linebacker from U.C.L.A. with blond braids and a magnetic smile, Mr. Brown was given a test spin in the iRobotics 7 medical massage chair and handed clothes to try on from a new brand called Reinge. He was also supplied with free samples of the nutritional supplement Performix and given a jacket and knapsack from the streetwear label Triple Five Soul. Representatives from Sean John asked him to have his photo taken wearing a black ball cap bearing a white-lettered phrase: “Dream Big.”",
		"15" : "By the time the draft began, Mr. Brown and his swag were far from Philadelphia. Expected to be a later-round pick, he flew home to Long Beach, Calif., to watch it all on television. As at Oscar night, the red carpet was the domain of marquee stars.",
		"16" : "The first player to be announced, Michael Buffer-style, and descend the stone steps was Leonard Fournette. The running back from Louisiana State, who was chosen in the first round by the Jacksonville Jaguars, kept it simple in a dark blue suit and red tie, letting his fearsome-looking under-beard do the signifying. Most of his fellow players followed his example, wearing standard suits of blue, black or gray whose main appeal was simply that they fit. Sort of.",
		"17" : "Still, there were plenty of players willing to stand out. The Western Michigan University wide receiver Corey Davis, taken by the Tennessee Titans as the fifth pick over all, wore a blazer whose pinkish-peach shade was so distinct, its Pantone name eluded him.",
		"18" : "“I don’t even know,” he said when asked the color. “It’s exclusive.”",
		"19" : "Malik McDowell, a Michigan State University defensive tackle, was another prospect who dared to be distinct, wearing a black and silver blazer that shimmered in the light. The jacket was custom made for him by “a stylist named Christine,” he said, adding, “I told her I wanted something that was black, and popped.”",
		"20" : "There was plenty of down time on the red carpet, as the players and their families mingled with the reporters, who, along with their camera operators, were stacked five deep. A regal man sat in the bleachers, his Vandyke beard dyed Indianapolis Colts blue.",
		"21" : "Among the primping TV reporters was Jacques Doucet, the sports anchor on the scene for WAFB, a CBS affiliate in Baton Rouge, La. He patted his hair in preparation and straightened his lavender shirt, which he had paired with a purple tie a shade darker.",
		"22" : "“Bought that today,” Mr. Doucet said of the tie-shirt combo. “Here in Philadelphia, at Century 21. Which I thought only sold real estate.”",
		"23" : "The most stylish reporter turned out to be a moonlighting player in disguise — Rodney McLeod, a safety for the hometown Eagles. Mr. McLeod went undrafted in 2012 before making it to the N.F.L., so this was his first draft experience, he said. In his Common Projects sneakers, Ventresca checked blazer and wide-brimmed hat with a feather, was he dressed to make a statement?",
		"24" : "“I always dress this snazzy,” Mr. McLeod said. “But you got to do a little bit extra today.”",
		"25" : "Indeed, as the names were announced, you were reminded that, for the players and their families, this was a one-time event, a golden moment of potential before an N.F.L. career that could go any number of ways."

		"1" : "When George Oommen was 16 years old, he inherited a two-story house on a river in Mepral, a village in the verdant southern Indian state of Kerala, where his father had grown up.",
		"2" : "By tradition, the house was always passed to the youngest son, which he was. But it wasn’t a house he needed or wanted. He was a teenager, living with his family in Delhi. After college, he moved to the United States to study at Harvard, where he worked for three decades as an architect. Ten years ago, he became a full-time abstract painter.",
		"3" : "But the house meant something to him and his family. More than four generations had used the 300-year-old structure, built high above rice paddies in the river’s flood plain. But as family members went abroad or died, the house, named Meda, sat empty and went into decline.",
		"4" : "Its foundation and lower floor were made of porous whitewashed laterite stone blocks that during monsoon floods sank a little farther into the soft ground; perched upstairs, the ancient structure of Anjili hardwood was joined, as in Japanese temples, without any nails. Its peaked roof made of clay tiles from Mangalore effectively kept out storms. Over the years, Meda’s three rooms and two wide verandas on the north and south sides sheltered the family members, who grew rice.",
		"5" : "“I still had an emotional connection to this building and was thinking of renovating it,” Mr. Oommen said. “But, even if I had raised it again, the land was unstable and no one in our extended family was willing to return to that remote location.”",
		"6" : "Mr. Oommen, 75, still travels to India, which inspires his painting, but he does not go to the house. Rather, he goes to an island called Mankotta that still has the unspoiled air of the time when he lived in Kerala as a boy amid landscapes devoid of modern roads and shopping malls.",
		"7" : "About seven years ago, Mr. Oommen decided he had to sell the house because his children did not want it. But potential buyers were interested only in the land, so they would have dismantled and sold Meda as well-seasoned timber and artifacts for tourists.",
		"8" : "He did not want that to happen. Fortunately, a friend, Pradeep Sachdeva, 59, heard about his predicament and agreed to buy the 2,000-square-foot house and move it piece by piece to his own 3½-acre farm in Sadhrana village, south of Delhi, where he lives.",
		"9" : "Mr. Sachdeva, an architect, saw a future for Meda as a guesthouse at his weekend house. He is known in India for his interiors at resorts like the Samode Palace in Rajasthan, and in Delhi for the large urban renewal projects such as the Dilli Haat market and the 20-acre Garden of Five Senses.",
		"10" : "Mr. Oommen was overjoyed. “I never thought of taking it apart and putting it in another location,” he said.",
		"11" : "But villagers who rarely ventured 100 miles outside Mepral did not want to see it go 1,500 miles away. “In that secluded area, which is largely below sea level, people historically went to Meda seeking refuge during floods,” Mr. Oommen said. But it was either move it or destroy it. “Their important icon would have been entirely lost if we had not moved it,” he said. “I feel I saved a piece of my family.”",
		"12" : "For the move in late 2010, a speaker of Malayalam (Kerala’s main language) on the staff of Mr. Sachdeva’s firm recruited Narayan Achari, one of the last Mepral carpenters skilled in building traditional Kerala wood houses. Together with a small team, they dismantled, numbered and documented Meda’s individual components. As a last nod to tradition, before the parts were loaded onto northbound trucks, they sought blessings at the local snake temple for safe passage.",
		"13" : "In the spring of 2011, Mr. Achari and his assistants put the house back together at Mr. Sachdeva’s farm on a new ground floor with walls of plastered brick.",
		"14" : "“The joinery was so simple and sophisticated that within six weeks Meda was reassembled,” Mr. Sachdeva said. “It looked better than ever and good for another hundred years.”",
		"15" : "A modern bathroom and kitchen are both cordoned off by partition walls from the otherwise open-plan ground floor. “I really wanted a columnless space for this adaptive reuse of the building as a functioning, contemporary home,” Mr. Sachdeva said. “If I did not make it usable, it would gather cobwebs. Now, friends come and stay, and occasionally I use it, too.”",
		"16" : "He also turned to some of his friends to help reimagine the house. The British designer John Bowman, who lives and works in Rajokri — between New Delhi (one of Delhi’s districts) and Gurgaon — created a cast-iron spiral staircase and brass railing leading to the top floor. It replaced a dilapidated exterior wood staircase whose treads were repurposed as a dining table and shelving. In a bathroom added upstairs, Mr. Bowman fashioned a dull-brass sink etched with a leaf pattern and a cast-brass circular shower pan, echoing the building’s handmade aesthetic and its natural surroundings.",
		"17" : "Upstairs, “we tried to conserve nearly everything as it was, although we did add electricity and plumbing,” Mr. Sachdeva said. Ventilation openings in the gable ends of the building, similar to those seen in traditional Kerala architecture, and a few replacement roof tiles are also new.",
		"18" : "The guesthouse, oriented north-south as it always was, is in a garden now. “It seems to belong there, even though the environment is completely different culturally and climatically,” said Mr. Sachdeva, who is also a landscape architect and a co-author of “A Naturalist’s Guide to Trees & Shrubs of India.”",
		"19" : "“I know trees,” he said. He took great care not to harm any while relocating Meda, and never worried about Meda’s old wood faring poorly in this much drier, foreign place.",
		"20" : "“I think it is very old and like steel,” he said with conviction. “Nothing will happen to it now.”"

	"date" : "2017-05-03",
	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/style/when-the-gospel-of-minimalism-collides-with-daily-life.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "Minimalism as a lifestyle creed is pretty simple: The less you own, the happier you’ll be. Pare down and declutter, the thinking goes, and your mind will have room to exhale. Minimalists say that it’s about spending more energy on living, less energy on having. With more than six million Instagram posts tagged #minimalism, and four million more tagged #minimalist, it’s a trend that won’t die.",
		"2" : "And understandably so. The impulse to step off the consumer treadmill can be quite tempting.",
		"3" : "In theory, minimalists have more time and money to amass something that researchers have found to provide far more satisfaction than material items: memories. Experiential purchases, psychologists assure us, offer deeper emotional sustenance than any new gadget or piece of furniture. Studies suggest that even the perfect Danish modern chair fades into the background after daily exposure. Yet our brains never quite get over the thrill of, say, hiking Bryce Canyon, which yields more psychological bang for the buck.",
		"4" : "But those who have tried the minimalist way have found that it’s not always as satisfying as design websites and tiny-house blogs insist. For some people, purging did not bring Shangri-La. Like most things, living minimally is more complicated than it may seem. In fact, some people found that their compact homes and minimalist manifestoes came with different challenges, and that the trade-offs were not always worth it. Sometimes, they realized, a little more stuff actually brought them immense comfort.",
		"5" : "For Karen Bertelsen, a former television host in Canada and now a lifestyle blogger, minimalism was calming — until it became boring. Her desire to pare down began in 2009, when she suddenly felt that her two-bedroom brick cottage in Ontario looked stuffed to the gills with antiques and lace. “One day,” she said, “it just started to feel oppressive.”",
		"6" : "She recalls how, inspired by the virtuously clean-looking homes she saw pictured in Dwell magazine, she thought: “This is it. I am a minimalist. This is how it’s going to be, everything calm from now on.” And within two weeks, she had gotten rid of almost everything she owned and painted the whole place Decorator’s White, a life reboot. She went full-on Dwell, even building a chicken coop, the de rigueur symbol of suburban simplicity, in the backyard. A year after what she calls “the incident,” she wrote her first post on her blog, The Art of Doing Stuff, about the day she realized that she just “hated every inch of her house” — and how she came to view white as “the Botox of paint colors”: She and her home “look younger and fresher for it.”",
		"7" : "But fairly quickly, Ms. Bertelsen fell off the wagon, sneaking items here and there — a pair of flea market midcentury lamps, an Empire chandelier — back to her 1,200-square-foot home. Even more, her venture into minimalism made her realize how much she enjoyed viewing the physical manifestations of memories, reliving moments through concrete reminders. “I want to see the drumsticks from the last Ramones show I went to in 1994, or the rock I picked up climbing a mountain in Vancouver,” she said. “I want to see the titles of all the books I’ve read.”",
		"8" : "“Minimalism sure does suck you in,” she said. “Life looks easier. It seems like your skin will be dewier and your hair shinier — a happier, healthier version of yourself.” Today, Ms. Bertelsen believes that she’s struck the perfect balance, living in a well-edited space with expressive touches, like the stand, built by a friend, in her dining room that displays one of her riding saddles, a memento from a sport she loved as a child and young adult. But she also kept her backyard chickens from her Dwell phase and maintains that she’ll always be a little bit of a minimalist type inside, too.",
		"9" : "According to the sociologist Joel Stillerman, author of “The Sociology of Consumption,” among certain educated, upper-middle-class segments of the United States and other Western societies, there is a connection between minimalist design and a quest for well-being. But minimalism is also meant to project taste, refinement and aesthetic knowledge. “These people,” he said, “are making the statement that ‘I can afford to have less. I appreciate books and travel and good meals.’”",
		"10" : "Mr. Stillerman calls these post-materialist values; in other words, simplicity as a form of cultural capital. This concept is evident in a current exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, “Sara Berman’s Closet”: an actual closet, meticulously organized and filled with white garments, recreated by the artists Maira and Alex Kalman, Ms. Berman’s daughter and grandson. The installation, according to the museum, represents Ms. Berman’s life from 1982 to 2004, when she lived in a sparsely but precisely decorated Greenwich Village studio after divorcing her husband of 38 years. The closet epitomizes the idea of the city sophisticate that draws so many people to minimally designed spaces.",
		"11" : "Still, critics chide minimalists for a kind of faux self-discipline. After all, if you can afford to toss your stuff, you can probably reacquire it should you change your mind and, say, come to find that your home carbonation system is indispensable. And living minimally isn’t an entirely new thing. Tiny houses are in vogue, but not mobile homes, which have been around a while. As Dak Kopec, an environmental psychologist at the Boston Architectural College explained, it’s “more prestigious to say you live in a tiny home than a recreational vehicle or camper.”",
		"12" : "But there are also potential health problems associated with tiny living spaces. Most notable, some studies have linked crowding-related stress to increased rates of domestic violence and substance abuse; experts worry in particular about the growing trend of micro-apartments in urban centers. To combat New York’s housing shortage, for example, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration held a competition to design the city’s first affordable residential tower of micro-units — single apartments of 260 to 360 square feet — which opened in 2016. While everyone’s tolerance level for small spaces is different — there’s no agreed-upon formula for square-footage-to-person ratio, Dr. Kopec said — each of us can handle only so much crowding in our intimate quarters before it takes a toll. At least in a tiny house or an R.V., as opposed to a micro-apartment, people can retreat outdoors for privacy.",
		"13" : "Finding the appropriate psychological balance between indoor and outdoor space is also more art than science, and it may take a bit of design trial and error to get it right. Some of us create enough internal stimulation that we crave a minimal home, explained Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He describes how we all modulate our outside environment and our private spaces: Someone who lives on a farm, for example, may want to pump up a home’s visual volume, whereas a person living in Manhattan may find that a tchotchke-free home with a white palette helps to create a feeling of equilibrium.",
		"14" : "Kerri Fivecoat-Campbell is candid about the pros and cons of tiny homes and a minimalist ethos. Her book, “Living Large in Our Little House,” details life with her husband and their six dogs in a 480-square-foot cabin in the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas. “When we first moved here full time, I tried to write in our 10-by-10 bedroom, but it was like working from an airplane seat,” she said. Then it hit her: People go to offices. Her husband worked outside their home. Why couldn’t she build a free-standing structure on their property for her books and desk? “I realized it’s not cheating on tiny houses or minimalism if I build a little 320-foot detached writing studio,” she said. “You have to make this lifestyle work for you.”",
		"15" : "Like Ms. Bertelsen, she found that her need to preserve childhood memories proved more powerful than she could have predicted. “The only time I’ve ever really wanted more space and felt sadness over it,” she said, “is when I couldn’t fit my mom’s wedding china in our house after she died.” The china cabinet was far too large, and there was no way to store its contents in their home. The desire to hold on to certain objects as a tangible connection to a lost loved one is another reason she’s thankful for her separate office space; there, she displays many of her mother’s books.",
		"16" : "Over time, minimalists may also find that they lack the time and energy needed to constantly prune their homes and exist as sparingly as possible. After Hattie Garlick lost her job in late 2012, she and her husband, Tom, declared a spending freeze on all “kiddie consumerism” for the year 2013, vowing to buy nothing — no toys, clothing, activities or child-targeted foods — for their toddler and, later, for the baby girl they learned they were expecting. Ms. Garlick started a blog to chronicle her minimalist journey, showing how she found used baby gear and swapped items with friends. The internet named her the Minimalist Mom and the experience inspired her second book, “Born to Be Wild,” which offers instructions for free outdoor activities that engage a child’s imagination. Now, four years after her Minimalist Mom sojourn, she works three days a week as a freelance writer, with no pressing need to pinch pennies. But most important, she said, she feels “less addicted to spending,” so she’s less panicked about a leaner month or the prospect of any future instability.",
		"17" : "These days, she warned, their two-story London house is far from minimalist. “Lego bricks strewn across the floor, poster paints cluttering the breakfast table, children’s drawings covering the fridge,” she said. In hindsight, she said, some of the trade-offs she made as the Minimalist Mom, like spending days looking for free toilet-training underpants for her toddler, “may not have been the best investment of my time.”",
		"18" : "Ms. Garlick cautions those flirting with such a lifestyle change, “Chasing any ideal, whether it’s minimalism or anything else, isn’t the way forward.”",
		"19" : "“Family life,” she added, “and actually any life probably, is at its best when it’s a bit scruffy and messy.” Being the Minimalist Mom entailed some daily mental gymnastics, she said, and required her to say no to her son about buying certain things, purely “in pursuit of a principle.” Today, she said, she feels more relaxed and happier, without the added worry of so much minimalism."

		"1" : "Thomas Rainer and I have both been doing the botanical thing for decades; we know, and use, many of the same plants — and even much of the same horticultural vocabulary. But what he and I see when we look at a butterfly weed or a coneflower, or what we mean when we say familiar words like “layering” or “ground cover,” is surprisingly not synonymous.",
		"2" : "It turns out I’ve been missing what the plants were trying to tell me, failing to read botanical body language and behavior that could help me put plants together in combinations that would solve challenges that many of us have: beds that aren’t quite working visually, and garden areas that don’t function without lots of maintenance.",
		"3" : "As we gardeners shop the catalogs or the just-opening local garden centers with an eye to finally “fixing” that bed out front that has never quite cooperated, I asked Mr. Rainer, a landscape architect based in Washington, D.C., to lend us his 3-D vision.",
		"4" : "In his career, Mr. Rainer has designed landscapes for the United States Capitol grounds, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the New York Botanical Garden, as well as gardens from Maine to Florida. He is an author with Claudia West of the 2015 book “Planting in a Post-Wild World: Designing Plant Communities for Resilient Landscapes.” He is a principal in the firm Rhodeside & Harwell, but will leave soon to start a new firm with his wife, the landscape architect Melissa Rainer, and Ms. West. He advocates an ecologically expressive aesthetic that interprets rather than imitates nature.",
		"5" : "Q. You visit a lot of gardens, and probably hear from gardeners like me with beds that just aren’t working. What’s the most common cause?",
		"6" : "A. First, we have to understand that plants are social creatures. Our garden plants evolved as members of diverse social networks. Take a butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa, named this year’s Perennial Plant of the Year by the industry group the Perennial Plant Association), for example. The height of its flower is exactly the height of the grasses it grows among. Its narrow leaves hug its stems to efficiently emerge through a crowded mix. It has a taproot that drills through the fibrous roots of grasses. Everything about that plant is a reaction to its social network. And it is these social networks that make plantings so resilient.",
		"7" : "So if we think about the way plants grow in the wild, it helps us understand how different our gardens are. In the wild, every square inch of soil is covered with a mosaic of interlocking plants, but in our gardens, we arrange plants as individual objects in a sea of mulch. We place them in solitary confinement.",
		"8" : "So if you want to add butterfly weed to your garden, you might drift it in beds several feet apart and tuck some low grasses in as companions, like prairie dropseed, blue grama grass or buffalo grass.",
		"9" : "Start by looking for bare soil. It is everywhere in our gardens and landscapes. Even in beds with shrubs in them, there are often large expanses of bare soil underneath. It’s incredibly high-maintenance. It requires multiple applications of bark mulch a year, pre-emergent herbicides and lots and lots of weeding.",
		"10" : "The alternative to mulch is green mulch — that is, plants. This includes a wide range of herbaceous plants that cover soil, like clump-forming sedges, rhizomatous strawberries or golden groundsel, and self-seeding columbine or woodland poppies.",
		"11" : "Q. If I want to try to do it more as nature does, what am I aiming for? Where do I take my cues?",
		"12" : "A. The big shift in horticulture in the next decade will be a shift from thinking about plants as individual objects to communities of interrelated species. We think it’s possible to create designed plant communities: stylized versions of naturally occurring ones, adapted to work in our gardens and landscapes. This is not ecological restoration, it’s a hybrid of ecology and horticulture. We take inspiration from the layered structure in the wild, but combine it with the legibility and design of horticulture. It is the best of both worlds: the functionality and biodiversity of an ecological approach, but also the focus on beauty, order and color that horticulture has given us. It’s possible to balance diversity with legibility, ecology with aesthetics.",
		"13" : "And it is a shift in how we take care of our gardens: a focus on management, not maintenance. When you plant in communities, you manage the entire plantings, not each individual plant. This is a pretty radical shift. It’s O.K. if a plant self-seeds around a bit, or if one plant becomes more dominant. As long as it fits the aesthetic and functional goals. We can do much less and get more.",
		"14" : "Q. Sort of gives new meaning to the phrase “community garden,” doesn’t it?",
		"15" : "A. Yes. And plants each also have particular behavior — whether it wants to hang out with other plants of its own species or not. So many gardening mistakes are a result of not paying attention to this.",
		"16" : "Q. You make them sound like social animals, which makes me think I’ve been shallow, objectifying plants — choosing among them for just another pretty face, instead of reading their body language to get at their true nature.",
		"17" : "A. One of the most useful ideas that came out of our research was this German idea of sociability, developed by Richard Hansen and Friedrich Stahl. They rank a plant’s predilection to spread on a scale of 1 to 5. A low-sociability plant is one that in the wild is almost always found by itself (Panicum virgatum, for example, is almost always found by itself in a meadow). A high-sociability plant is one that spreads into large colonies (Epimedium or Tiarella cordifolia are Level 4 plants; Carex pensylvanica and Packera aurea are Level 5). You arrange plants according to their sociability level: Plants of lower levels (1 and 2) are set individually or in small clusters. Plants of higher levels (3 to 5) are set in groups of 10 to 20-plus, arranged loosely around the others.",
		"18" : "It sounds geeky, ranking plants on a scale, but it’s useful because it informs which you should mass, and which you should mingle. It’s why a mass of 50 echinacea (Level 2) tends to flop. They’re just not meant to cover ground. But if you scatter a handful of echinacea in a mass of prairie dropseed or sideoats grama, it will look great.",
		"19" : "For years, I would pack together large grasses like switchgrass, or flowers like garden phlox (both Level 1 plants) and wonder why they got rust or powdery mildew. But if you find phlox in the wild, it will never have mildew. It’s growing out of a lot of lower plants, so it gets good air circulation. This idea changed the way I look at plants and pay attention to how they behave.",
		"20" : "Q. I know that nature doesn’t plop a 50-foot tree in a mowed lawn (or mow its lawn at all, actually), so that’s not the winning design tactic. I also know that more diverse layered designs are richer ecologically — and now you are saying they are easier to manage, too. But how do I figure out how to fit the right plants together?",
		"21" : "A. We need to start thinking about how, not what. So many garden books focus on what to plant, but so few focus on how to arrange plants to fit together in ecological combinations. When we fit our plants together like a tight jigsaw puzzle, the maintenance goes way, way down. They start becoming resilient systems rather than random objects.",
		"22" : "To do this, we need to pay attention to a plant’s shape. Its shape is often an indication of where it grows in the vertical strata of a plant community. Upright plants with low or minimal basal foliage like Joe Pye weed (Eutrochium) or spiky upright plants like beargrass (Nolina bigelovii) have adapted to growing through other plants. Horizontally spreading rhizomatous plants like Pennsylvania sedge (Carex pensylvanica) or beach strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis) have adapted to grow underneath others. You almost have to look at a plant from the vantage point of a chipmunk to see its shape.",
		"23" : "What I love about this layering idea is that it gives gardeners flexibility. Those lower layers should be very biodiverse: lots of different plants covering the ground and providing stability. But diversity in this layer does not really look messy, because most of these plants are growing underneath our taller ones, so you don’t really see them.",
		"24" : "In my garden, I have a corner with dry shade where I have a handful of shrubs that screens a busy road. Lately I’ve been adding white wood aster (Eurybia divaricata), Appalachian barren strawberry (Geum fragarioides) and Pennsylvania sedge and watching them fill the gaps. Upper layers, on the other hand, are the ones I consider the “design” layers because they shape your impression of the planting. You can arrange them naturalistically, or in neat clumps — whatever style you like. That’s the flexibility: The order and legibility of the upper layers combines with the diversity and functionality of the lower ones.",
		"25" : "The really cool thing is you can combine this layering idea with the sociability idea. Those Level 1 and 2 sociability plants tend to be those taller upright plants you use in the top layers of your garden because they like to grow through others. The Level 3 to 5 plants tend to be your lower spreading ground-hugging species.",
		"26" : "Q. So I am not shopping for plants solely as decorative objects, but for plants with a purpose — for instance, as a living mulch or a good companion to others. Of course none of that, neither the “sociability” nor the plant’s layer, is on the plant labels. A tag might say  “for containers or landscapes” or that the plant is “trailing” or “upright” or “mounding,” but that’s about it. What should the label say to help me put plants together successfully?",
		"27" : "A. My dream label would describe things that are actually useful to understanding how it grows. It would describe its shape, its root system (taprooted, deep fibrous roots, shallow horizontal roots); its life span (a short-lived pioneer like columbine, or a long-lasting lavender); its sociability level; its adaptation to stress (quick-establishing, but short-lived ruderal species like Gaura lindheimeri or Nassella tenuissima; a thuggish, fast-spreading competitor like Monarda didyma; or a slow but steady stress-tolerator like Hosta or Calamintha). These are really the factors that explain how it will grow in our gardens.",
		"28" : "Q. Where can we learn more? Being Northeastern, I love studying plants on the Go Botany plant finder from the New England Wildflower Society, for instance.",
		"29" : "A. The Mt. Cuba Center, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center and the California Native Plant Society websites all have excellent information about how a plant grows in the wild and what it grows with. But mostly, I think gardeners can get to know their plants by going outside and getting reacquainted. Take a look at their shape, how they spread and see what they are trying to show you. You can learn a lot."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LOS ANGELES — On the night the director Lee Daniels offered Gabourey Sidibe the lead in “Precious,” the role that would earn her an Oscar nomination, Mr. Daniels asked if she had a boyfriend. Ms. Sidibe, then a 24-year-old psychology major whose training as an actor had been confined to her work as a phone-sex operator, as well as roles in college productions of “Peter Pan” and “The Wiz,” answered tartly.",
		"2" : "“No,” Ms. Sidibe told him, “but now that I’m going to be a movie star, I’m going to get pregnant by a basketball player and lock down that child support.” Mr. Daniels cracked up, and the deal was sealed.",
		"3" : "“Sarcasm is my birth defect,” Ms. Sidibe, now 33, said recently. “I was born cynical.”",
		"4" : "Like many smart young women whose precociousness put them at odds with their peers — by fourth grade, Ms. Sidibe said, she was an entrenched outlier — sarcasm has been both weapon and armor. She deployed it to fine effect in her upside-down household in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she and her older brother were raised by their warm, Southern mother and stern African father, whose family traditions extended to polygamy — “I know!” Ms. Sidibe said — and who called his firstborn daughter “fatso,” as did her relatives, while outlining her future as a good Muslim wife.",
		"5" : "Her sarcasm is on rueful display in her new memoir, “This Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), in which she writes of trying to please a father for whom she is too American, too vivid and altogether too much. Her parents married when her father, who trained as an architect and worked as a taxi driver, offered to pay her mother to marry him so that he could apply for a green card. A year later, she fell in love with her paper husband. “That’s right!” Ms. Sidibe writes. “My mother is so classy that you have to marry her and then wait a year before she gives you any play.”",
		"6" : "She writes of her panic when they divorced, and her mother gave up her teaching career to become a subway singer, at the same time that the family of three moved into a single room of her aunt’s Harlem townhouse. (They would later move to a studio apartment nearby, where all three shared a bunk bed.)",
		"7" : "Ms. Sidibe’s aunt is Dorothy Pitman Hughes, a founder of Ms. Magazine; a famous portrait from 1971, of Ms. Pitman Hughes and Gloria Steinem raising their fists in a Black Power salute, hung in her sitting room, where Ms. Sidibe passed it every day on her way to school, and Ms. Steinem was a regular guest. While Ms. Sidibe averred that she is “a link on a chain of powerful women,” her own steely self-confidence, she said, wasn’t nurtured by her activist relatives so much as a survival skill she taught herself in the bruising theater of elementary school.",
		"8" : "“Children are horrible,” she said. “I was horrible.”",
		"9" : "Ms. Sidibe and I were holed up in a basement reading room at the Museum of Contemporary Art after touring the Kerry James Marshall exhibit upstairs. She wore a ruffled, daffodil-yellow dress and, for our interview, a pair of glasses. Last May, Ms. Sidibe bought a house in this city, a three-bedroom painted inside with bold colors and accessorized by African prints, surrounded by a white picket fence and climbing roses. But she had suggested the museum instead as a meeting place. Mr. Marshall’s exuberant paintings of black American life come with a manifesto she feels more strongly than ever, given the political climate. “I’m really starting to regret voting for Trump,” she said, poker-faced, and then snorted with laughter. Later she said, “Even though I’ve been black and proud my whole life, now I want to be draped in my culture; I want to be draped in my blackness.”",
		"10" : "She also wants to be swathed in privacy. Just after “Precious” made her famous, when a crew from a magazine showed up at the West End apartment where she was living at the time, drawing a crowd of onlookers, Ms. Sidibe had a full-blown panic attack. “I was an anxious kid, and now I’m an anxious adult,” she said. “I had to shut it down.” (In her book, she writes of her deep wariness of strangers. “When are you leaving?” she would ask her parents’ guests the moment they arrived. It was particularly trying for her when Ms. Sidibe’s father ensconced his female “cousin” in her bedroom and bed for months; it wasn’t until much later that she realized the woman was her father’s second wife, as in the woman he had married back home in Senegal while still married to Ms. Sidibe’s mother.)",
		"11" : "Ms. Sidibe was working at the phone-sex company and had just started Mercy College in Manhattan, her second college stint, when a friend told her about a casting call for “Precious.” She showed up almost as an afterthought, though five years earlier she had read “Push,” the novel by Sapphire, from which the movie was adapted, when a casting agent had wanted to cast Ms. Sidibe’s mother as the monstrous onscreen mother who would eventually be played by Mo’Nique. To Mr. Daniels, the harrowing role of Precious, an obese and illiterate teenager who had been sexually abused by her father and was drawn partly from the author’s real-life experience, had seemed out of reach for most Hollywood actresses.",
		"12" : "So he created a “Precious” boot camp, casting young women with no training, many of whom were the victims of abuse and the foster care system. But none worked out, he said, “and the search was mad on, and the clock was ticking.”",
		"13" : "Ms. Sidibe’s audition “was exquisite,” Mr. Daniels said.",
		"14" : "“Gabby tapped her life experience in a way that was beautiful and wasn’t tragic,” he continued. “She came in as an actor, though she was unaware of her instrument and her ability.”",
		"15" : "Yet Ms. Sidibe had had training, although it was unorthodox. Upended by panic attacks, depression and bulimia, she had dropped out of college to attend an intensive, six-month program of dialectical behavioral therapy, at which her fellow patients called her “the happiest person at Sad Camp,” and from which she emerged with unlooked-for job skills like “active listening,” a linchpin of psychotherapy. “I put it on my résumé,” she said, “even though I had learned it as a patient, not a student.” (Since she didn’t yet have actual job skills, her therapist suggested telemarketing as a profession, though, “for some reason, I heard ‘phone sex,’” she said.)",
		"16" : "Active listening, Ms. Sidibe added, made her a terrific phone-sex operator, which in turn gave her acting chops, particularly since the “phone ho station,” as she called it, was staffed mostly by plus-size African-American women, all of whom were playing the role of a barely legal white teenager of limited intelligence.",
		"17" : "“I learned to talk to anyone,” she said, “to lead with my personality and to not be afraid. We’re all human.” Even the businessman who wears women’s underpants under his suit, she said, “maybe especially him,” though Ms. Sidibe was most moved by the soldiers calling from Afghanistan wanting to talk to someone who wasn’t, she said, “the person they were lonely for, because it only made them lonelier.”",
		"18" : "“So it was like a normal conversation,” she continued. “‘What kind of soda do you like?’ ‘What kind of beer?’”",
		"19" : "Phone work paid well, but she quit to play Precious. Money was tight after the film wrapped; she was paid scale, about $2,500 a week, but it took a month for her to receive her first check. After “Precious” made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009, Ms. Sidibe experienced fame without fortune, riding subways and buses to red carpet events. Life at home was still precarious. On the morning of one event, her landlord tried to evict the family for what turned out to be a clerical error.",
		"20" : "Her income that year was about $50,000, just under half of which was from the phone-sex work — and almost double what her mother made, earning Ms. Sidibe head of household status on the family tax returns, a position that made her anxious.",
		"21" : "Even after her Oscar nomination, and years of steady roles on shows like “American Horror Story” and “Empire,” and films like “Tower Heist,” money and family would continue to bedevil her. She took to paying her parents’ rents before paying her own, in a stew of guilt and pride, and constantly fielding entreaties from more distant relatives.",
		"22" : "Wouldn’t it be nice, Ms. Sidibe writes, “if money bought love? But it doesn’t. It buys resentment.”",
		"23" : "As museumgoers wandered in and out of the reading room, bemused by the sight of Ms. Sidibe and me hunkered down on a sofa there, she said: “Honestly, I think women in general have a lot of guilt. I think it’s a woman’s burden. I think even more so a black woman’s burden.",
		"24" : "“It’s the idea of the strong black woman. We’re put upon in so many different ways. And so my guilt comes from: ‘You know you should be nicer. I don’t care if you’re uncomfortable, you have to do this.’ I’ve been uncomfortable my whole life. I just don’t want to be uncomfortable anymore.”",
		"25" : "In 2014, Ms. Sidibe found herself courted by literary agents, after she spoke, along with Chelsea Handler and Amy Schumer, at a Ms. Foundation awards gala that was also a party for Ms. Steinem’s 80th birthday. The activist, actress and comedian Kathy Najimy said she was in charge of “curating the right voices, and Gabby seemed to be that perfect voice.” She recalled that after Ms. Sidibe spoke, it was like church.",
		"26" : "The speech involved a childhood memory and a crisis of confidence, a story about how Ms. Sidibe had baked cookies for a fourth-grade party and was shunned by her classmates. At first, Ms. Sidibe said, she sat glumly at her desk before taking herself in hand. “I was like, ‘This is also my party, and I’m going to have a good time,’” she said. “I was aware I was smart. I read books. I had zero friends. It wasn’t because I was fat. It was because I was” — and here she used a pungent expletive that had brought the house down that night at the gala. “I was really sarcastic and children don’t understand sarcasm.”",
		"27" : "“People are always asking me why or how I’m so confident,” Ms. Sidibe added, describing the essence of the talk. “But what they really mean is why are you so confident. They are not asking Rihanna. They are asking me, because they don’t think I should be. That’s what the cookie story was about, and that’s what started the book.”",
		"28" : "Ms. Najimy said: “Being heavy for her wasn’t about self hate. We had that in common: being a person in Hollywood who doesn’t look like a person should look in Hollywood. People can’t believe you walk through the world without fear because they are so paralyzed with fear about how they look. They can’t believe you have the confidence and the balls to get onstage, that you dress in cute clothes and are not ashamed.”",
		"29" : "In her book, Ms. Sidibe says, “My body sometimes feels like a tragedy, but I’m trying very hard to change my mind about that.”",
		"30" : "But she also acknowledges the power of her unconventional beauty, which makes this memoir a book you will want to give your daughter. Entertainment Weekly reported that it sold at auction for $2.5 million. “It wasn’t quite that much,” said David Kuhn, the agent she chose. Eighteen publishers, Mr. Kuhn said, had asked for a meeting with Ms. Sidibe, who was in town for just a few days and could meet with only 10. So he held a preauction to winnow her suitors.",
		"31" : "“I was ready to sell the book for $70,000,” Ms. Sidibe said. “It was much more than I expected. I was very surprised.”",
		"32" : "But readers of her Twitter and Instagram feeds, where she plays a modern, though still profane, Dorothy Parker, might not have been. “Gabby doesn’t just spew,” said Jussie Smollett, her co-star on “Empire,” the Fox series created by Mr. Daniels that is now in its third season. “She’s snappy and down with the clapback and hilarious without being mean.”",
		"33" : "Mr. Smollett plays Jamal, the “good” son, on the “Dallas”-like drama in which the family business is hip-hop, not oil, and Ms. Sidibe plays Becky, the long-suffering assistant to Lucious Lyon, the show’s patriarch and King Lear-figure, played by Terrence Howard.",
		"34" : "Mr. Smollett wrote to Ms. Sidibe years before they met on the set. It was just after “Precious” had made her a star, he said. “I had seen her on the red carpet and she was talking to Ryan Seacrest about Gerard Butler, and she said something like, ‘Yeah, I’d hit that.’” Mr. Smollett said he was entranced by her brashness. “‘Precious’ was so sad, but Gabby was a ball of happiness. I wrote her then and said: ‘I think we’re going to be best friends. You’re going to be the She-Ra to my He-Man.’ Then I got ‘Empire,’ and from that moment we’ve been like peanut butter and jelly.”",
		"35" : "Mr. Daniels remembered that after “Precious,” people said Ms. Sidibe would never work again. People would make the mistake — as he almost did — that no actor could nail the role, and they would continue to confuse Ms. Sidibe with the character of “Precious.” In those early years of her career, interviewers were surprised that she was not, in fact, a beaten-down illiterate teenager.",
		"36" : "The internet was predictably vicious. “Whale, gorilla, elephant” were typical epithets for Precious, she said, along with more insidious commentary. “A lot of people were concerned that I was ‘promoting unhealthy eating habits,’” she writes. “Funny. I could’ve sworn I was promoting a movie.”",
		"37" : "At Halloween, people would dress up as Precious by stuffing sweatshirts with pillows and blackening their faces, and her friends would send her photos because they found them funny and thought she would, too. Ms. Sidibe writes of the time she overheard André Leon Talley, the Vogue editor, on speaker phone with Mr. Daniels, crowing: “I am putting that fat bitch right on the cover of Vogue. I love her. That black bitch will be on the cover.”",
		"38" : "Mr. Daniels pointed out that the word can be a term of endearment. “I think it was said in love,” he recalled, adding that he was rather large at the time. “It was almost a militant, defiant statement about the movie.”",
		"39" : "But even though Ms. Sidibe might have joined in had she been in the room, she was stung.",
		"40" : "“I know what I looked like, I had mirrors in my home,” she writes. “But at the time I thought that if I could just get the world to see me the way I saw myself, then my body wouldn’t be the thing you walked away thinking about.”",
		"41" : "When she decided last spring to have bariatric surgery after years of living secretly with diabetes, the first doctor she interviewed confused her with Amber Riley, another young, black plus-size actor. Ms. Sidibe went with another surgeon. She told only one person about her “very grown-up surgery,” her friend Kia Perry, who took care of her.",
		"42" : "Then Ms. Sidibe told Mr. Daniels. “He’s like, ‘Bitch, what are you doing?’” she recalled in the interview. “I’m like, ‘Cocaine?’”",

		"44" : "“No, I don’t think so,” she said. “I try my best. I’m very sensitive to this question. Even when someone is really tall, I try not to be like, ‘Wow, you’re tall!’ because that person effing knows. I don’t want to talk about my body. I’m bored with it. I wrote about it because I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "On Friday afternoon, in a closed-off gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, teams of workers, some in lab coats and shoe covers, were circling through a makeshift village of stark white huts, fixing mannequins and laying down guide numbers. It was the homestretch before the Costume Institute’s spring show, “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” was set to open, and the pieces that Ms. Kawakubo has designed over decades for Comme des Garçons, the fashion label she founded in 1969, waited for their final installation.",
		"2" : "It is usually a safe assumption that the Costume Institute’s exhibitions will be filled with garments, but what Ms. Kawakubo creates is not all even recognizably clothing. The pieces may be elaborately bulbous or bulging; tatty or fraying; they may or may not make allowances for their wearer’s arms, or faces, or vanity.",
		"3" : "Many designers work with the goal of making women look good. Ms. Kawakubo seems to work with the goal of making women look again.",
		"4" : "Ms. Kawakubo appeared in the Met gallery on Friday, in her constant uniform of fringed bob and black leather motorcycle jacket, a day after arriving from Tokyo, where she lives and where Comme des Garçons has its headquarters.",
		"5" : "Officially, Ms. Kawakubo does not speak English, communicating her Delphic instructions via her husband, translator and company president, Adrian Joffe, though she understands more than she lets on, and if sufficiently interested or engaged, will lean forward to address an English speaker directly. Mostly, her silence seems useful and convenient, as it discourages two things she abhors: explanation and interpretation. (She will never offer more insight, publicly, into any of her collections than the enigmatic title she gives each one.)",
		"6" : "We tend to project serenity upon the silent, but in person, Ms. Kawakubo has the tense energy of a coiled spring, or a set trap. She presides over Comme des Garçons, which has grown to encompass several lines and several other designers, as a benevolent but unchallengeable autocrat, and she can be military in her decisiveness, as Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator in charge, learned while working on the exhibition.",
		"7" : "Ms. Kawakubo designed the exhibition space, working on a full-size prototype in a warehouse in Tokyo, which is as much her sui generis creation as any of the pieces inside.",
		"8" : "The plan was for her to walk through the Met space with me, but upon arriving at the museum, she decided against it. And though Mr. Joffe offered a few words in Japanese when I asked for negotiation, it was clear that her decision would be law. So I spun through the gallery myself, with Mr. Joffe and Mr. Bolton in tow, to take the measure of Ms. Kawakubo’s achievement before we were to speak in a chilly conference room downstairs.",
		"9" : "Ms. Kawakubo is a legend in the world of fashion, and the exhibition is a ratification of her unique stature: The Costume Institute has not devoted an entire show to a single, living designer since Yves Saint Laurent in 1983. (And Ms. Kawakubo’s presence at the opening night gala on Monday will be her first appearance at what has long been called “the party of the year.”)",
		"10" : "For decades, at least since her Paris debut in 1981, Ms. Kawakubo has forged her own path, a durable antagonist of established norms and received wisdoms. She has gone into and out of favor over the years, but she has been at the forefront of important developments in fashion all along. She arrived early to ideas still potent and percolating within the fashion ecosystem: androgyny, artificiality, the pop-up shop, the luxury group (she has encouraged several former assistants, most notably Junya Watanabe, in the creation of their own separate lines under the aegis of Comme des Garçons).",
		"11" : "“What’s inspiring is that for her, the body and the dress body have no limits,” Mr. Bolton said. “That’s what I grew to really appreciate.”",
		"12" : "The exhibition, 150 outfits in all, is overpowering. Ms. Kawakubo’s designs are outrageous, radical and beautiful, united in their variety by the wild extremity of her commitment to creating newness at every outing. They can be coquettish, as the furred and feathered masses (from the collection she called “Blue Witch,” spring 2016), or cartoonish, like paper-doll dresses in crayon-colored felt (“2 Dimensions,” fall 2012).",
		"13" : "They can be fragile, like the hole-pocked sweaters (“Holes,” fall 1982) that are the oldest pieces gathered here, or tough, like a jagged skirt and top in what looks like leather but is in fact rayon and polyurethane (“Tomorrow’s Black,” spring 2009). In some cases, like a series of looks that pair tutus with biker jackets, they can be all of the above (“Ballerina Motorbike,” spring 2005).",
		"14" : "Her clothes can have a sly wit, but they can also flirt with the absurd. Ms. Kawakubo rarely stoops to flatter in any traditional sense. (Critics saw tumors and deformities in her padded “Body Meets Dress — Dress Meets Body” collection for spring 1997; Merce Cunningham saw beauty and requested others for a dance piece.)",
		"15" : "Comme des Garçons breeds passionate acolytes, whose mantra is “Comme” as yogis’ is “om,” but skeptics and doubters, too. “These clothes, honestly, are walking pieces of art,” said Katy Perry, who modeled them for the cover of Vogue, and who is one of the co-chairs of the gala. She also said, “Let me know when ‘Zoolander 3’ starts shooting.”",
		"16" : "That is how Ms. Kawakubo prefers it. Comme des Garçons is about “proposing a new beauty,” she said. She does not expect everyone to like Comme des Garçons any more than she expects everyone to wear Comme des Garçons.",
		"17" : "“That’s the ultimate aim, of course, that’s the best,” Mr. Joffe said, translating for Ms. Kawakubo, and occasionally adding his own opinion as well. “But really, if everyone came and saw the beauty of it and tried it on and felt amazing, that’s the end. If everybody thought it was beautiful, it would be time for Rei to stop. The times we’ve had standing ovations, when absolutely everybody loved the show, were the times she has worried the most.” (More than one collection deemed too readily understandable was withheld from the show.)",
		"18" : "Ms. Kawakubo’s clothes seem to simultaneously invite allusions and refuse them. One of the Met’s curators of 20th-century art popped into the exhibition, Mr. Bolton said, and saw an echo of Diane Arbus. Mr. Bolton himself, schooled in the history of dress, saw mutant panniers and frocks.",
		"19" : "“But what’s more interesting is, if or if not that’s the reference, it was obliterated,” said Mr. Bolton, who structured the exhibition around pairs of binary themes — absence/presence, fashion/antifashion, high/low, then/now — to show how Ms. Kawakubo’s work could be both and neither, in between and somewhere else entirely. “That was a real challenge for me as a curator, to try to free my mind up from imposing historical narratives,” he said.",
		"20" : "“Unlike what most journalists do,” said Mr. Joffe, arching an eyebrow. “They can’t resist a reference, can they?”",
		"21" : "Seated downstairs, dwarfed behind a large library table, Ms. Kawakubo emphasized over and over again that the point, and the struggle, was to create something new. Everything else is secondary.",
		"22" : "“Doing something new doesn’t necessarily have to be beautiful in the eyes of the people who look at it,” she said. “The result of doing something new is beautiful. The fact of doing something new and people being moved by it is what’s beautiful.”",
		"23" : "She starts every season from scratch, presenting a gnomic kernel of inspiration to her patternmakers, and together they flesh out a collection. But once it is done, Ms. Kawakubo moves mercilessly on to the next, and one byproduct of this is that confronting her past work, even in the setting of a museum, is difficult for her — “physically painful,” Mr. Bolton said. He and Ms. Kawakubo came to understand and respect each another, but their collaboration was not without conflict.",
		"24" : "I asked Ms. Kawakubo what an exhibition she herself curated would have looked like.",
		"25" : "“Probably just the last thing I ever made,” she said.",
		"26" : "The last one thing?",
		"27" : "She fixed me with a stare. “The only one, yes,” she said in English.",
		"28" : "Having done the show makes looking forward more difficult, Mr. Joffe said, as Ms. Kawakubo spoke rapidly to him in a soft, steady stream, barely lifting her voice or shifting her tone, and circled her hands over the tabletop, a chunky watch disappearing up her leather sleeve.",
		"29" : "“She’s often talked about the burden of experience, that the more she does, the harder it is to do something she hasn’t done before,” Mr. Joffe said. “But before it was just memory. Now it’s in front of her face, all the things she’s done — she feels it might be harder now to carry on.”",
		"30" : "Though it covers 35 years of work, she insisted the exhibition not be conceived as a “retrospective.” For a designer obsessed by the new, not much separates the museum from the mausoleum.",
		"31" : "Inevitably, a show like this is a lifetime-achievement award, with the ushering off the stage such awards imply. Ms. Kawakubo, however, at 74, is in no way interested in departing. The company is so entirely fused with her that when I asked whether there was any part of her that was not Comme des Garçons, she said she did not understand the question.",
		"32" : "Yet she has considered the future of Comme des Garçons after her. “It can’t be the same,” she said, “but it can be.” The specter of mortality hangs over some of her late work. Beginning with her spring 2014 collection, she declared she would stop making clothing, and in the time since, has turned her attention to more abstract investigations of silhouette, form and function. The collections of recent seasons are not the textbook definition of “wearable” or “salable.”",
		"33" : "But Ms. Kawakubo is shrewd. The Comme des Garçons company is set up, with its many lines, diffusions and subsidiaries, so that each part can support another. (The company’s total revenues were over $280 million last year, including its Dover Street Market multibrand stores; the Met will have its own Comme gift shop set up, with exclusive products, like a Nike sneaker with a gold-welded CDG logo and a new version of the iconic holey sweater from 1982, Ms. Kawakubo’s “lace.”)",
		"34" : "Her spirit and her values guide the entire Comme des Garçons enterprise, but not all newness is created equal. And it is because the company does a brisk trade in its more digestible, commercial collections, like the heart-studded Play line, its wallets and its fragrances, that Ms. Kawakubo is free to be as esoteric as she wants with her most obsessional creations, the runway collection she shows for the main Comme des Garçons line.",
		"35" : "It is a measure of her cult appeal that even Ms. Kawakubo’s not-clothes are desirable to her most ardent fans, and unlike many other labels, which show fantasy on the runway but reality in the shops, Comme des Garçons sells its showpieces too — to its founder’s occasional irritation.",
		"36" : "“She gets really upset because she doesn’t want to make them,” Mr. Joffe said. “They’re so difficult.”",
		"37" : "But if they are artworks — if Ms. Perry is right — Ms. Kawakubo is adamant that she is not an artist. “There are very few designers working today whose body of work could sustain itself in the context of an art museum,” Mr. Bolton had said earlier, but Ms. Kawakubo considers herself a businesswoman first and foremost. I noted that she had long maintained this, but in recent interviews this certainty seemed to be wavering, and she appeared closer to agreeing that perhaps she was an artist after all.",
		"38" : "Mr. Joffe nodded and smiled, but when he relayed this to Ms. Kawakubo, she grew agitated and began speaking rapidly. “She said it’s my fault for translating badly,” he said. “She’s not an artist.” She gestured to my notebook, that I should write this down. “Please make sure,” she said.",
		"39" : "If not an artist, then a punk. “Punk is very important,” she said. “The spirit of punk is being against the establishment. That’s how you can start from zero to make something new — you don’t accept the existing order of things.”",
		"40" : "I pointed out that she was currently enshrined in the temple of the establishment, the Met.",
		"41" : "“The fact of being here is rebellious,” Mr. Joffe said. “The fact of her being here is punk enough. Of course there’s going to be people saying we sold out, why are we on the cover of Vogue? But it’s not the point.” Ms. Kawakubo nodded.",
		"42" : "Perhaps the point is the work, and, if I may suggest it, the legacy. Comme des Garçons’ influence has been felt in fashion for decades, and not always in the obvious ways of imitation and homage. Ms. Kawakubo has raised the stock of exposed seams, asymmetry, synthetic fabrics and the color black, but more than that she has kept her own course with a steadfastness and a single-mindedness that others have absorbed, and begun a conversation whose thread others have taken up.",
		"43" : "I wondered, not for the first time, what she thought of her legacy. I reminded her that we had done one interview before, by mail, four years ago. I had asked her then how she wanted to be remembered. She had answered, “I want to be forgotten.” Had that feeling changed?",
		"44" : "“It is more and more true,” she said. “I’m not doing another exhibition, that’s for sure.”",
		"45" : "There is a bleakness to her uncompromising worldview that can be startling, even uncomfortable. But then a thought occurred to her, and she smiled slightly as she turned and murmured something to Mr. Joffe.",
		"46" : "“If you write that as she said it,” he said, “that this is the last exhibition, she wonders whether more people would come to see it.”",
		"47" : "The woman is a marketing genius, I said, and Ms. Kawakubo began to laugh.",
		"48" : "“You should say at the end, absolutely, I am a businesswoman,” she said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Anyone whose childhood included a move up to a new, better home remembers it as grander than it was.",
		"2" : "When I was 5, I saw our new home as extending endlessly in every direction. It soared above a vast, churning river on one side and a hectic port on the other. It was exactly the building my kindergarten self would have built, stacking blocks to the verge of collapse. Its pleasures left me breathless the first day I woke up there and most mornings after.",
		"3" : "In my case, this memory of relocation is not overblown. My parents moved us from Philadelphia to Montreal in 1968, into a housing complex called Habitat, which had been completed the previous summer as the experimental housing pavilion for Expo 67, the Montreal world’s fair.",
		"4" : "Built on a spit of land separating the rapids of the great St. Lawrence River from the working waters of Montreal’s port, Habitat’s 158 apartments fill 354 cast-concrete boxes, piled 11 stories high in a madcap mess of cantilevers and bridges and perilous open spaces — like (guess what) a stack of children’s blocks. For sheer sensory excitement, Habitat could not and cannot be matched. Every minute in the building felt unlike the next, as space, light, air and sound danced around you. My parents built a jungle-gym on one of our terraces, but the building was the best climbing frame of all.",
		"5" : "Habitat turns 50 this spring, and its excellence is being celebrated well beyond my family. Canada’s post office has just announced a Habitat stamp, the first in a series for the nation’s 150th birthday.",
		"6" : "In June a major exhibition on the structure, now declared a historic monument, opens at the Centre de design de l’UQAM in Montreal. The show will include public tours of a Habitat apartment restored to its original space-age state, with fiberglass bathrooms cast in one piece and futuristic push-button light switches — one white dot for “on” and a black one for “off.” (By some weird coincidence, the apartment being toured this summer is the same one I grew up in.)",
		"7" : "Habitat is a prime example of our postwar love of raw concrete architecture. For a little while, from the late 1950s to the early ’70s, concrete seemed to be the civic, public alternative to the steel and glass buildings that represented the corporate world, Mad Men-slick and meant to sell us on the polished ease of the capitalist way, reflected back and forth across the hall of mirrors of New York’s Park Avenue.",
		"8" : "Poured concrete, in contrast, was honest and audacious in avowing its bulk, primeval and pretense-free for an age that still doubted the perfection of the new corporate model and sometimes pushed back against it. It became the preferred material for libraries, universities and courts, in a style that has now come to be known as Brutalism.",
		"9" : "But after flourishing for those few years, these concrete buildings began to be described as simply brutal, and in recent years many have been demolished. The American Press Institute’s building in Reston, Va., designed by the great Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer, who was also responsible for the former Whitney Museum on Madison Avenue in New York, was destroyed last year.",
		"10" : "The Third Church of Christ, Scientist, one of the few notable buildings near the White House, was torn down in 2014, even though it had once been described by the architectural historian Richard Longstreth as “an enduring monument to the human faith in God and the extraordinary power with which that faith can be expressed.” But the church’s parishioners didn’t share his faith in Brutalism and started describing their home as a “bunker”— the standard insult that just about every cast-concrete building has suffered at one time or another. (“How do you live with all that cement,” my schoolmates would ask. “With delight” was the only answer. They understood once they visited.)",
		"11" : "If only those Brutalist structures could have held on just a bit longer. The style’s charms are being rediscovered. If it is true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Habitat’s concrete should be blushing.",
		"12" : "“In the schools, you see that the students are into it again,” said Moshe Safdie, Habitat’s designer, speaking by phone from his firm’s offices near Boston. “Several of my peers are doing buildings influenced by it.”",
		"13" : "Mr. Safdie is now one of the world’s leading architects, but he conceived of his Expo project while still a student at McGill University. He was all of 28 when it opened. He said that after a 50-year career spent designing institutions (the Crystal Bridges museum in Arkansas is a recent standout), contracts for housing are pouring in for the first time, “and it’s completely linked to people’s interest in Habitat.” His student project, he said, feels “as though it was built yesterday.”",
		"14" : "Its current imitators seem to agree. A vast new complex planned for downtown Toronto, with a haphazard-looking stack of blocky modules, is utterly indebted to the Safdie building. Its cutting-edge architect, Bjarke Ingels of Denmark, has referred to it as “Habitat 2.0” and he ended a recent speech with an admission of influence that is rare in his profession: “Canada started something 50 years ago. Now we are picking up where Moshe Safdie left off.”",
		"15" : "In just the last few years, books on vintage poured-concrete buildings have started to appear faster than they can be read. Walking tours of Brutalist masterpieces, in cities around the world, are now competing with ones that point out Victorian terra cotta and Art Deco metalwork.",
		"16" : "Last fall, a British publishing house called Blue Crow Media added a “Brutalist Washington” map to a series that includes maps of Brutalism in London, Paris and Sydney, Australia. The one on Washington, D.C., was the brainchild of a local writer named Deane Madsen, a fan of postwar concrete who was also aware of the abuse it still suffers. “I’d seen so many lists of the least popular and ugliest buildings in D.C., and almost all were Brutalist,” said Mr. Madsen in a recent phone call.",
		"17" : "His map applauds concrete buildings like the cylindrical Hirshhorn Museum, once reviled but now widely admired, and the block-spanning F.B.I. headquarters, still so disliked that its demolition seems almost certain.",
		"18" : "We’ve lived to regret such destruction before, the standard cautionary tale being New York’s Pennsylvania Station. It fell in 1963 when it was seen as an outdated 50-year-old. (“Not, architecturally, a monument,” was the judgment of the real estate developer Irving M. Felt, whose Madison Square Garden replaced the station. The New York Times critic Herbert Muschamp agreed, writing in 2006 that pulling in there was like “arriving in Philadelphia two hours before you had to.”) Penn Station fell at precisely the moment when its out-of-date architecture was beginning to find some new love — it was mourned almost at once — just as Brutalist buildings are doing on their 50th birthdays.",
		"19" : "Mr. Madsen, the Washington writer, has a theory about why vintage concrete is making a comeback at this particular moment: For all the challenges Brutalism can pose to some users, he said, its bold forms and highly textured surfaces make it utterly camera-friendly, perfect fare for our Instagram age. What was once a highly theorized Architecture of Truth, with profound social goals and implications, has come to be loved as a pure aesthetic. Passing time has made it trade complexity and depth for a wider surface appeal.",
		"20" : "That means Brutalism is suffering (or enjoying) the same fate as most modern movements. The Impressionism of Claude Monet, once derided as incomprehensibly ugly and abstruse, now counts as evidently and simply attractive; the Pop Art of Andy Warhol, originally seen as utterly conceptual and counteraesthetic, now decorates strollers. With our new love of cast concrete, it looks as if we’ve learned to see the beauty in what once counted as bleak.",
		"21" : "A few weeks ago, the United States Commission of Fine Arts, a body normally busy with our capital’s neo-Classical-style monuments, chastised Washington’s transportation authority for painting the concrete in one of its 1970s Metro stations. The commission complained that the paint threatened “the architectural character of this exemplary transit system” (exemplary, it so happens, for its Brutalism).",
		"22" : "My Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood in New York is known for its ornate Victorian tenements, now beloved for the very curlicues that once won them abuse. A new kind of ornament is joining them: On a prime lot at Ninth Avenue and 42nd Street, near Times Square, a generic skyscraper that would once have been faced in clichéd glass or metal has instead been surfaced in raw concrete — which now, but only now, counts as a suitably decorative finish for a building that will house a trendy Pod hotel.",
		"23" : "Just up the street on 10th Avenue, ground has been cleared for a condo building that takes its Brutalist roots more to heart. It will be faced in precast concrete panels designed to have some of the same visual texture and complexity as its most photogenic postwar ancestors, including Habitat.",
		"24" : "That’s because the new building’s architect, Jonathan J. Marvel, has been a fan of Moshe Safdie’s for far longer than most of his peers. In another of this article’s peculiar coincidences, Mr. Marvel actually visited Habitat the year it was born, when he was all of 7. (He had been brought to Expo for the debut of a second great building there: the American Pavilion’s giant geodesic dome by Buckminster Fuller, Mr. Marvel’s great-uncle.)",
		"25" : "“I grew up with cast concrete on my brain,” Mr. Marvel said. It was a favorite material of his father’s, one of Puerto Rico’s leading architects. He also has memories of a hillside in San Juan scattered with unused concrete boxes from a second Habitat that Mr. Safdie never got the chance to complete.",
		"26" : "“I’ve been thinking about Habitat for a long, long time,” Mr. Marvel said. But until now, he had encountered resistance to echoing it, among clients for whom Brutalism still evoked ideas of the brutal. (The style’s name in fact comes from béton brut, the neutral French term for “raw concrete.”) Mr. Marvel counts it a privilege to be working at a moment when it’s finally possible to pay homage to one of the great buildings of our recent past.",
		"27" : "“Habitat is absolutely fantastic, and daring, and cool,” he said.",
		"28" : "Anyone who has lived there would agree."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Bruce Hampton, a singer, guitarist, songwriter and bandleader known for his energetic, eccentric style and widely regarded as the granddaddy of the jam-band scene, died on Monday in Atlanta. He was 70.",
		"2" : "His death was confirmed by Eric Sliz of the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.",
		"3" : "Mr. Hampton, who for years called himself “colonel” before officially adding the abbreviated title to his name in 2000, collapsed onstage at the Fox Theater in the waning moments of a concert in honor of his 70th birthday.",
		"4" : "The concert, billed as “Hampton 70: A Celebration of Col. Bruce Hampton,” was coming to a close with an encore performance of the song “Turn On Your Love Light” when he collapsed, Blake Budney, manager of the Tedeschi Trucks Band, whose members were in attendance, said in an interview.",
		"5" : "He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, Mr. Budney said.",
		"6" : "Mr. Hampton was born on April 30, 1947. He was born in Tennessee and grew up in Atlanta, according to a biography on the website of Terminus Records, which has released several of his albums.",
		"7" : "He first gained attention in the late 1960s and early ’70s as the leader of the Hampton Grease Band, which Robert Palmer of The New York Times labeled “one of the more cockeyed rock groups” of the era and “a mischievous, mystifying group.”",
		"8" : "The band’s music was an unusual and, for many listeners, bewildering mix of elements, from the blues to avant-garde jazz to Mr. Hampton’s growling vocals. Critics, Mr. Palmer wrote, called its music “eclectic” — meaning, he said, that it drew from a number of sources and they could not figure out what else to call it.",
		"9" : "The Hampton Grease Band released an album on Columbia — Mr. Hampton liked to claim that it was one of the worst-selling albums in the label’s history — and opened for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers Band and other nationally known acts. It was also known for its twisted sense of humor, which included playing practical jokes.",
		"10" : "The band once opened a concert for Three Dog Night by playing its own off-kilter versions of that group’s hits, according to a report in The Times. The move elicited boos, and the Hampton Grease Band responded with a lengthy encore. They were, Mr. Palmer quoted a Columbia executive as saying, “the most outrageous group anybody here ever had to deal with.”",
		"11" : "The Hampton Grease Band broke up in 1973. In the decades that followed, Mr. Hampton would form or help form a number of other acts, including the Aquarium Rescue Unit, the Fiji Mariners and the Code Talkers. Along the way he became known as one of the seminal figures of the improvisation-oriented, genre-crossing jam-band movement.",
		"12" : "“Bruce Hampton is the 1970s rock star who wasn’t: a comic, bearish, dadaist spieler with a deep Georgia accent, a Dalí in the body of a Southern wrestler,” Ben Ratliff of The Times wrote in a review of a Code Talkers performance in 2001.",
		"13" : "Many critics labeled Mr. Hampton’s music “surrealist.” In a video interview posted in June, he was asked who he was and, with a laugh, offered an absurdist answer: “It’s a mix of 103 people. I’m not sure I exist.”",
		"14" : "Friends and family said Mr. Hampton was also a mentor to many musicians, with a keen eye and ear for talent. His influence on groups like Phish, Widespread Panic and the Dave Matthews Band and his dedication to aiding young musicians’ careers were, they said, perhaps the most lasting element of his legacy.",
		"15" : "Mr. Hampton’s survivors include his wife, Sara, and a brother, Jim.",
		"16" : "“He taught me how to be weird,” James Forrest Hampton III, who identified himself as Mr. Hampton’s nephew, wrote in a message posted on Facebook, “and how weird was good.”",
		"17" : "Many of Mr. Hampton’s associates also noted the seemingly appropriate end to his life.",
		"18" : "“Bruce was the only person I could think of who has ever played at his own funeral, because in essence, that’s what he did,” Scott McKinney, a bluegrass musician known professionally as Fudd who said that he had known Mr. Hampton more than 20 years, said in a telephone interview. “Bruce couldn’t script it any better.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "What does it mean, as the invitation requested, to dress “Avant-Garde”?",
		"2" : "This was the question on Monday night at the Met Gala, the annual fund-raising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, and the answer was always going to be a doozy. On the one hand, the term avant-garde implies all sorts of things: pushing boundaries, breaking rules, going where no one else has gone before. On the other, the gala, one of the most-watched, celebrity-packed red carpet events of the year, has come to imply a lot of other things, chief among them major fashion-brand marketing moments (you know: put movie star in dress, have movie star identify dress, send picture round the world). These are not necessarily compatible imperatives.",
		"3" : "How to reconcile the two was the challenge. Especially because the obvious move — wear clothes from Comme des Garçons, the brand being celebrated at the event, the subject of the exhibition the party was honoring, and the inspiration for the dress code itself — seemed largely off the table. Though whether that was because the truly avant-garde nature of the work of Rei Kawakubo, the brand’s founder and designer, was simply too scary for most people-page regulars, or because CdG does not pay celebrities to wear its clothes, and has no official “face” or “ambassadors,” was unclear.",
		"4" : "There were, for sure, some brave souls: Pharrell Williams, an event co-chairman, in ripped jeans, “Rei” inked on the knee, plaid shirt and motorcycle jacket; his wife, Helen Lasichanh, in a red jumpsuit that flattened and haloed the body and had no armholes; Michèle Lamy, the partner of the designer Rick Owens, in snaking red and pink vinyl waves; and Rihanna, swallowed up in a boa constrictor of chintz ruffles, femininity on the rampage. In CdG, all.",
		"5" : "Also Tracee Ellis Ross in a terrific sapphire swaddling CdG coat dress that skewed her proportions in an elegantly off-center way and — best of all — Caroline Kennedy, the former ambassador to Japan, in steroid-stoked floral tiers that put paid to the idea that CdG was unwearable. If she could do it, well, what was everyone else doing?",
		"6" : "Paying homage (or playing it safe — but that’s another story). Which is to say, taking bits and pieces from the CdG oeuvre and attempting to make them their own. The exhibition itself is titled “The Art of the In-Between,” and the ethos of the evening seemed to be “In Between Rei and [insert brand name here].” The results ranged from the interesting to the pretty silly to the eye-rollingly banal.",
		"7" : "Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid seemed, for example, to have taken inspiration from Ms. Kawakubo’s statement in 2013 that she had decided to stop making clothes for her runway collections (she was making “objects for the body”) and decided that they, too, would stop wearing clothes; they would wear underwear!",
		"8" : "So Ms. Jenner was in a La Perla crystal mesh scrim-like gown atop a body thong with a giant slash cut down the front, and Ms. Hadid was in an Alexander Wang crystal mesh catsuit. Nicki Minaj wore H & M satin hot pants beneath a flowing cape-dress of sparkling red and black, and Hailee Steinfeld wore a Vera Wang version of the same look, both open in the front to show the legs.",
		"9" : "Because really, who needs a dress, when you can have the idea of a dress? Not Kylie Jenner, in floral-and-tinsel-strewn see-through Versace, or Halle Berry, also in Versace, with black and white feathers sprouting from the train. Though, pointedly, that former proponent of the naked look, Jennifer Lopez, was demure in powder blue Valentino. Ditto Kim Kardashian West in baptismal white Vivienne Westwood that showed — shock! — her shoulders. Sometimes what’s really startling is upending expectations.",
		"10" : "Still, red, apparently in reference to Ms. Kawakubo’s “Roses and Blood” collection of 2014, was the color of the evening, on everyone from Katy Perry, an event co-chairwoman, who wore a sparkling, skeletonized Maison Margiela Artisanal red trench under a floor-length red veil decorated with a variety of doodads; to Emma Roberts, in a simple Diane von Furstenberg sheath dress; Ashley Graham in ruffled and corseted H & M; and Rami Malek in a crimson Dior Homme tux. And the yin and yang of shredding and exaggeration were the design strategies.",
		"11" : "See, for example, Kerry Washington in patchworked silver-and-black Michael Kors, the edges not quite lined up; Celine Dion in a cut-and-paste Versace ball gown/T-shirt; and Claire Danes in a rent-and-ruffled Monse pirate shirt, the asymmetric train framing her skinny black trousers (There were a lot of trousers, though my favorite was Evan Rachel Wood’s Altuzarra midnight-sky slip-dress/cigarette pant combo). See Janelle Monáe frothing and foaming at the skirt in Ralph & Russo, and Gigi Hadid in a half-samurai, half-boudoir Tommy Hilfiger number that got compared, on social media, to bad sushi.",
		"12" : "Less obvious, and better for it, were Jaden Smith in simple black Louis Vuitton clutching his cutoff dreadlocks as an accessory (really), and Priyanka Chopra in a classic Ralph Lauren trench coatdress — with a witchy collar and a swirling, stair-sweeping train. Both played to tradition and entirely undermined it. Which is to say, they managed to enter into the spirit of the evening while also maintaining a certain elegant integrity.",
		"13" : "It’s not an easy balance to achieve. Little wonder that many guests threw up their hands and chose to go with a theme of a different kind: Elle Fanning channeling “Frozen” in a strapless empire-waisted ice-blue princess Miu Miu; Zendaya in a Tropicana fantasy ball gown from Dolce & Gabbana; Katie Holmes in a ye olde Hollywood Zac Posen fishtail; Dakota Johnson in sexy Victorian-governess Gucci; and Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen in outfits that looked like they had been sourced from the costume department of “Game of Thrones.” That’s breaking the rules in a way, I guess.",
		"14" : "Though perhaps ultimately the most avant-garde of all the approaches was the one evinced by both Anna Wintour, a co-chairwoman of the event, and Ms. Kawakubo herself: Ignore the dress code entirely. Ignore even the idea of a dress code.",
		"15" : "Instead, Ms. Wintour chose Chanel, as she has done at every Met Gala in recent memory (this time a sparkle-encrusted T-shirt gown with a swath of fur at the knee giving way to lighter underskirt). Ms. Kawakubo chose a white jacket and black skirt, a simple variation on her usual uniform — with sneakers. It’s their party, and they’ll wear what they want to."

		"1" : "She scurried up the Met Gala red carpet so quickly that if you blinked you probably missed her. She did not stand for two hours on the receiving line with some of the evening’s glittering co-hosts, among them Anna Wintour, Katy Perry and Tom Brady. And for a while, the guest of honor was quipping that she might skip the Monday night event altogether.",
		"2" : "And yet, a little after 7 p.m., there was the Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo huddled near the entrance of the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Exhibition Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dressed in a slightly spruced-up version of her everyday outfit (her usual black leather motorcycle jacket swapped for a white one, a silver tiara perched on her trademark bob), and not only receiving the congratulations of well-wishers like Bruce Weber and the 10 Corso Como retailer Carla Sozzani, but also posing gamely for a few pictures.",
		"3" : "Ms. Kawakubo is shy to the point of reclusive, quiet to the point of absent, and indifferent to the celebrities other designers court. Who are, naturally, just the people who came flooding into the Met for a gala opening that is New York’s biggest social night of the year and which, this time, raised more than $12 million for the Costume Institute.",
		"4" : "Andrew Bolton, the exhibition’s curator, looked happy and relieved, not least by the good reaction from his subject. “There’s been a change over the last few days,” he said, his partner, Thom Browne, alongside. “I think she’s almost enjoying it.” He paused. “Almost.”",
		"5" : "Meanwhile, around the serene-looking Ms. Kawakubo, guests circled the galleries wonderingly. Mr. Weber, who shot some memorable Comme des Garçons mailers in the 1980s, had brought his camera and was snapping away; Rick Owens, with his wife, Michèle Lamy, one of the few brave and chic enough to wear Comme, were looking around in awe. Ms. Kawakubo’s creations are not for the faint of heart.",
		"6" : "“I wear it so conservatively,” said Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, the creative director and longtime Comme collaborator, who was wearing a large dress from Ms. Kawakubo’s “Invisible Clothes” collection, crowned with a headband studded with spikes. It, too, was by Ms. Kawakubo. For men.",
		"7" : "The others who did — including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Tracee Ellis Ross, Stella Tennant, Anna Cleveland and Caroline Kennedy — looked marvelous. Ms. Ross, in a high-collared floral Comme des Garçons coatdress, said she had been a fan for years.",
		"8" : "“It’s the merging of art and fashion in a way that pushed the boundaries,” she said. “It’s just everything to me. And I can do this!” She ducked her head into the high collar of her coat, like a glamorous turtle in retreat. “I think I did it on the red carpet.”",
		"9" : "Mindy Kaling, who was working her way through the exhibition with Gary Ross, her director on “Ocean’s Eight,” said she was also a fan, “although I must say I feel only bold enough to wear separates and perfume and accessories.” She is also the veteran of previous Met Galas, real and fictionalized. The gala is featured in “Ocean’s Eight,” and the cast spent 10 days filming at the museum.",
		"10" : "“I staged my own,” Mr. Ross said. “Now I’m seeing theirs as a civilian. I find it much more relaxing to be a civilian than have to direct. It’s fun to be here.”",
		"11" : "Part of the fun is the people-watching, which is heady. Once upon a time, the Met Gala was a smaller, more socialite-driven event (“You look even lovelier than when you first came,” a courtly older gentleman told Carolina Herrera, the designer and perennial social fixture), but now, free-range stars mingle and kibitz. Laura Dern, dressed by and on the arm of the designer Gabriela Hearst, was about to weigh in on the exhibition when she was interrupted by her “Big Little Lies” co-star, Alexander Skarsgard, who played a villainous husband of Monterey, Calif., in the mini-series.",
		"12" : "“Look at this lovely man!” Ms. Dern exclaimed. “Now everybody’s scared of him.”",
		"13" : "Mr. Skarsgard said: “I’ve been in the woods for two months and I got back two days ago. I haven’t even seen the show. I got back and people are like, ‘Ooh … no.” He laughed. “So I’ll never work again. But we had a good time.”",
		"14" : "Downstairs, in the Petrie sculpture court, where cocktails were served, the celebrity swell was growing. Here and there were a few CDG touches, like the “Live Free Die Strong Comme des Garçons” jacket that the Oscar de la Renta and Monse designer Laura Kim had over her dress, or the Comme des Garçons Play heart logo patch that Ms. Kim had removed from one of her T-shirts and stitched on to her co-designer Fernando Garcia’s tuxedo. (“I’m going to put it back tomorrow,” she said.) With them was Zoë Kravitz, in a blush-pink Oscar de la Renta gown with a bodice of real, preserved roses. She wasn’t wearing Comme, but she still had one of the night’s savviest reviews: Comme is “so modern and feminine and weird,” she said. “Exactly what fashion should be.”",
		"15" : "Serena Williams, pregnant and glowing in a green gown by Atelier Versace (“I feel good,” she said), was catching up with her old friend Vera Wang. Were they Comme fans? “I’ve actually never worked with them,” Ms. Williams said. “But I love their stuff. It’s so forward, so fashion. It’s something you’re really inspired by.”",
		"16" : "Ms. Wang is not only an admirer; “I’m a client, too!” she said. “That’s even better. Fully participating, all the way. For a long time, too.”",
		"17" : "But as the throng grew denser, most guests seemed blithely unaware of Ms. Kawakubo and her small retinue in a corner, just as she would probably prefer. Selena Gomez and Abel Tesfaye (a.k.a. the Weeknd) were holding hands by the bar. Eddie Redmayne was deep in conversation with a Dior-beret-topped Isabelle Huppert. Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj, the latter fresh from the White House Correspondents’ dinner, were chatting up Aziz Ansari and Judd Apatow; Stephen Colbert made a dash past the crowd up a side colonnade.",
		"18" : "A drummer sounded the call for dinner, but with the highest-profile attendees (Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Madonna) still outside on the red carpet, the procession moved slowly. All the better opportunity for a few straggling fans whose tickets were cocktail-only to take in the sight of Roger Federer, the tennis champion and longtime favorite of Ms. Wintour’s, in a Gucci tuxedo whose jacket back was elaborately bedazzled with a rearing cobra. He was perfectly game to pose for photos. “I’m happy,” he said. “Someone is taking a photo of the back for a change.”"

		"1" : "Luis Olmo, who became the first Puerto Rican position player in the major leagues when he made his debut with the 1943 Brooklyn Dodgers, helping to create a path for the dozens of Puerto Rican ballplayers who have made a major impact on the game, died on Friday in Santurce, P.R. He was 97 and had been the oldest living former Dodger.",
		"2" : "His death was confirmed by a grandson, Yuri Perez.",
		"3" : "Olmo, who played mostly in the outfield, arrived at Ebbets Field a year after Hiram Bithorn, a right-handed pitcher, became the first Puerto Rican major leaguer when he joined the Chicago Cubs.",
		"4" : "Cubans had appeared in the majors before Bithorn and Olmo arrived. Whatever their nationality, all of the early Latino players possessed a qualification that ownership demanded: They were white.",
		"5" : "Latinos began making a significant impact in American baseball only after Jackie Robinson broke the modern major league color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers.",
		"6" : "By the 1950s, black Latino players, most notably the future Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente and Orlando Cepeda, along with Vic Power and Ruben Gomez, all Puerto Rican natives, and Minnie Minoso, a Cuban, had established themselves in the majors.",
		"7" : "Olmo, a native of Arecibo, on Puerto Rico’s northern shore, made his Dodgers debut on July 23, 1943, and batted .303 as a rookie.",
		"8" : "He was described by Tim Cohane in an October 1943 issue of The Sporting News as “a strongly built youngster who can run like a Western Conference halfback, throw like a DiMaggio and meet the ball solidly and with extra-base power.”",
		"9" : "Despite his promise, Olmo did not fare well in a non-negotiation over salary with the Dodgers’ general manager.",
		"10" : "“Before the end of the season, I asked Branch Rickey for a raise for the 1944 season,” Olmo recalled in Lou Hernandez’s oral history of 1950s Caribbean baseball, “Memories of Winter Ball” (2013). “Rickey called in his secretary and told her to get me an airplane ticket to go back home. I changed my mind about the raise.”",
		"11" : "Olmo, a right-handed batter, drove in 85 runs in 1944, although his average dropped to .258. He batted .313 the next season, drove in 110 runs, had a National League-leading 13 triples, hit 10 homers and stole 15 bases.",
		"12" : "The summer of 1945 would be the high point of his major league career.",
		"13" : "In spring 1946, Olmo was among some 20 major league players, a number of them Latinos, who signed with the newly formed Mexican League, which was offering salaries far in excess of their major league pay.",
		"14" : "The players were barred by Major League Baseball for five years for jumping to an outlaw league, but the suspensions were rescinded after three years.",
		"15" : "Olmo returned to the Dodgers in the middle of the 1949 season, hit .305 and homered in their World Series loss to the Yankees.",
		"16" : "But with Duke Snider playing center field and Carl Furillo in right, he was expendable. Rickey traded Olmo on Christmas Eve to the Boston Braves. They released him during the 1951 season, and he retired with a .281 career batting average.",
		"17" : "Luis Francisco Rodriguez Olmo was born on Aug. 11, 1919, one of the four sons of Jose Rodriguez, a carpenter, and his wife, Anna Olmo.",
		"18" : "He played high school baseball, then joined the Caguas team of Puerto Rico in 1938.

He arrived in Brooklyn after a half-season with the Dodgers’ Montreal Royals farm team.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "How do interior designers make the choices they do?",
		"2" : "That’s the question I ask every time I step into an artfully decorated room or look through shelter magazines in admiration. Why were those framed drawings arranged above that Art Deco table? Why were the floorboards in the loft apartment stained black? Why, out of thousands of sofas, go with a boxy seven-footer upholstered in deep green velvet?",
		"3" : "I never have a clue.",
		"4" : "Despite my love for interior design and architecture, I don’t understand space and composition, and lack the ability to put a room together with confidence. Decisions are made arbitrarily, then regretted.",
		"5" : "One of my favorite design books is “Jacques Grange: Interiors” by Pierre Passebon, which showcases the work of the renowned French decorator. Mr. Grange’s layered, bohemian rooms for clients like Yves Saint Laurent, filled with rare and beautiful objects, art and lots of chairs, are an ideal for me, and I must have studied the images a thousand times. But if the book is a kind of bible, it’s an inscrutable one, composed in a visual language I can’t translate.",
		"6" : "What I often wonder about decorators like Mr. Grange is whether they are following an established set of rules — about space, color, proportion, materials, and so on — and experimenting within a framework of dos and don’ts. If there are rules, then an amateur like me can learn them.",
		"7" : "Or is decorating a series of subjective decisions made by people with innate good taste — a make-it-up-as-you-go profession? In which case, I will never master it.",
		"8" : "To help me better understand, I called Bennett Leifer, a young, New York-based designer whose work has been featured in Elle Décor and House Beautiful.",
		"9" : "Although Mr. Leifer, 35, didn’t formally study design, he did serve a long apprenticeship in the field, working for Ralph Lauren in the brand’s store development, for the architect Robert A.M. Stern and for Juan Pablo Molyneux, the high-end residential decorator. When he felt he was “cooked enough,” Mr. Leifer said, he started his own interiors firm, in 2013.",
		"10" : "“For me, what I do is so emotional,” Mr. Leifer explained. “The right way to do things is what sets up a backdrop for how a client is going to live. It’s not, for me, about color theory.”",
		"11" : "But, he added, “There are rules you learn along the way. I learned a lot about proportions and dimensions.”",
		"12" : "In talking with Mr. Leifer, I realized what I really wanted was to see a room through a designer’s eyes. I wanted him to break down each aesthetic decision, and explain why he’d made it.",
		"13" : "Mr. Leifer was game, and we decided to deconstruct the living room of his Manhattan apartment, which was sufficiently stylish to be featured in Architectural Digest. I also asked him to view a space unfamiliar to him — the living room of my apartment in Brooklyn Heights, which is not exactly A.D. worthy. Indeed, if there were decorating rules, certainly I’d broken a few.",
		"14" : "Listening to Mr. Leifer explain his work and critique mine turned out to be the revelation I’d hoped for. Sometimes he taught me a rule I didn’t know, sometimes he operated on instinct, but the reasons were always clear and logical. Surprisingly, so many of Mr. Leifer’s decisions were not guided by beauty but common sense and functionality. For me, it was interior design demystified.",
		"15" : "Casement windows Mr. Leifer restored and refinished the architectural details — the windows, floors, fireplace and walls — and used them as the “envelope” that establishes the colors for his décor. “So it’s black, dark brown, white and neutral,” he said. “That was my main palette.”",
		"16" : "Ceiling beams Mr. Leifer followed the lines of the ceiling beams to divide the room into three rectangular areas. He could then address his various desired functions within each. The middle rectangle is centered by the fireplace, and forms the heart of the room.",
		"17" : "Couch, side table Mr. Leifer bought a sofa and occasional chair that are roughly the same cushion height, with backs and arms that are also within approximate height, because “you want the proportions of the furniture that go into a group to relate,” he said. He believes a sofa should be 7 to 9 feet (his is 7) because 10 is too large unless it’s for a media room and 6 or less feels like a secondary sofa.",
		"18" : "Television Where to put the TV is always a vexing issue. Mr. Leifer turned the room’s least prominent corner into a utilitarian space. “Just make this easy and functional and keep the beauty elsewhere,” he said.",
		"19" : "Bookcase Mr. Leifer arranged his bookcase by following two personal rules: He sorted the books according to size and put the less important books and storage binders on the lower shelves out of sight.",
		"20" : "Mantel As someone who buys what he likes and figures out where it will go later, I was struck by Mr. Leifer’s discipline. Every piece adhered to his established criteria, be it color, function, budget or, as with the objects on the mantel, his “very elementary 1 to 10 scale”: Don’t buy something unless it’s a 10. You reduce clutter that way, and surround yourself with things you truly love.",
		"21" : "This is my living room after Mr. Leifer rearranged things.",
		"22" : "Table Before, the table was shoved against the wall near the plants. “Things need to be put in places where they’re actually usable,” the designer said. “There should be clearance to walk around the table, to pull the chairs out.” He suggests a minimum 30 inches of clearance between furnishings.",
		"23" : "Painting As a general rule, art should be hung at “5-foot center” — meaning the center of the work is 60 inches off the floor, Mr. Leifer said, demonstrating by lowering a painting that I had placed too high. “Some people who are more sophisticated than I am break the rules,” he noted.",
		"24" : "Plants The houseplants had been divided around two windows. Mr. Leifer grouped them all together, both to create a layered effect and, more important, to visually balance the other “heavy” corner opposite with the bookshelves.",
		"25" : "Wiggle chair Mr. Leifer said this nook with shelves of records, a light and a Wiggle Side Chair by Frank Gehry was sending a mixed message: “Come sit here, turn on my lamp, look at my record collection. But actually, this is a sculpture, don’t sit on it.”",
		"26" : "Record collection Also, Mr. Leifer noted, the records mean a lot to me but had been pushed in a corner. He suggested making them a prominent part of the room, and offered this simple yet wise decorating advice: “You need to design around how you live.”"

		"1" : "As a choreographer, José Limón was full of emotion: Sterile formalism was never his thing. For Limón, the artist’s function was “to be the voice and conscience of his time.”",
		"2" : "Limón wrote those words in 1965, but his humanist approach lives on in his company, which this season presents its first performances under the artistic direction of Colin Connor, a former Limón dancer. He is faced with a challenge: How can a company hold on to its past while not seeming dated and dutiful? The season opener, unremarkably, had some bumps.",
		"3" : "Opening on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, the company unveiled vintage Limón dances alongside two contemporary works: One by Mr. Connor — “Corvidae,” a dark, dour piece inspired by ravens and crows — and one by Kate Weare, “Night Light.” Originally created for Juilliard dancers in 2014, “Night Light,” with its sentimental partnering and rows of dancers sweeping on and off the stage, remains a student work.",
		"4" : "But moments of the Limón dances, which included “Concerto Grosso” (1945), “The Exiles” (1950) and a particularly vibrant suite from “A Choreographic Offering” (1964), revealed sparks of vitality. At times — especially in “A Choreographic Offering,” which was staged and directed by the former Limón dancer Kurt Douglas — the dancers performed with a luscious spontaneity. Limón’s works can creep into a labored piousness; this was alive.",
		"5" : "So why conclude the program with “Night Light” instead of “A Choreographic Offering”? And why offer, on other programs, two renderings of “The Exiles,” Limón’s retelling of the story of Adam and Eve? On opening night, the music and costumes were original (Schoenberg, with unitards by Pauline Lawrence); on other programs, the dance will be set to a new score by Aleksandra Vrebalov, with costumes by Chris Hynds.",
		"6" : "This hardly inspires confidence — it’s as if the company couldn’t decide between modernizing itself and not alienating its most ardent fans. Staged and directed by Mr. Connor, “The Exiles” is an arduous, meaty duet, which on Tuesday was aided by the well-matched elegance of Kristen Foote and Mark Willis. They did their best to execute the curves and bends of the choreography, while evoking the biblical characters, but by the end, they resorted to layering extra meaning onto the movement instead of letting it just be.",
		"7" : "“The Exiles” is one of those dances that slip in and out of datedness. It ended on a poignant note as the pair, crossing the stage laboriously in low, grand pliés, faced each other, each with an arm stretched out to the side as they inched their way to the wing. Here, they seemed utterly displaced: as somber and as desolate as refugees."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "SPENCERTOWN, N.Y. — On the eve of his 90th birthday in 2013, Ellsworth Kelly told me that working in his studio in Columbia County was “as exciting for me as ever.”",
		"2" : "“I have had some physical challenges related to aging, though I accept it,” the painter said. “But it has given me an added surge for continuing to create new work.”",
		"3" : "Though suffering from emphysema in his last several years — a result of longtime exposure to turpentine fumes — Kelly was still remarkably productive and immersed in his lifelong investigation of form, color and plane. He died in his home here on Dec. 27, 2015, two days after he and Jack Shear, his partner of 32 years, hosted Jasper Johns and Terry Winters, among others, for Christmas. Kelly had 10 paintings on his studio walls completed that year, with a freshly gessoed panel ready to work on.",
		"4" : "These paintings, some reworkings of much earlier canvases, go on view for the first time on Friday in “Ellsworth Kelly: Last Paintings,” at the Matthew Marks Gallery on West 22nd Street in Chelsea. A companion show next door, “Ellsworth Kelly: Plant Drawings,” includes 25 images of flowers, fruit, vegetables and leaves dating from 1949 to 2008, most never before exhibited and often drawn without the pencil’s ever leaving the page.",
		"5" : "Last month, before the paintings were shipped to the gallery, Mr. Shear welcomed me to the expansive studio and offices here in Spencertown, from which he runs the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation. On one wall are side-by-side portraits of the two men taken by Robert Mapplethorpe in the 1980s after they met in Los Angeles, where Mr. Shear, three decades Kelly’s junior, worked as a photographer. Mr. Shear moved to Spencertown in 1984 in what the two men termed “an experiment,” which became a lasting marriage.",
		"6" : "In the studio, nary a paintbrush has been moved. A tall rolling library ladder remains in the corner, draped with Kelly’s paint-splattered work clothes. On a well-ordered desk, a legal pad topped by a ruler and a pencil sits near the small device with which the artist measured his oxygen level throughout the day. (He referred to the oxygen tanks he needed as his “tail.”)",
		"7" : "In the artist’s brilliantly illuminated studio hung a two-panel painting titled “White Over Black III,” a white vertical rectangle overlapping a slightly larger black one. “It has this doorlike quality to it,” said Mr. Shear, noting how the white shape perceptually “flips” between projecting forward and receding. “Ellsworth likes to play games with vision more than anything,” said Mr. Shear, who still speaks of his partner in the present tense.",
		"8" : "On another wall, a green rectangular panel hung beside a blue oval. The diptych recalls Kelly’s 1963 canvas “Green Blue Red.” By eliminating the red background, Kelly changed the dynamic and integrated the white wall as a compositional element.",
		"9" : "Mr. Marks, the gallerist, traced the source of both paintings to a 1950 photograph that Kelly took, “Trapeze Swings, Meschers,” showing a right-angled swing hanging in a jungle gym beside a curved swing. “It’s a huge leap to get from that” to the paintings, Mr. Marks said, “but he saw things in nature that inspired his work.”",
		"10" : "Kelly had been an avid bird-watcher since his boyhood, and Mr. Marks connected the artist’s recurring use of the arrow form with his early study of bird shapes in Audubon watercolors.",
		"11" : "Kelly developed his rigorous approach to abstraction as a young artist in 1948, pivoting away from the psychologically charged paintings of the Abstract Expressionists who dominated the New York scene. He went to Paris for six years and began isolating interesting shapes he found in plants, buildings, shadows and reflections — which he then blew up in scale and painted in flat, monochromatic hues.",
		"12" : "While artists, including Monet and Picasso, have often had a dramatic shift in their late work, Ann Temkin, the chief curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, was struck by how “remarkably true” Kelly remained to the vocabulary he had established seven decades earlier.",
		"13" : "“You might think, at this point, he would have exhausted these formats or colors or ideas, but the answer with these last paintings is a resounding no,” said Ms. Temkin, who was given a preview of the exhibition catalog.",
		"14" : "Mr. Shear pointed to the artist’s main work table, with a notebook open to thumbnail sketches of four joined-panel paintings. “He didn’t really struggle with painting much, but towards the end, he was really going back and forth on these paintings,” he said, showing the finished works in an adjacent room.",
		"15" : "One has a large white arrow overlapping the edges of a black rectangle and slicing it into five triangles.",
		"16" : "The sketches show that Kelly originally had the arrow completely contained within the border of a larger panel. “He didn’t think there was enough tension,” Mr. Shear said.",
		"17" : "James Rondeau, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago, said that with a “lesser artist, returning to one’s own past to revise it would represent the absence of creativity.” Previewing the new paintings in the catalog, he added, “With Ellsworth, it’s precisely the opposite.”",
		"18" : "Mr. Marks, who paid a work call to Spencertown six days before the artist died, said with affection, “He was just as tough as he had always been.”",
		"19" : "Kelly’s confidence was pivotal to his dealer’s career. In 1994, when Mr. Marks was trading his small drawings gallery on Madison Avenue for a huge space on West 22nd Street, naysayers questioned whether anyone would come over to 10th Avenue. “That’s what they said about Soho,” Kelly argued. “Do good shows; they’ll go there.”",
		"20" : "Eight hundred people came to Mr. Marks’s inaugural exhibition of Ellsworth Kelly paintings. The current two exhibitions, with works priced between $3 million and $5 million, bring the gallery’s tally to 19 solo shows of the painter’s work.",
		"21" : "Mr. Winters, 67, was one of many young art students at the time who felt Kelly’s influence in the way that he “rooted his abstraction in the real world.”",
		"22" : "He added that “the drive and the level of accomplishment in the last years is sort of remarkable.”",
		"23" : "Mr. Shear saw the struggle others didn’t. “These last paintings took more time to do because of his health,” he said. “In his last three months, Ellsworth started signing drawings from the ’50s and ’60s that he never signed.”",
		"24" : "It was a harbinger of his acceptance of the end. After Kelly had died, Mr. Marks said that his artist friends all told him the same thing: “You do know that is every artist’s hope — basically dying with a paintbrush in your hand.”"

For the Venice Biennale opening May 13, she has covered a dilapidated 50-foot brick wall in the Arsenale with an immensely colorful stacked sculpture in fiber, what she called “building a safety net in the chromatic zone.”",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "You might wonder how a critically acclaimed but relatively unknown singer-songwriter recruited Adele, Pearl Jam and Dolly Parton to cover her songs for a benefit album. But the biggest get on Brandi Carlile’s “Cover Stories,” made up of new renditions of the material on her 2007 album, “The Story,” comes from outside the music world: Barack Obama.",
		"2" : "The former president doesn’t sing on the album, from which all proceeds will benefit War Child UK, an organization dedicated to supporting children affected by conflict. But he did provide a foreword for the package (out Friday on Legacy Recordings), in which he writes that “Brandi Carlile tells stories that encourage us to see ourselves in one another” and that she “reminds us that, together, we can build for our children a more just, peaceful world.”",
		"3" : "“The Story” has been a slow-burn tale of success. Its songs have turned up in numerous television shows and commercials, and the title track has become something of a staple on singing competition shows like “The Voice”; this year, a decade after its release, the album was certified gold. (Ms. Carlile is currently on a small tour on which she is playing the album in its entirety, an anniversary celebration she described as “more of a party environment.”)",
		"4" : "On the phone from her home outside Seattle, Ms. Carlile, 35, said she was unsure why the record had had such staying power — “I’m as confused as you are!” — but had become aware that “people were singing it still, and it wasn’t going away, so it seemed like the biggest thing I had to throw at this.”",
		"5" : "Her War Child efforts come after spending a long time following the refugee crisis in Syria. Ms. Carlile explained that after she and her wife, Catherine, had their daughter in 2014, they wanted a new focus for the singer’s Looking Out Foundation, which was formed in 2007 to create awareness around social justice and poverty issues. Catherine had previously worked as Paul McCartney’s charity coordinator, and felt that War Child (which Mr. McCartney has supported for many years) was the most worthy organization in this space. Everyone involved in “Cover Stories,” from the studio engineers up to the publishing companies, has declined to take any payment, meaning that money will be directed to War Child from the very first copy sold.",
		"6" : "Initially, Ms. Carlile thought that she might rerecord some of the songs on “The Story,” and ask some of her friends and opening acts to contribute. She sent a note to Adele — who had cut the album’s “Hiding My Heart” as a bonus track on a limited-edition British version of Adele’s 2011 album, “21” — inquiring if she might include Adele’s recording. She also dropped a line to Ms. Parton, who responded within 24 hours, agreeing to record the song “The Story.”",
		"7" : "“It seemed unimaginable, unattainable,” Ms. Carlile said. “But when Dolly does something, it raises eyebrows, and it came at what seemed like a tipping point in our political paradigm.”",
		"8" : "Other artists at the nexus of indie rock and alternative country came on board: Jim James, from My Morning Jacket; the Avett Brothers; Indigo Girls. Chris Stapleton added guitar to Kris Kristofferson’s version of “Turpentine,” and Miranda Lambert sings with Anderson East on “Josephine.”",
		"9" : "For Ms. Carlile, a child of the Pacific Northwest, getting Pearl Jam involved was a special thrill; she called the band “sacred pillars, mythical creatures.” Its guitarist Mike McCready is her neighbor, and he persuaded the group to record a raging performance of “Again Today.”",
		"10" : "“It was a long shot in my mind, as it is a bit of a process for Pearl Jam to get together when we are off tour,” wrote Mr. McCready (who gave a shout-out to Ms. Carlile in his recent Rock & Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech) in an email.",
		"11" : "“It was Eddie’s idea to cover it in a Ramones style,” he said, referring to Eddie Vedder. Ms. Carlile called it a “total, stark reversal of the whole concept of the song.”",
		"12" : "As for President Obama’s involvement in “Cover Stories,” Ms. Carlile is close to the former White House photographer Pete Souza and, through him, she has communicated enough with Mr. Obama to consider him “a bit of a mentor from afar.” She approached him about the project last fall, after he had read a letter to the United Nations General Assembly written by a 6-year-old New York boy offering to open his home to Syrian refugee children.",
		"13" : "“This is not about politics,” Ms. Carlile said. “What we do with these kids is the greatest test of our generation and our humanity. We need a lot of new voices to come to the table on this issue. There’s a lot of different kinds of people on this album, and that’s what it’s going to take.”"

		"1" : "Three years ago, the Québécois conductor Bernard Labadie spent a month in a medically induced coma as he battled lymphoma. Since then, he has worked to regain his health and resume a career in which he is sought out for Baroque and Classical repertoire.",
		"2" : "His next chapter will unfold in New York: The Orchestra of St. Luke’s announced on Wednesday that Mr. Labadie would become its next principal conductor in the 2018-19 season, succeeding Pablo Heras-Casado, who will become conductor laureate. In a phone interview from Quebec, where he founded the chamber orchestra Les Violons du Roy, Mr. Labadie, 54, spoke about music, his ordeal and his plans for St. Luke’s. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.",
		"3" : "It’s welcome news to have you back leading an orchestra again. Can you tell me a little bit about your health crisis?",
		"4" : "Clearly I was supposed to go at 51. So I feel like I’ve been given a huge credit card with an unlimited line, and I’m just living on it right now. And this new challenge with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s — I almost literally think that this is just what the doctor ordered.",
		"5" : "You were in a medically induced coma for a month?",
		"6" : "It was for a full month, yes, and I lost about 50 percent of my muscle weight. So when I woke up, I had to relearn how to sit by the bed. Three months after the stem cell transplant, I stood up in the arms of my physiotherapist for five seconds for the first time.",
		"7" : "How did you first start re-engaging with music?",
		"8" : "Except for when I was in a medically induced coma, music was always, always at the heart of my existence. I never stopped thinking about music. When I came back to it, it felt very natural — but more urgent than ever, I would say.",
		"9" : "Have you resumed conducting standing up, or using the baton?",
		"10" : "Still no baton, and still sitting down. It might never change — for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with cancer. I just enjoy it now. While I was sick, I had plenty of time to reflect, and also to watch a lot of videos of me conducting. And quite frankly, I was not always happy with what I was seeing. It forced me to rethink my job and the role of the conductor. Being seated, I have the feeling that I’m more in the music, with the musicians. I’m not towering over them. I’m really first among peers.",
		"11" : "What is your vision for the Orchestra of St. Luke’s?",
		"12" : "They expressed a lot of interest in what I had built here in Québec City with my own orchestra, because their vision for the new principal conductor was to have someone who could dig deeper in the universe of performance practice with the ensemble. I will be working on late 17th-, 18th-, early-19th-century repertoire. One of my goals is to bring my own professional choir, La Chapelle de Québec, to collaborate with the group.",
		"13" : "The orchestra has been doing a lot of commissioning in recent years. Does this mean there will be less focus on new works?",
		"14" : "I don’t think so. They were very clear that they intend to remain associated with that part of their existence — it’s just that I won’t be the one in charge of that part. But the orchestra is absolutely not turning its back on its roots and its deep involvement in the musical life of New York City in terms of new music, in terms of education, in terms of outreach.",
		"15" : "You’re going to make your debut with them July 2 conducting Mozart at Caramoor. Are you nervous? Is it like having your first date after the marriage is arranged?",
		"16" : "No! No! It’s our first public date. We’ve cuddled a lot in private."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "“No Shape,” the fourth album by Perfume Genius, begins like the previous ones: with a lone piano and the vulnerable croon of Mike Hadreas. But as he sings “Rocking you to sleep, from the Otherside,” the heavens suddenly open up with a cathedral-size chord, shimmering percussion and choirlike vocal harmonies, a paradise of pop artifice. It’s the signal that Perfume Genius’s ambition and eccentricity are broader than ever, and a demonstration that the music will live up to both.",
		"2" : "Love and death, body and spirit, overload and austerity, propulsion and meditation, desire and renunciation, fear and strength, joy and melancholy, existence and oblivion all figure in the songs on “No Shape.” In interviews, Mr. Hadreas has spoken about growing up gay and isolated, getting bullied and beaten up. Perfume Genius’s recording career began in 2010 with sparse, candid songs, often with Mr. Hadreas accompanied only by his boyfriend, Alan Wyffels, on piano. With his 2014 album, “Too Bright,” produced by Adrian Utley of Portishead, Perfume Genius embraced broader possibilities of the studio while he juxtaposed confession and confrontation.",
		"3" : "“No Shape” pushes both words and music into stranger territory, as Perfume Genius grows brasher and more inward-looking at the same time. There are love songs, but they are often wary, pondering when attachment turns into self-annihilation; in “Run Me Through,” he sings about removing and tanning his own skin: “Wear me like a leather/Just for you.”",
		"4" : "The album was produced by Blake Mills, who has lately abetted sonic explorations by Alabama Shakes and John Legend. With Mr. Hadreas’s aching, androgynous voice at their center, the songs deploy cinematic orchestral arrangements, spooky electronics and instruments that can sound vividly natural or treated and surreal. Odd, lumpy electronic sputters rattle what could be smooth rhythm-and-blues in “Go Ahead.” As the lyrics to “Slip Away” mingle the joys of music and lust, the song gathers momentum from fierce drumming and brutally plucked pizzicato strings.",
		"5" : "There’s less exposition and more mystery in many of the lyrics. “Burn off every trace/I want to hover with no shape,” Perfume Genius sings in “Wreath,” in which the narrator could be a ghost or a soul awaiting reincarnation, contemplating what he’s left behind: “I’m moving just beyond the frame,” he sings. “I see a wreath upon the grave.” But the song sounds gleaming and jubilant, layered and polished like the studio extravaganzas of Fleetwood Mac in its “Tusk” era.",
		"6" : "Some songs hark back to the plush extroversion of 1960s and 1970s pop. “Sides,” written and sung with Natalie Mering (a.k.a. Weyes Blood), explores romance turning dysfunctional amid opulent strings; “It ain’t easy to love,” it concludes. “Just Like Love” hints at both Enya and girl-group grandeur as it urges victims of harassment, “They’re rough, smother them with velvet” and adds, “When it happens again/Baby hold on and stare them down.”",
		"7" : "Other songs are solitary, almost secretive. Hollowed-out electric piano chords create space around “Die 4 You,” a ballad about erotic asphyxiation: “Every breath I spend you are collecting.” An ultraslow ballad about closeness and intimacy, “Braid,” concludes with Mr. Hadreas’s voice braided into close harmonies, singing, “Every harm is lovingly washed away.” And “Every Night,” a song about awaiting an apparition — “Must be a way to look/Before it’s undone” — is cozy and creepy at the same time.",
		"8" : "The music seeks some lessons in the past, when pop songs about love often were full of happily-ever-after promises. But Perfume Genius is too self-conscious and too doubtful to sink into retro comforts. In the album’s final song, “Alan,” Perfume Genius admits to devoted love: “You need me, rest easy, I’m here,” he sings. But then he concludes, “How weird.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "You can blame or thank Plácido Domingo for bringing Franco Alfano’s “Cyrano de Bergerac” to New York. It was his advocacy for this rarely heard opera from 1936 — by a footnote-worthy composer otherwise best known for completing Puccini’s “Turandot” — that persuaded the Metropolitan Opera to first stage “Cyrano” in 2005. Now Francesca Zambello’s handsome production is back for a short run (three more performances, through May 13) led by the tenor Roberto Alagna and the soprano Jennifer Rowley.",
		"2" : "For most of the opening performance on Tuesday, I found myself faulting Mr. Domingo’s judgment: The music is an unappealing mix of syrupy textures and tart harmonies. But the brilliance of Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play survives intact in Henri Cain’s libretto, and the two leads poured so much heart and intelligence into their performances that I left grateful for the experience.",
		"3" : "It’s easy to see why a composer would be attracted to the story. Cyrano is an irresistibly complex hero, a swashbuckling poet-soldier who doesn’t dare to declare his love to the beautiful Roxane because he is ashamed of his enormous nose. When Roxane falls for the handsome but tongue-tied Christian, Cyrano becomes his ghostwriter. Only years after Christian’s death in battle, and moments before Cyrano himself succumbs to an assassin’s blow, does Roxane learn whose letters and verses had bewitched her.",
		"4" : "As in a great Woody Allen movie, there are equal parts comedy and tragedy in every scene and every character; Alfano’s biggest shortcoming is his inability to capture that bittersweet tension. Too often his music is hard-edged and heavy, even in a scene like the opening duel, in which Cyrano needles a puffed-up actor with his sword and verse. Perhaps the conductor, Marco Armiliato, could have done more to rein in these moments of verismo pomposity. Rostand’s play isn’t so much about brain versus brawn; it celebrates wit, sprezzatura and the art of improvisation. Mozart might have done wonders with it.",
		"5" : "Still, Mr. Alagna’s enthusiasm for the often demanding title role came through undimmed. Even encumbered by a giant prosthetic nose, he produced his characteristic virile tenor, his sound bright, taut and slightly metallic. His tone became dramatically warmer and more pliant in the scenes in which he woos Roxane.",
		"6" : "The role of Christian is scored for a second tenor, here Atalla Ayan, whose timbre is darker and more soft-grained than Mr. Alagna’s. But the score often adds bright orchestral colors to scenes featuring the two tenors, resulting in a crowded bandwidth. Among the secondary roles, the bass-baritone David Pittsinger stood out as Le Bret.",
		"7" : "For Ms. Rowley, this was a breakthrough. Originally an understudy for Patricia Racette, she took over when Ms. Racette pulled out in March, and on Tuesday, she sang with an even, radiant tone and effortless, chiffony top notes. The scene pitting her against the always excellent men’s chorus, here soldiers preparing for battle, might have called for more heft. But at the heartbreaking ending, when Roxane discovers too late Cyrano’s selfless devotion, Ms. Rowley sang with an intensity of expression and a subtly embittered sound that suggested a singer of enormous gift and promise."

		"6" : "But to assume the audience has to want to have a beer with Mr. Carlson to like “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is to misunderstand cable news and American politics.",
		"7" : "Mr. Carlson understands that politics today — as followed by cable-news addicts like the one in the White House — is attitudinal, not ideological. The reason to be for someone is who is against them. What matters more than policy is your side’s winning, and what matters more than your side’s winning is the other side’s losing.",
		"8" : "So the major product of much conservative news media, to quote a popular postelection souvenir mug, is liberal tears. And Mr. Carlson drinks them like a refreshing chablis.",
		"9" : "Like Mr. O’Reilly, Mr. Carlson does not seek to interview his subjects but to defeat them. His quarry often includes minor Democratic politicians, strident activists and equivocating academics who seem cast as walking stock photos of “radical lefties.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Carlson walks them through an Indiana Jones gantlet of spring-loaded traps. He shifts topics to imply hypocrisies: an argument about the Trump policy on sanctuary cities becomes one about the Obama policy on transgender bathroom use. He loves hypotheticals: “Why not burn their books?” he asks a professor who had argued that universities have the right to disinvite controversial speakers. He prods, pounces, guffaws and interrupts: “Please spare me the lecture.”",
		"11" : "The camera holds tight on his face to show every squint of bemusement, contempt and confusion. (His default face is that of a bear puzzling out how to get at a beehive.) A long “Ohhhhh” means he believes a guest has just let slip a secret agenda. “I agree with you!” means he does not agree at all.",
		"12" : "If you’re not simpatico with Mr. Carlson, you’d probably be crazy to do his show, though a December clash with him lifted the Teen Vogue columnist Lauren Duca to liberal celebrity. (He mocked her for writing about Ariana Grande, she called him a “hack,” and — summing up our cultural moment — you can find various YouTube clips claiming that one “destroyed” the other.)",
		"13" : "With friendlier guests, like Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, Mr. Carlson’s heart seems less in the sport. Unlike Sean Hannity, he does not spend much time cheering Mr. Trump, even on immigration restrictions, his most Trumpian position. Mr. Carlson is too prickly to be assertively for anyone.",
		"14" : "But against — that he can do. “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is a buffet of things for viewers to oppose: the federal courts, Bill Nye, the rest of the media, California, universities, California universities.",
		"15" : "One regular segment, “Campus Craziness,” moves Mr. Carlson to “remember when the left believed in free speech.” “Top This,” a sampler of political-correctness outrages, might as well be called, “Look at This Stupid Liberal.”",
		"16" : "The show is expert culture-trolling — another common thread with Mr. O’Reilly and other Fox hosts — and a testament to the unifying power of mutual enemies. Like many establishment conservatives, Mr. Carlson has solved the dilemma of how to be pro-Trump by being anti-anti-Trump.",
		"17" : "Where Mr. Carlson’s show pits him against the (left-leaning) world, the panelists on its follow-up, “The Five,” are their own source of fodder, and sometimes their own worst enemies.",
		"18" : "“The Five” began as a happy-hour gabfest at 5 p.m. Now it’s like “Talking Dead” to Mr. Carlson’s “The Walking Dead,” punchily chewing over much of the material that filled the hour before.",
		"19" : "This being Fox, the five-person panel includes one person to the left — Bob Beckel or Juan Williams — whose role is often to be pained at the latest example of the left’s going too far.",
		"20" : "The liveliest and most agitated voice on the show belongs to the libertarian Greg Gutfeld, who delivers every rant as if the maid who spun straw into gold just guessed his true name. (One of his recurring segments is “I Hate These People.”) The cancellation of an Ann Coulter speech at the University of California, Berkeley, he said, amounted to “Sharia law for snowflakes.”",
		"21" : "Where “Tucker Carlson Tonight” strikes sparks off its guests, the panelists have to generate their own. “The Five” often feels like the last hour of an office holiday party that will yield a chagrined memo from human resources.",
		"22" : "On April 25, the panelist Jesse Watters seemed to make a lewd double-entendre about Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, saying after she had appeared on a panel in Berlin, “I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone.”",
		"23" : "The next day, Mr. Watters announced he was going on a brief “vacation,” but he also insisted his comment had been misconstrued. Maybe! So, maybe, were the words of Mr. Gutfeld, during the last week in the show’s 9 p.m. old time slot, when he said, referring to the dress the co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle was wearing, “You are giving America a raise.”",
		"24" : "Or maybe the show is sending its audience the message that, whatever penance the parent channel is making publicly for its scandals, its air is still a place where guys can say what they’re really thinking."

		"1" : "Be honest: You did not have Jimmy Kimmel in your “Most Socially Resonant Late-Night Monologue of 2017” betting pool.",
		"2" : "Clearly he didn’t either. “I’m sorry,” he began his monologue Monday night. “I try not to get emotional.” But he was — his voice immediately caught in his throat — as for 13 minutes he laid out the story of how his newborn son, Billy, was born with heart defects and nearly died.",
		"3" : "Mr. Kimmel was not the first late-night wiseacre to give a speech about a heart and find his own. In 2000, David Letterman returned to the air after bypass surgery and paid a humane, spellbinding tribute to the professionals who saved him. In retrospect, it was the beginning of Mr. Letterman’s late-career phase, when he moved from prankster to raconteur.",
		"4" : "I can’t tell you if this is the start of something different for Mr. Kimmel. But it was something different to watch. First because Mr. Kimmel’s story was so raw, grateful and — but for the occasional wisecrack — sincere. Then because he turned from his own story to the current debate over who gets access to this kind of miraculous care, and how.",
		"5" : "Mr. Kimmel doesn’t try to get emotional. He also, generally, doesn’t try to get political. He unloaded on Donald J. Trump at the Oscars, but night by night he hasn’t bird-dogged politics like Stephen Colbert, or played catch-up on it like Jimmy Fallon.",
		"6" : "Mr. Kimmel has been late night’s stick-to-sports guy — or rather, he’s stuck to Matt Damon feuds and viral prank videos. Elsewhere — on Comedy Central, TBS, HBO — more and more TV comics have been feeding off the energy of political fights.",
		"7" : "But Mr. Kimmel’s monologue showed there’s still a power in hearing this kind of message from the sort of guy it’s not supposed to come from.",
		"8" : "Politics, for a lot of people, is something that recedes behind everyday life. You have your job, your kids, your health. Politics can be distant, theoretical noise, until it springs out at you — maybe through your job, your kids or your health.",
		"9" : "The story Mr. Kimmel told was about encountering a political issue the way nonpolitical people do — unexpectedly, through a situation no one would ever seek out.",
		"10" : "One danger of a speech like Mr. Kimmel’s is the limousine-liberal trap: Here’s this rich celebrity lecturing us. And inevitably some people will take it that way.",
		"11" : "But Mr. Kimmel’s speech made a point of just that difference. Yes, he is a rich celebrity. His family will go to fine hospitals, have access to attentive nurses and outstanding surgeons, get flowers from Mr. Damon.",
		"12" : "On the other hand, he made achingly plain, there are some things you can’t buy your way out of: the frailty of life, the randomness of nature, the strangling terror of a parent with a deathly ill baby.",
		"13" : "So his story said, I am different from you, and I am the same as you — and because of the ways that we are the same, there are some ways in which we should not conscionably let each other be different. “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,” he said. “I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, or something else, we all agree on that, right? I mean, we do.”",
		"14" : "Well, sort of. It didn’t stop the former Republican representative (and syndicated radio host) Joe Walsh from tweeting back:",
		"15" : "As I’m sure Mr. Kimmel knows, just beyond the things “we all agree on” are the things we all don’t — means, policy, priorities — which is where politics begin.",
		"16" : "The breathless declarations that Mr. Kimmel had killed the Republican health care plan might be premature. As of this writing, it looked as if it might yet pass the House, with at least cosmetic nods toward people with pre-existing conditions, but not the guarantees that Mr. Kimmel argued for.",
		"17" : "But Mr. Kimmel’s voice rang louder in the hubbub over health care than any politician’s or comedian’s, precisely because he’s not that guy who obsesses about politics. Many of us, after all, aren’t that guy, either — until life happens to us, and we are."

		"1" : "JERUSALEM — Dorit Rabinyan’s love story was selling very well despite, and maybe because of, the lovers: an Israeli woman and a Palestinian artist who meet in the frost of a New York winter not long after the Sept. 11 attacks. It was based on her real romance that she turned into a prize-winning novel in 2014.",
		"2" : "Then Ms. Rabinyan, a well-known writer here since her 20s, became a national cause. In late 2015, the Israeli Education Ministry announced it would pull the book, whose tentative English title at the time was “Borderlife,” from its approved list for high school teaching. The move came amid a larger debate about the right-wing government’s crackdown on opponents, from rights groups to disillusioned soldiers.",
		"3" : "“I had a woman spit on me!” she recalled. “She said, ‘You are even lower than the soil on the soldiers shoes!’”",
		"4" : "Her book sales then doubled. People bought multiple copies and posted photos of themselves holding the book in bookstores. Her book showed that the Israeli left may be comatose, but it is not quite dead.",
		"5" : "“All the Rivers,” the new English title of the book, was published last week in the United States by Random House, and Ms. Rabinyan, 44, seemed a little nervous. She wanted Americans to read the book for what she said it is — a story of a specific love and its boundaries — and not because of the free-speech controversy here or the backdrop of a conflict that will not heal, now 50 years since Israel took control of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.",
		"6" : "The book’s main character, Liat, a dutiful young Israeli translator, falls for Hilmi, a Palestinian painter. Liat must decide how far to take a love she knows her family and friends will disapprove of, seeing her as a traitor to her upbringing, her Jewishness.",
		"7" : "“She takes him out of the multitude and acknowledges his humanity, her humanity,” Ms. Rabinyan said. “He’s not the Palestinian people. He’s one person.”",
		"8" : "Still, the book is tightly woven around the conflict. “This is what we call ‘the situation.’” she said. “It’s like the climate. Another season of the year, a fifth one.”",
		"9" : "The book opens with Liat, who, like Ms. Rabinyan, is of Iranian Jewish descent, being questioned by terror investigators. To them, Liat looked Middle Eastern, not necessarily Jewish. Soon after, she meets Hilmi. He is from Hebron and Ramallah, the Palestinians’ de facto capital; she is from Tel Aviv, its own bubble of sea and secularism in Israel.",
		"10" : "Hilmi tells her three things about himself, all of which end up mattering: He can’t drive. He never shot a gun. He can’t swim, partly because the West Bank, unlike Israel, does not have the sea Liat loves so much. (The book is dedicated to Ms. Rabinyan’s former lover, the artist Hassan Hourani, who drowned in 2003. She wrote a poignant farewell to him a year later in The Guardian.)",
		"11" : "The romance intensifies quickly, though Liat is concerned from beginning to end, less about him, but that her relationship goes against all she was taught.",
		"12" : "“Cut this off quickly,” Liat tells herself after their first night together. “Decide with a heavy but determined heart that it’s better this way, better for both of us. And never see him again.”",
		"13" : "Needless to say, she does.",
		"14" : "“In New York they became more like each other, same land, same experiences,” Ms. Rabinyan said of her characters. “They went into this bubble.”",
		"15" : "The couple find that their similarities and differences are very complicated. Liat, a high-minded, educated woman of the left, sees the only solution as two states, fair but in the end separate. Hilmi thinks there is no dividing the two people on the same land. (This argument, of course, has only intensified.)",
		"16" : "The book is too finely drawn for easy symbolism, but at one point Liat sums up what nearly all Israelis have thought, knowingly or not, of their Palestinian neighbors — sometimes not so much antagonism as the wish it simply was not an endlessly prodding problem.",
		"17" : "“Only 10 minutes,” she scolds. “Just disappear from my life for 10 minutes.”",
		"18" : "The book is also very much of a place and time: People called each other primarily on landlines, without the distracting screens of smartphones. There was no Facebook, Twitter or Tinder. When Liat returns to Tel Aviv, she is disturbed that she has no photograph with Hilmi.",
		"19" : "“It seems impossible now,” Ms. Rabinyan said. “Everyone is taking selfies, couple selfies, selfies after sex. If you said ‘hashtag’ in 2002, people would have thought it was a breed of dog.”",
		"20" : "Ms. Rabinyan, in person both fierce and pleasant, found success at an early age. Her first novel, “Persian Brides,” based on two days of her Iranian grandmother’s memories, brought her acclaim at 22. Her wishes, she said, “came true even before I had the chance to ask for them.”",
		"21" : "Her second novel, “Strand of a Thousand Pearls,” also did well. In 2002, Ms. Rabinyan attended the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop, which she summed up, in quite American terms, as “awesome, quite beautiful, encouraging.”",
		"22" : "She worked on a third novel, which she shelved after six years. It took six more years to write “All the Rivers.”",
		"23" : "Though love stories between Israelis and Palestinians are not uncommon, this one drew the ire of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud government. Popular among younger readers, the book was recommended as high school reading, then suddenly and publicly pulled for possibly encouraging intermarriage.",
		"24" : "“Intimate relations, and certainly the available option of institutionalizing them by marriage and starting a family — even if that does not happen in the story — between Jews and non-Jews, are seen by large portions of society as a threat on the separate identities,” Dalia Fenig, an Education Ministry official, told Ynet a leading Israeli news site, in December 2015.",
		"25" : "The backlash came quickly, at a time when many of the nation’s leading, if leftist, literary idols — including Amos Oz, A. B. Yehoshua and David Grossman — were under attack by a right-wing group for being “moles in culture,” not sufficiently dedicated to the Israeli cause.",
		"26" : "The ministry backed off slightly, allowing some teachers to use the novel in classrooms. What Ms. Rabinyan found disturbed her: It was the students, amid the nation’s palpable drift to the right, who did not want to read the book, which had generally been popular.",
		"27" : "“Nowadays kids in Israel and in Palestine are so swept up with this wave of nationalism, exploitative of their instincts,” she said. “The kids themselves rejected the book. They said: ‘It’s a lefty book. I don’t want to read it.’”",
		"28" : "Prospects for peace look as bleak as ever, though President Trump has, to the surprise of some, been pushing early in his administration for what he called the “ultimate deal.” He is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, in the White House.",
		"29" : "Ms. Rabinyan said she would not give up hope, no matter how remote a deal might seem now (which, spoiler alert, are about as remote as the chances were that Liat could ever give in to Hilmi completely).",
		"30" : "“I refuse to let go of my instinct of being in contact with others’ pain,” she said. “This is turning your back. I refuse.”"

		"1" : "PRIESTDADDYBy Patricia Lockwood336 pages. Riverhead Books. $27.",
		"2" : "Pauline Kael despised the film version of “The Exorcist” — she thought it was a shallow, tendentious gross-out. But writing in The New Yorker in 1974, she did call it “the biggest recruiting poster the Catholic Church has had since the sunnier days of ‘Going My Way’ and ‘The Bells of St. Mary’s.’”",
		"3" : "Among those “The Exorcist” scared witless was Greg Lockwood, the father of the poet Patricia Lockwood. He was a Navy man in the mid-1970s. He first saw the movie while sealed in a nuclear submarine. There was not enough room for him to leap out of his own skin. A Lutheran, he experienced what he would call “the deepest conversion on record.”",
		"4" : "In her candy-colored new memoir, “Priestdaddy,” Patricia Lockwood describes her father’s conversion this way:",
		"5" : "“Put yourself in his place. You’re a drop of blood at the center of the ocean, which plays a tense soundtrack all night long, interspersed with bright blips of radar. Russians are trying to blow up capitalism and you’re surrounded by dolphins who know how to spy and the general atmosphere is one of cinematic suspense.",
		"6" : "“All of the sudden you look up at a screen and see a possessed 12-year-old with violent bedhead vomiting green chunks and backwards Latin. She’s so full of a demon that the only way to relieve her feelings is to have hate sex with a crucifix. You would convert too, I guarantee it.”",
		"7" : "These sentences are prime examples of Lockwood’s looping and elastic style. She injects whimsical imagery (spying dolphins, “violent bedhead”) into weightier reveries in a manner that can make your head, like the unlucky little girl’s in “The Exorcist,” perform what in ice skating they call a double axel.",
		"8" : "Lockwood’s prose is cute and dirty and innocent and experienced, Betty Boop in a pas de deux with David Sedaris. When her stuff is good, it is very good. Witness her poem “Rape Joke,” which put her on the map, and much of the other verse in her sexy and endearing bummer of a collection, “Motherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals” (2014).",
		"9" : "When her attention drifts, as it sometimes does in her memoir, the kookiness wears. Each sentence is its own quirky cameo appearance. Lockwood is a one-woman cupcake factory, and nothing is coming out of the kitchen unless it has sprinkles, curls, powdered sugar and, lastly, a filthy word piped onto the top.",
		"10" : "The good news about “Priestdaddy” is that it roars from the gate. Its first third is electric. It’s not just that Lockwood has fresh eyes and quick wits, but that in her father she’s lucked upon one of the great characters of this nonfiction decade.",
		"11" : "Greg Lockwood is no typical Catholic priest. He’s a big bear of a man, fond of guns, cream liqueurs, pork rinds and flatulence as a conversational gambit. When the mood strikes him, he pulls out his red guitar and begins to make an inchoate noise that his daughter likens to “a whole band dying in a plane crash in the year 1972.”",
		"12" : "The author is present on this planet (she calls herself “a human loophole”) thanks to the fact that when her father converted to Catholicism, he was already a married Lutheran minister. He received a dispensation from Rome to become that rarity, a married Catholic priest. During his daughter’s youth, he presided over churches in what she calls, in a biographical note, “all the worst cities of the Midwest.”",
		"13" : "Greg Lockwood comes off, in his daughter’s telling, as something like a right-wing, pulpit-thumping version of Ignatius Reilly, the antihero of John Kennedy Toole’s novel “A Confederacy of Dunces” (1980).",
		"14" : "Walker Percy described Ignatius as a “slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one.” That’s not a bad description of Greg.",
		"15" : "He listens to Rush Limbaugh while watching Bill O’Reilly. He consumes Arby’s Beef ’n Cheddar sandwiches the way other humans consume cashews. He strides around in his underwear. He thunders about “feminazis.”",
		"16" : "When his daughter gets a poem published in The New Yorker, he declares, bizarrely, that it was “part of The New Yorker’s mission to abolish age-of-consent laws.”",
		"17" : "Lockwood manages to make her father not only more complicated than he seems, but also oddly lovable in his lurching way. She writes sensitively about coming of age — as a woman, and as a poet — under the Joe Cocker-meets-John Goodman rainstorm of his persona.",
		"18" : "“When the patriarch of your family is a priest,” she writes, “it can be difficult to tell what is church and what is not.” Part of the story this book tells is of her gradual break from the church, her awareness that she is, as she puts it, “from the devil.”",
		"19" : "There is lovely writing in “Priestdaddy” about social class. There was no money for the author or her sister to attend college. They tended to live near polluted rivers.",
		"20" : "“A beautiful backdrop is an aesthetic luxury, same as shelves of books and music lessons and trips to museums on weekends,” she writes. “It is green, green money to roll in.” In its scrutiny of life outside America’s elite culture, this book can be read as a flyway companion volume to J. D. Vance’s best seller “Hillbilly Elegy” (2016).",
		"21" : "Other good stories are told in “Priestdaddy,” including the author’s decision to run away from home at 19 with a man she’d met on the internet. (They were discussing poetry.) When he got sick and they ran out of money, they moved back in with Patricia’s parents. They remain married.",
		"22" : "By its midpoint, however, “Priestdaddy” has begun to drift. Greg Lockwood mostly falls out of the story. The author no longer seems sure where her book is heading. Some of the scenes that feature the author’s combative mother have a tinny, cartoonish ring. This memoir limps home.",
		"23" : "Serious incidents (a rape, a suicide attempt) flicker past too quickly. There’s a sense the author is not making things hard enough for herself, or for us. A lot is being swept under a colorful rug.",
		"24" : "“Priestdaddy” is consistently alive with feeling, however, and I suspect it may mean a lot to many people, especially the lapsed Catholics among us. It is, for sure, like no book I have read. The Bible tells us to forgive our enemies, not our families."

		"1" : "Harvard Law School, expanding a pilot program for Harvard undergraduates, said Wednesday that it would allow juniors accepted from any college to defer admission as long as they finish college and spend at least two years working, studying or pursuing research or fellowships.",
		"2" : "The expanded program will be open to students applying starting this fall. The existing pilot program, for Harvard juniors, was started in 2014 to encourage students to gain work experience before entering law school and to encourage those studying science, technology, engineering or math to pursue the legal profession.",
		"3" : "In March, Harvard Law School took a separate step to shake up the traditions of law school admissions by agreeing to allow applicants to be accepted on the strength of their scores on the graduate record examination, or GRE, beginning with students entering in fall 2018. Only one other law school, the University of Arizona’s James E. Rogers College of Law, had made a similar move.",
		"4" : "Law schools around the country, most of which are facing lower enrollment, have debated how to attract a more diverse applicant pool. As legal employment has wobbled, many potential students have shied away from law school and the six-figure debt it typically requires.",
		"5" : "Allowing applicants to use the GRE as an alternative to the traditional Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT, is expected to prompt more students, both domestic and international, to consider law school.",
		"6" : "Harvard Law’s latest step allows college graduates to broaden their experience while knowing they have a secure law school berth, said Jessica L. Soban, the school’s associate dean for admissions and strategic initiatives.",
		"7" : "“This allows students to go and do something they love, and not to feel they have to build their résumé,” Ms. Soban said. “One of the students, for example, has a martial arts background and now is working in Hollywood as a stunt double. She supports herself working as a paralegal, but this program gives her flexibility to pursue something she loves.”",
		"8" : "So far, Ms. Soban said, other students accepted under the pilot program have been working in voting rights initiatives, think tanks and start-ups. The admissions deferral generally lasts two years but can be extended on a case-by-case basis, she said.",
		"9" : "In recent years, Harvard Law has emphasized work experience when it accepts students. The percentage of students enrolling directly from undergraduate programs has dropped to 20 percent, from 40 percent eight years ago.",
		"10" : "“By offering admission to the most promising college juniors, we can encourage them to pursue important and fulfilling experiences without concerns about effects on a later application to law school,” Martha Minow, the law school’s dean, said in a statement."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "With its creditors at its heels and its coffers depleted, Puerto Rico sought what is essentially bankruptcy relief in federal court on Wednesday, the first time in history that an American state or territory had taken the extraordinary measure.",
		"2" : "The action sent Puerto Rico, whose approximately $123 billion in debt and pension obligations far exceeds the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by Detroit in 2013, to uncharted ground.",
		"3" : "While the court proceedings could eventually make the island solvent for the first time in decades, the more immediate repercussions will likely be grim: Government workers will forgo pension money, public health and infrastructure projects will go wanting, and the “brain drain” the island has been suffering as professionals move to the mainland could intensify.",
		"4" : "Puerto Rico is “unable to provide its citizens effective services” because of the crushing weight of its debt, according to a filing on Wednesday by the federal board that has supervised the island’s financial affairs since last year.",
		"5" : "The total includes about $74 billion in bond debt and $49 million in unfunded pension obligations.",
		"6" : "While many of Puerto Rico’s circumstances are unique, its case is also a warning sign for many American states and municipalities — such as Illinois and Philadelphia — that are facing some of the same strains, including rising pension costs, crumbling infrastructure, departing taxpayers and credit downgrades that make it more expensive to raise money. Historically, Puerto Rico was barred from declaring bankruptcy. In the end, however, financial reality trumped the statutes, and Congress enacted a law last year allowing bankruptcy-like proceedings.",
		"7" : "Puerto Rico has been in a painful recession since 2006, and previous governments dug it deeper into debt by borrowing to pay operating expenses, year after year. For the last two years, officials have been seeking assistance from Washington, testifying before stern congressional committees and even making fast-track oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court.",
		"8" : "At the same time, Puerto Rico’s efforts to coax its creditors to agree to concessions have gone nowhere. Now the coming court proceedings will give Puerto Rico extraordinary powers to impose losses on holdout creditors unilaterally.",
		"9" : "The island’s many creditors — whose lawsuits filed against Puerto Rico on Tuesday prompted the island’s request for court relief on Wednesday — are likely to receive far less of their money back than they want. Their predicament may turn out to be a cautionary tale for bond holders of other troubled states and cities. Puerto Rico’s case could show public workers and retirees that seemingly inviolate pension systems can be changed, too.",
		"10" : "The next step is for the Supreme Court — specifically, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. — to designate a bankruptcy judge to handle the case.",
		"11" : "The island’s lawyers may view some bankruptcy courts as more likely to be favorable to them than others. Some creditors fear Puerto Rico will seek to have the case handled in the Southern District of New York.",
		"12" : "Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, issued a statement Wednesday aiming to offer some reassurance, even as he sought the federal court’s protection. “We remain committed to holding good-faith negotiations to reach agreements with our creditors,” he said, adding that he hoped the court proceedings would “accelerate the process.” He appeared to be referring to the extraordinary power Puerto Rico will now have in court to unilaterally impose big losses on creditors.",
		"13" : "Some of those creditors are furious.",
		"14" : "“The Commonwealth’s proposal is not a credible starting point for negotiations,” Andrew Rosenberg of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, an adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of Puerto Rico General Obligation Bondholders, said in a statement. He said that moving the proceedings to bankruptcy court would put the situation in “free-fall.”",
		"15" : "The creditors got a shock this year when Mr. Rosselló issued a five-year fiscal plan that allowed only about $800 million a year to pay principal and interest on Puerto Rico’s bond debt, far less than the roughly $3.5 billion a year it would cost to make those payments on time. The prospect of losses on that scale prompted some creditors to argue that most of the $800 million was rightfully theirs.",
		"16" : "“That things are starting out in such a highly adversarial way strongly suggests this will be a long and contentious journey for Puerto Rico,” said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics who closely tracks activity in the municipal bond market.",
		"17" : "Puerto Rico’s case will be the first ever heard under a federal law for insolvent territories, called Promesa, which was enacted last summer; the Obama administration had warned that a “humanitarian crisis” would ensue if Puerto Rico were not given extraordinary powers to abrogate debt. There is no existing body of court precedent for Promesa, but the island’s creditors — who range from hedge fund managers to mom-and-pop investors — are bracing for a titanic battle.",
		"18" : "Despite the depth of the island’s troubles, many Republicans in Congress have opposed debt relief, saying that the island has long received big federal subsidies for its health system, public housing and other works. They said Puerto Rico should explain what it had done with that money before it got any more help.",
		"19" : "Last week President Trump suddenly added fuel to those fires, saying on Twitter that there should be no “bailout” for Puerto Rico.",
		"20" : "On the island, Washington is not seen as a helper but as an unsympathetic colonial overlord. The step toward bankruptcy-like proceedings, under a federal judge, intensified complaints that Puerto Rico has lost all control of its own future.",
		"21" : "But at the same time, some Puerto Ricans say quietly that if the court proceedings really do allow their government to cancel debt, their island may finally get the fresh start it needs.",
		"22" : "The coming court proceedings will not be formally called a bankruptcy, since Puerto Rico remains legally barred from using Chapter 9, the bankruptcy route normally taken by insolvent local governments. Instead, Mr. Rosselló petitioned for relief under Title III of the Promesa law, which contains certain Chapter 9 bankruptcy provisions but also recognizes that, unlike the cities and counties that use Chapter 9, Puerto Rico is not part of any state and must in some ways be treated as a sovereign.",
		"23" : "Bankruptcy lawyers and public finance experts are watching Puerto Rico’s case closely, to see if it shows a path that financially distressed states like Illinois might also one day take. States, like United States territories, currently cannot declare bankruptcy.",
		"24" : "The only creditors who reached an agreement with Puerto Rico were the holders of a class of bonds, about $9 billion worth, that were sold to raise money for the island’s public power utility. Those creditors gave concessions that the governor pointed to Wednesday as a good example for other creditors to follow.",
		"25" : "The governor’s fiscal plan also calls for shifting all current government workers from pensions into 401(k)-style retirement plans. Current retirees will continue to receive their traditional monthly pensions, but the amounts are to be reduced by about 10 percent on average.",
		"26" : "The governor’s hand was forced by the expiration on Monday, at midnight, of a court stay that had been keeping Puerto Rico’s creditors from suing. On Tuesday, as soon as the stay expired, bondholder groups and at least one bond insurer sued. Wednesday’s actions by the governor and the federal supervisory board effectively blocked the lawsuits from proceeding."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The timing could not be more fortunate for Sinclair Broadcast Group: a Republican president is in the White House, his regulators have just eased rules on owning television stations and the dominant name in conservative media is reeling from a sexual harassment scandal.",
		"2" : "But as Sinclair tries to expand by buying even more local television stations, it has locked horns with that other broadcast giant known for its political bent, 21st Century Fox.",
		"3" : "Now the battle for a bigger audience is on, as Sinclair and Fox each look to broaden their reach in the Trump era.",
		"4" : "Sinclair, which has little name recognition but beams local television stations into a quarter of American homes, covers plenty of standard local news, including fires, shootings and traffic. But it has also used its 173 television stations to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda since the presidency of George W. Bush.",
		"5" : "Fox, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, has long dominated conservative political discussion with its Fox News cable channel. But Fox News is in disarray after several scandals. In the last weeks alone, Fox News lost its biggest star, Bill O’Reilly, and one of its most senior executives, Bill Shine.",
		"6" : "With Fox News on the ropes, Sinclair, already the largest owner of local television stations, is looking to expand. Until last week it appeared to be closing in on acquiring Tribune Media, the second-largest owner of such stations. If completed, the deal would expand Sinclair’s footprint from mostly smaller markets to some of the country’s largest cities, including Chicago and New York.",
		"7" : "Then Fox stepped in. Working with the private equity firm Blackstone, Fox is considering its own offer for Tribune, a move intended to thwart Sinclair’s expansion plans and prevent it from amassing too many local Fox affiliates, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Bids for Tribune are due Thursday.",
		"8" : "Sinclair is eager to broaden its reach. Last month, the company hired Boris Epshteyn, a former spokesman for President Trump, as its chief political analyst and on-air commentator. And the company has been emboldened by the Trump administration’s easing of rules that had stymied its expansion.",
		"9" : "“Sinclair was growing and building before there was this Fox controversy,” said Armstrong Williams, owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, the largest African-American-owned station group, which has two affiliates that have joint-operating agreements with Sinclair. “It was leveraging itself and looking for acquisitions.”",
		"10" : "Representatives for Sinclair and Fox declined to comment for this article.",
		"11" : "Founded in 1971 by Julian Sinclair Smith, an electrical engineer who understood the growing importance of broadcast television, Sinclair has expanded from one station serving Baltimore to 173 stations and 81 markets across the country.",
		"12" : "Much of that growth has come under the helm of Mr. Smith’s son David, Sinclair’s longtime chairman. Under the younger Mr. Smith, one of four brothers who together control the broadcaster’s voting stock, Sinclair has spent more than $7 billion since the mid-1990s on acquisitions, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence.",
		"13" : "“We’re forever expanding — like the universe,” Mr. Smith told The Baltimore Sun in 1995.",
		"14" : "It also operates stations owned by affiliates, some of which are majority owned by the Smith family, pushing up against Federal Communications Commission boundaries on station ownership in individual markets.",
		"15" : "In 2009, burdened by nearly $1.3 billion of debt and the recession, Sinclair warned that it might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. But today the company has a market value of nearly $3.4 billion and has expanded into original content and sports, even acquiring the Tennis Channel.",
		"16" : "Along the way, Mr. Smith and his brothers have become active in politics. Some of their giving has been to Democrats, mostly for state and local races in Maryland. But a vast majority of their money has been funneled to Republican causes, including the Republican National Committee and a Mitt Romney fund-raising committee in 2012, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.",
		"17" : "In the last election cycle, the brothers donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican causes, including at least $6,000 from Frederick Smith to a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Trump and $20,000 from David Smith to the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
		"18" : "Despite Sinclair’s expansion in the last two decades, the nature of its holdings — a vast array of stations spread across markets and network affiliations — has meant that the company has never achieved the name recognition, or clout, of national broadcasters.",
		"19" : "Still, critics say Sinclair’s programming makes its political bent abundantly clear.",
		"20" : "While much of the station’s local news broadcasts are filled with local news, Sinclair also provides commentary and syndicated reports from its Washington bureau that have generally taken stances critical of Democrats and laudatory of Republicans.",
		"21" : "Mark Hyman, a onetime Sinclair executive, has a twice-weekly segment on dozens of the group’s stations, promising to take viewers “behind the headlines.” What they find there are reliably conservative arguments on hotly contested political issues like voter identification laws, the Export-Import Bank and overhauling the Internal Revenue Service.",
		"22" : "In the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Sinclair instructed anchors to read statements supporting Mr. Bush and his administration’s efforts to fight terrorism, The Baltimore Sun and others reported at the time.",
		"23" : "Before the 2004 presidential election, Sinclair drew sharp criticism, including from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for its refusal  to broadcast an episode of “Nightline” devoted to reciting the names of every member of the military killed in action in Iraq. The company, which sent Mr. Hyman and one of its reporters to Iraq earlier in the year to find positive stories that were not being told, said the broadcast amounted to an antiwar statement, The New York Times reported.",
		"24" : "Then, just days before the election, Sinclair aired parts of a documentary critical of the anti-Vietnam War activities of John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. The company had originally planned to air the documentary in full, The Times reported, but pressure from advertisers and shareholders led it to run only excerpts during a program on the election.",
		"25" : "More recently, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and now a senior adviser in the White House, said at a meeting with business executives that the Trump campaign had reached an agreement with Sinclair to give more access to Mr. Trump and the campaign under the condition that the interviews be broadcast without commentary on the company’s affiliates, according to two people who had attended the meeting but were not authorized to discuss it. Taped in Sinclair’s Washington bureau, the interviews with Mr. Trump were broadcast across several swing states.",
		"26" : "Sinclair has disputed reports that it engaged in any unusual arrangements with the Trump campaign, saying in a statement that it offered no deals on tone or subject matter and that it also approached Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign.",
		"27" : "Still, questions about the ties between Sinclair and Mr. Trump have continued since Election Day.",
		"28" : "In February, at one of his first news conferences as president, Mr. Trump granted the first of two questions to Scott Thuman, a reporter for Sinclair’s Washington ABC affiliate, WJLA, a rare distinction for a local broadcast affiliate.",
		"29" : "When Mr. Epshteyn, one of Mr. Trump’s most visible on-air defenders during the campaign, was looking for a place to land last month after leaving a brief stint in the White House, he signed a deal with Sinclair.",
		"30" : "“They have cobbled together this sort of old media infrastructure but have been so aggressive in their concentration and consolidation that it actually gives them a huge reach,” said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, a consumer advocacy group. “And there is no question they are using this huge reach, especially in a lot of battleground states, to really push news with a Republican slant.”",
		"31" : "Acquiring Tribune could further extend Sinclair’s influence, a potential expansion only recently made possible by the Trump administration.",
		"32" : "Last month, after lobbying from media companies, the F.C.C. reinstated what is known as the “UHF discount.” While broadcasters are not permitted to cover more than 39 percent of American households, the discount lets companies exclude stations operating on ultrahigh frequencies from their calculations of station ownership. That move gives Sinclair plenty of breathing room to buy more stations.",
		"33" : "Pursuing Tribune makes sense for Sinclair beyond politics. Becoming even bigger would allow Sinclair to push for higher fees from cable operators that retransmit its channels, while helping it fight similar fee demands from content providers, including Fox.",
		"34" : "In particular, buying Tribune would make Sinclair the biggest owner of Fox affiliates by far, giving it more leverage over the Murdochs.",
		"35" : "But Tim Graham, the director of media analysis at the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group, rejected the idea that Fox was under any imminent threat, from Sinclair or other competitors.",
		"36" : "“You can talk a big game about Fox News on the ropes, but it’s still Muhammad Ali,” Mr. Graham said. “It’s still the champion, and everyone else is much smaller.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — A few pieces of disappointing economic news in recent weeks have not shaken the Federal Reserve’s confidence that the economy is in good health.",
		"2" : "The Fed, as expected, did not raise rates on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. But it remains likely to raise rates in the coming months.",
		"3" : "• The Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate in a range from 0.75 percent to 1 percent.",
		"4" : "• Officials are not worried about the slow pace of growth during the first three months of the year. The Fed said the slowdown was “likely to be transitory,” meaning it expects a rebound.",
		"5" : "• The Fed remains on course to raise rates at least two more times this year. Investors expect an increase at the Fed’s next meeting, on June 13 and 14.",
		"6" : "The government estimates that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and prices continue to rise more slowly than Fed officials would prefer.",
		"7" : "But the Fed, in a statement issued Wednesday after the meeting of its committee, said the economy’s engine was still looking good, even if the car was moving a little slowly.",
		"8" : "Consumer spending, the bulk of economic activity, slowed in recent months, but the Fed’s statement said “the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remain solid.”",
		"9" : "So, too, for the broader economy. The Fed did not explain why it thought growth had slowed in the first quarter but said it continued to expect the economy would expand at a moderate pace.",
		"10" : "The statement was backed by a unanimous vote of the Fed’s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee.",
		"11" : "Internal debates have been subdued in recent months; most Fed officials are in broad agreement on the economic outlook and the proper course of monetary policy.",
		"12" : "The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in December and again in March. Many investors are anticipating another rate increase at the committee’s meeting in June.",
		"13" : "The steady decline of unemployment is the primary reason the Fed is on the move. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in March, the lowest level since 2007. (The government is set to release the April jobs report on Friday.)",
		"14" : "Most Fed officials have concluded that unemployment has returned to a normal level, and continued job growth will put upward pressure on inflation. But the Fed’s benchmark rate remains at a level that supports growth by encouraging borrowing and risk taking.",
		"15" : "Accordingly, the Fed wants to raise interest rates by the end of the year to a level that does not encourage or discourage growth.",
		"16" : "Fed officials have also discussed the details and timing of ending a related stimulus program, the Fed’s vast investments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed has indicated it could begin to reduce those holdings by the end of the year.",
		"17" : "There are, however, some reasons for hesitation. Despite the Fed’s fears of future inflation, actual inflation remains stubbornly sluggish. The Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures, the Commerce Department’s index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in March. The Fed would like prices to rise at an annual pace of 2 percent.",
		"18" : "The Fed is less concerned about the slow pace of economic growth in the first quarter, perhaps because there is evidence the government has systematically underestimated first-quarter growth in recent years. Growth over the last 12 months has remained around 2 percent, the mediocre but steady pace the economy has maintained in recent years.",
		"19" : "Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, said recently that the combination of rapid job growth and slow economic growth was “a big problem.” The slow growth appears to reflect the slow pace of improvement in the productivity of the average American worker.",
		"20" : "That, however, is a problem the Fed cannot solve by holding down rates.",
		"21" : "The Fed’s statement made little impression on financial markets. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.13 percent on the day, closing at 2,388.13. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.32 percent, from 2.29 percent. Investors also modestly increased their assessment of the chances that the Fed will raise rates in June — to 70 percent, from about 67 percent.",
		"22" : "Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, noted the Fed’s steady optimism, saying: “The postmeeting statement acknowledged the recent disappointments in growth and inflation but chose to view those developments in a favorable light. This glass-half-full statement leaves the door wide open to a June hike, provided, of course, that the recent data letdowns are indeed transitory.”",
		"23" : "Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the Fed’s confidence in the face of disappointment was a recent shift.",
		"24" : "“In the past, a soft patch in the data or a shift in market sentiment caused the Fed to alter course,” he said, adding, “The new Fed seems driven to lead and, at least for the moment, to be determined to follow its chosen path.”"

		"1" : "The New York Times Company reported substantial growth in its digital business on Wednesday, as new subscriptions helped drive gains in circulation and digital advertising revenue increased.",
		"2" : "But the company continues to face stiff headwinds on the print side. Print advertising revenue fell 18 percent, driving a 7 percent decline in total advertising revenue for the quarter.",
		"3" : "The company said that its digital advertising revenue rose 19 percent, to $50 million, in the first quarter, which ended in late March. It also added 308,000 net digital-only news subscriptions — the most of any quarter in its history — helping to propel an 11 percent increase in circulation revenue.",
		"4" : "The Times counted nearly 2 million digital-only subscriptions for its news products; including subscriptions to its crossword product, it has 2.2 million total digital-only subscriptions.",
		"5" : "Over all, the company reported total revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016. Its net income was about $13 million, compared with a net loss of roughly $14 million in the same period a year ago.",
		"6" : "“Print advertising remained tough,” Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “But it is a testimony to just how far our business has already transitioned towards digital that this steep decline did not stop us from growing our total revenue significantly in the quarter.”",
		"7" : "He added, “We are now in rapid transition from a celebrated past as a great American newspaper to a future of even greater potential as a subscription-first, mobile-first news provider for thoughtful audiences everywhere.”",
		"8" : "He attributed the strong growth in digital advertising revenue largely to the company’s focus on mobile, branded content and marketing and creative services.",
		"9" : "Still, these are difficult times for all print publishers. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, has repeatedly said the newsroom will have to be smaller, and employees are anxiously awaiting staff reductions that have been looming for months. The company is also in the midst of consolidating its staff onto fewer floors at its Midtown Manhattan headquarters, and signs of construction around the building have heightened the sense of instability.",
		"10" : "Mr. Thompson did not directly address buyouts or layoffs on the earnings call, saying only that Mr. Baquet had “made it clear that our newsroom needs to adapt and develop if we’re to seize the opportunity in front of us.” He said more information on changes in the newsroom would come “over the course of the present quarter.”",
		"11" : "Operating costs grew about 5 percent in the quarter, to $367 million, from $352 million in the first quarter last year. Adjusted operating costs increased to $346 million, from $328 million, which the company attributed to higher marketing costs and costs from acquired companies. The company introduced a brand campaign this quarter, “The Truth Is Hard,” which included a commercial during the broadcast of the Academy Awards. “It struck a chord not just in America, but around the world,” Mr. Thompson said about the advertising campaign. “Even the president of the United States was kind enough to draw attention to it.”",
		"12" : "Operating profit rose to $29 million in the quarter, from $28 million the previous year. Adjusted operating profit increased slightly to $53 million, from $52 million in the first quarter last year.",
		"13" : "There were other positive signs for the company. Digital advertising revenue represented 38 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue, compared with 30 percent in the first quarter last year. Circulation revenue from digital-only news subscriptions increased 40 percent, to $73 million.",
		"14" : "The company, however, expects second-quarter growth in the number of digital-only news subscriptions to slow compared with the previous two quarters as the effects of the so-called Trump bump — subscriptions spurred by coverage of President Trump, and his attacks on the paper — begin to wear off."

She also owns a bed-and-breakfast for dogs — Rivertown Bed and Biscuit in Conway, S.C. — and enters four to six competitions a year, she said.",
		"23" : "Ms. Oliver was working on a 1980s-themed design for her dog, including depictions of the movie alien E.T. and the television character Alf, as well as Strawberry Shortcake and a Care Bear. The E.T. image had a Christmas tree light illuminating his heart and his index finger — the one he used to point to the sky when he wanted to “phone home.”",

		"26" : "The $1,500 top prize (and a trophy and ribbon) went to another past winner, Angela Kumpe, for her homage to Rocky Mountain National Park. The poodle’s fur was molded and sculpted into a mountain lion, an elk and a bighorn sheep.",
		"27" : "Ms. Kumpe, a hunting enthusiast from Little Rock, Ark., who owns a salon called Angela’s Grooming, said the dye work alone took six to eight hours, doing it in sections and one leg at a time so the dog didn’t have to sit around too long at any one spell.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The electric-car maker Tesla said on Wednesday that its losses had widened in the first quarter, but that sales and revenues had grown rapidly as the company prepared for the critical launch of a mass-market model.",
		"2" : "The company said it lost $397 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $282 million in the same period a year earlier.",
		"3" : "But the automaker emphasized that production had increased by about 65 percent from last year’s first quarter, to 25,000 vehicles, and that revenue had more than doubled, to $2.7 billion. (The figure includes revenue from SolarCity, the solar-panel maker that Tesla merged with last year; automotive revenue alone was $2.3 billion.)",
		"4" : "The gains on the production side are being watched closely by investors and analysts who are seeking evidence that Tesla can meet its plans to begin manufacturing the Model 3, its first mass-market offering, this summer.",
		"5" : "“Model 3 development is nearly complete, as we approach the start of production,” Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said in a quarterly update posted on the company’s website.",
		"6" : "Investor bullishness about Tesla has been growing. Last month, its rising stock price pushed its market capitalization past those of General Motors and Ford Motor, indicating sky-high hopes for the company’s prospects in the hypercompetitive auto industry.",
		"7" : "Tesla shares were down 2.4 percent, to $303.50, in extended trading after the earnings announcement and Mr. Musk’s conference call with analysts; they remain almost 70 percent above where they were five months ago.",
		"8" : "Analysts are hoping that Mr. Musk will focus more on incremental improvements in sales, production schedules and earnings than on long-term, big-picture goals geared toward promoting clean energy.",
		"9" : "Mr. Musk has pledged to begin producing the Model 3 this summer at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota and General Motors.",
		"10" : "The Model 3 — a compact, electric car that is expected to sell for about $35,000 — is considered Tesla’s pivotal product.",
		"11" : "The company has built intense loyalty and demand for its two luxury offerings, the Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle. Both cost more than $90,000 with options, and their appeal is limited to a small number of wealthy customers.",
		"12" : "The introduction of the Model 3, however, puts Tesla in the mainstream of the automotive market. And Mr. Musk has created high expectations not only for the car’s performance and quality, but for its widespread availability.",
		"13" : "In the conference call with analysts, Mr. Musk said the company was moving quickly to further automate its assembly plant to include Model 3 production, and was hoping to build 5,000 vehicles a week by sometime this year.",
		"14" : "“Model 3 will be roughly comparable to the best high-volume vehicle production lines in the world,” he said.",
		"15" : "Anticipation for the new vehicle has caused some confusion among consumers that the Model 3 could be more technologically advanced than Tesla’s current models.",
		"16" : "Mr. Musk declined to say whether orders for the Model S had fallen because buyers were waiting for the Model 3. But he underscored that the Model S would continue to set the brand’s benchmark by offering its highest level of assisted-driving capability and other features.",
		"17" : "Industry analysts said the quarterly results were a secondary issue given the weight of expectations for the Model 3. “A flawless launch of the Model 3 is critical to the company’s future success,” said Jack R. Nerad, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.",
		"18" : "Mr. Musk said on the call that he was pleased with the company’s quarterly results. “We are executing well,” he said. Yet even as he updated investors on the progress of the Model 3, he was already looking ahead to plans to expand into electric pickups and heavy trucks.",
		"19" : "“I am absolutely confident that electric vehicles will occupy every segment without exception,” he said.",
		"20" : "Tesla expects to make 500,000 cars a year by 2018, with the Model 3 accounting for the bulk of the production. That translates into a fivefold increase in its manufacturing pace.",
		"21" : "Tesla is also dealing with growing pains in its labor force. Some production employees have accused the company of suppressing efforts to unionize its work force.",
		"22" : "Last month, the United Auto Workers — the union representing hourly workers at the three big Detroit automakers — filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board asserting that Tesla was trying to block its workers’ organizing efforts.",
		"23" : "Tesla has said the allegations “are entirely without merit.”"

		"1" : "Have you ever tried on a Vanson jacket? One of the serious, sirloin-thick motorcycle ones? First of all, you could use it to defend against bites from aggrieved dogs. You could probably also use it to insulate your roof, or hit a baseball thrown at medium speed. It is stiff, substantial and somehow also luxurious.",
		"2" : "And ludicrous, too, when worn out of context, which is to say, not while racing a BMW HP4 down an open highway at 110 miles per hour.",
		"3" : "Vanson has been on my mind recently, after the Ruff Ryders reunion concert at Barclays Center, which was a reminder of a moment when this sort of lavishly functional clothing was something of a fashion statement. It was one of the most vivid examples — more so than Carhartt coveralls, less so than Kevlar vests — of clothing designed for a specific, and extreme, purpose achieving a sort of sublime, brute elegance when resituated in an unlikely context.",
		"4" : "So naturally, when I went to Genuine Motorworks, a motorcycle-enthusiast clothing and accessories shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I headed straight for the Vanson. There was a particularly emblematic one, in basic black, that I tried on immediately ($950). Or I should say, attempted to try on.",
		"5" : "Where the leather might meet the road is not, it turns out, the same place where it should meet your body. Putting it on was like wrestling with a garage door. Having it on was like wearing a wood plank. This is, of course, by design. Jackets of this type are meant for people who dare death and want a modicum of protection in the process. As a carpetbagger — a leatherbagger? — I was hopeless in it. I took it off and it fell to the floor and broke three of my metatarsals. (Not actually, but it’s less far-fetched than you may think.)",
		"6" : "Generally, I have an aversion to this sort of utilitarian chic. Clothes like this, worn casually, tend to confer an authority the wearer does not have. It’s the reason I generally don’t wear anything military-inspired (and try to avoid even that officious shade of military green). Certainly a Vanson, lovingly worn-in over years, molded to the contours of your shoulders and biceps, would be among the most meaningful garments you could own. But divided from the labor it would take to get there, it was a burdensome cipher.",
		"7" : "I felt much the same riffling through the confusing racks at the Schott store in NoLIta, which is filled with enough leather jackets — motorcycle, flight, shearling and more — to make a novice retreat to a Levi’s store. The classic motorcycle jacket here, the black horsehide Perfecto ($820), is far more accessible than a Vanson, and more wearable too (if, I imagine, less safe in an accident). It also has styles, including the bolero-short 118, geared toward more serious riders, or someone who hopes to pass for one.",
		"8" : "The store didn’t seem to carry the whole of Schott’s offerings. Online, I loved the P2484 casual flight jacket in steely blue and the P267V shearling leather vest in two-tone brown, rust and chocolate. But the store did have plenty of stoic, boxy and firm, like a lovely black-on-black shearling flight jacket ($855). And there was one thrilling casual option: the 654, in black cherry ($695), which was slim and earnestly worn-in and felt like a boot by the divine Italian maker Guidi.",
		"9" : "Luckily, back at Genuine Motorworks, which recently celebrated its eight-year anniversary of catering to both motorcycle fanatics and casual tourists, there were more accessible items that still gave off some eau de moto. After the first Vanson defeated me, I downgraded to the Vanson Redemption jacket, made of heavy waxed cotton that would probably protect you on a moped, but nothing speedier ($379).",
		"10" : "It had an alluring, tough shape and was just pliable enough to take on and off at will (though it was difficult to button). I liked it as much as any ambitiously priced thing I’ve bought at Dover Street Market or Opening Ceremony. In particular, there’s a slinky but rough Saberi jacket that might get the boot if I go back to buy this.",
		"11" : "Elsewhere in the store, there were knickknacks of the riding life: copies of Dice magazine ($10), a sort of high-gloss art-cycle fetish title; technical gear, like a weatherproofed balaclava to wear underneath your helmet ($34); retro hand-painted decorative pieces by Tina Fino; T-shirts and varsity jackets advertising Indian Larry Motorcycles, a custom builder that has its shop a few blocks away.",
		"12" : "Those were all well and good. But for the truly curious, an alcove at the back of the store had real promise: a wall of helmets, in more styles than you might imagine. A staffer who was tolerant of my inquiries encouraged me to have fun, so I engaged in some motorcycle-chic cosplay, from midcentury cosmonaut (Biltwell, $200) to hunger-game futurist (Blauer, $425).",
		"13" : "They didn’t make me any more convincing as a potential rider, but at least they were easy to remove."

		"1" : "Hannah Bronfman, 29, is what you might call a millennial multihyphenate, D.J.-ing fashion parties at night, posing for Adidas and fueling her social media empire by day. (Her Instagram following numbers 358,000 and counting.) Recently she also expanded her Hbfit.com site with the addition of video. Ms. Bronfman grew up on the Upper West Side, but these days she is more likely to be found below 14th Street, in the East Village, which she calls home. This month she is preparing for her wedding to her fellow D.J., Brendan Fallis. Here, learn the beauty products and services she will be relying on.",
		"2" : "My biggest issue is hyperpigmentation and evening out my skin tone. I also break out easily so there are a lot of things I can’t use. I use a cleanser from iS Clinical, and then I spray on this really lovely rose tonic from Pratima. I mix two different vitamin C serums, one by Glossier, called Super C, and one from Drunk Elephant. During the day, I use the 37 Actives cream by Dr. Macrene. And depending on the weather, I might use the Sun Drops by Dr. Barbara Sturm. Dr. Sturm also has a line with Angela Bassett that’s geared toward pigmented skin, and that’s how I first heard about her. One day I was in an Instagram hole, looking at all these beautiful dark girls with beautiful skin, and they were talking about the line.",
		"3" : "At night, I have a foam cleanser I love from a natural Canadian brand called Consonant. I’ve been using it since college. I use that as a first layer of cleansing, then I use either a prescription sulfur-based wash or this facial bar by Drunk Elephant. Then I use P50 by Biologique Recherche, the one for pigmentation. That’s a pretty heavy-duty product. The first time I tried it, it was way too intense, and I didn’t use it again for three years. But then the founder of Vintner’s Daughter — they have some of the few oils that don’t break me out — said she uses P50, and I thought I’d try it again.",
		"4" : "After that, I like the Hydra-Cool Serum by iS Clinical. If I’m traveling a lot, I put a Laneige Water Sleeping Mask on top of that. I love the idea of something other than an oil.",
		"5" : "I’m prone to breaking out on my chest and back because I work out a lot. I’ve been using a body wash by Cane & Austin, and my skin has been reacting so well to it. Actually Cane & Austin just opened its first medi spa, and I’m going there to do my first ever back facial. No one ever wants to talk about “bacne,” but I’m getting married and my dress is backless. I have to get my skin in check. After the shower and before I towel dry, I mix an oil by Mun and another by Pratima. Those, along with Vintner’s Daughter, are the only oils in my regimen.",
		"6" : "I’m obsessed with this all-purpose balm by Make. Morning and night I put it under my brow bone and on my lips. Maybe I’ll use a little lipstick from Charlotte Tilbury, in Pillow Talk. If I’m really amping it up, I’ll add a lip liner from Make Up For Ever.",
		"7" : "I have a concealer — from Hourglass — the shade is tan. If it’s day to day, I might not put on foundation. If it’s sunny, I use a BB cream with SPF. I have one from Nars I really like, and Jouer and Honest Beauty have good ones. They’re in rotation. I don’t do mascara because I have lash extensions from Christian Zamora. Having lashes makes it easier to not wear makeup. I do wear a little blush. Right now, I’m using one from Tom Ford that’s bronze-y and not too pink.",
		"8" : "I don’t really use fragrance. I use essential oils, but not necessarily every day. I got a little bottle of jasmine oil from the Whole Foods in Williamsburg that I really like.",
		"9" : "Shampoo, conditioner — I have some from R&Co and from the Aveda Damage Remedy line. I have a leave-in conditioner from It’s a 10 that I’m obsessed with. I put a little in my hair before I get it blown out. I’m not going places to get my hair done but using apps for people to come to my house. I prefer to use my own products, and I can schedule things a little better.",
		"10" : "This is my natural hair color. I had a good cut in December from Frank Rizzieri, who has a salon in TriBeCa. I met him on a shoot in L.A. For my next haircut, I’m going to see the craziest person, the master guru Garren. He happens to be best friends with my wedding planner’s mother. It’s so random. They grew up together in upstate New York.",
		"11" : "I’m trying to meditate and de-stress instead of working out for the wedding. There’s all this stupid pressure about losing weight for your wedding. I’m really not into it. I work out all the time, but because it’s good for my mental state. I have this whole breathing routine I do before bed and when I wake up. I’ve been trying to go to meditation classes in the city, and I have an app for my phone.",
		"12" : "In terms of eating, I’m trying to be good. I’m not really drinking much. I’m definitely into a high-fat, high-protein type of diet with lots of vegetables.",
		"13" : "On fitness, I can’t believe these words are coming out of my mouth: I’ve been going to Tracy Anderson. I D.J.’ed for them, and they gave me a bunch of classes, and I’m kind of loving it. I also love boxing and dancing classes."

		"2" : "The beast of fashion is one of a kind, like its owner, Ellen Christine Colon-Lugo, 66, who presides over an Alice in Wonderland world filled with hundreds of her handmade confections. They include chiffon Marie Antoinette hats that resemble layer cakes and a $19,500 fedora that took a craftsman in Montecristi, Ecuador, four years to weave; its straw feels as smooth as linen.",
		"3" : "Made in a workshop run out of the loft where she lives, Ms. Colon-Lugo’s chapeaus have been worn with Chanel and Alexander McQueen, and have graced the heads of celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker. For the cover of Harper’s Bazaar, Ms. Parker wore a hat inspired by a Victorian inkwell with a plume pen made of black ostrich feathers; the photograph was one of the images projected onto the Empire State Building for the magazine’s 150th anniversary in late April.",
		"4" : "Also Harrison Ford, who bought a simple Montecristi “that he could roll up and put in his pocket,” Ms. Colon-Lugo said. And Ivana Trump (two cloches) and Lady Gaga (a giant see-through acrylic crownless space-age halo, which the designer called “a walking canopy.”)",
		"5" : "Gwyneth Paltrow wore a cat-eye mask made of 19th-century black Chantilly lace from Ms. Colon-Lugo’s extensive collection of vintage materials, which include hatbands, hatpins, faux flowers and ribbons, spilling out of hatboxes and drawers. The retail price, $480, may seem relatively reasonable, considering that the milliner’s hats cost from $150 to the thousands. But did anyone buy it?",
		"6" : "“No,” Ms. Colon-Lugo said. “Because it’s out of the conscious level of their touchability. They want a $10 mask at the Rite Aid. They want a mask. They don’t want that mask. That’s too special. If I made some cheap version of it, yeah, we’d probably sell hundreds, but why should I? Because they’d make that in China, and who cares.”",
		"7" : "Her work is not so far from that of her predecessors, who took their handcarts to the courts of Europe in bygone centuries. “We like real; I had fake my whole life,” she said. A hat can take from 20 minutes to several months to make.",
		"8" : "Ms. Colon-Lugo studied costume design at the School of Fashion Design in Boston and later at New York University. Her hats have adorned the covers of Vogue, and she is president of the Milliners Guild in New York.",
		"9" : "After many years of hatmaking, including a stint in the West Village before the economics of the business forced her to move, she has wisdom to spare.",
		"10" : "“The idea of balance is very important in a hat,” she said. “I don’t do yoga, I do hats. Hats reveal our inner characters, and we have many of them.”",
		"11" : "This is why she looks into her customers’ eyes, and perhaps their souls, before she designs for them.",
		"12" : "“Most customers go from the top down. ‘This is my little blue dress and I need a hat to go with it,’” she said, imitating one. “I go by the face. Whatever lights up the thousands of little golden balls within you and makes your soul go ping!”",
		"13" : "On the workshop table one Friday in April was a red silk number that resembled a sort of condom and might have been a perfect fit for Jude Law in “The Young Pope.” Ms. Colon-Lugo explained that it was the embryonic centerpiece for a hand-beaded cocktail hat, like a Saturn with many rings, very sculptural and avant-garde, that a client was to wear at the luncheon of the Central Park Conservancy’s women’s committee on Wednesday, with a dress made by Maggie Norris, a fashion designer.",
		"14" : "A hyacinth boater was also heading to the luncheon, as was a gold Chantilly lace fascinator with feathers from the hatter’s own peacock, which lives on her brother’s farm in Puerto Rico.",
		"15" : "It’s not only women who request unusual or flamboyant hats. Dr. Eric Braverman, a physician and author in New York, was recently fitted for an Abraham Lincoln topper to complete an Easter costume. The hat, which included a hidden cellphone pocket, was also sewn with a crown of thorns inside, an allusion to the president’s assassination on Good Friday.",
		"16" : "Spring is Ms. Colon-Lugo’s busiest season. May 15 is Straw Hat Day, when people used to toss off their winter felts and don spring hats. She pooh-poohs National Hat Day, celebrated in January, and calls typical winter wool hats socks.",
		"17" : "Toward the end of April and into May, she works long hours preparing hats for women to wear at the Kentucky Derby, to be run this year on May 6. The Easter Parade and Bonnet Festival are also part of the hatter’s rites of spring, and to that Ms. Colon-Lugo wore one that resembles an elegant lampshade, or a lavender peach basket, wrapped in a contained storm of fuchsia ribbon, a style she calls “1905.”",
		"18" : "The Edwardians, associated with that year and era, inspired her.",
		"19" : "“Let’s face it, they are the ones that got us out of the corsets, went for the suffrage,” she said. “They are the ones that went, ‘No, I’m not a piece of property, I’m an independent entrepreneur.’ The Edwardians carried with them a huge world of angst that was happening all around them, so when I put a hat on like that, it’s the echoes of their voices in my brain. And when you put on something that makes you feel like a pinup doll? You are thinking of Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield and everybody who ever did a 1950s Technicolor movie.”",
		"20" : "What’s on the horizon for hats?",
		"21" : "“Anyone can wear a fedora,” Ms. Colon-Lugo said. “But I see girls starting to look at more women’s hat shapes. The norm was always the round crown, flower on the side, big rim. That was the definition of hats for decades and decades. And then Justin Timberlake put a stingy-brim fedora on. You know, a little trilby, and that started everybody wearing them. I blame it on him.”",
		"22" : "Decorating the walls of her shop like polka dots are everything from pastel Watteau styles to a beaded chain-mail cap that took three months to make, which appeared in a museum show in 2011 and 2012 at the Bard Graduate Center in New York. The show was an extension of one at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London by Stephen Jones, considered a hat god in Britain. There are also boaters in various colors, and a “Cecil Beaton” in silk fabric blooming with roses, inspired by the wallpaper of an exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York.",
		"23" : "Every Colon-Lugo hat is composed of “ingredients” that can be cut up and sewn years later into a new style. This hat guru does not believe in glue.",
		"24" : "“It’s recycling,” said Ms. Colon-Lugo, who calls herself a hippie. “I’ve been living with it since the ’60s. The hats of the 1930s? Those were just the cut up cloches the girls found in their grandmothers’ drawers.”"

		"2" : "In theory, everything in the room was her, or rather a reflection of her. It was the opening of Linda’s, a 600-square-foot shop-within-a-shop on the fourth floor of Bergdorf Goodman. And as the name implies, it houses a selection of items curated by Linda Fargo, the Bergdorf’s public face and chief style maven.",
		"3" : "In truth, one could argue that every item in Bergdorf is a reflection of Ms. Fargo’s, since she is also the department store’s head buyer. (Her official title is senior vice president, fashion and store presentation director.)",
		"4" : "But unlike the rest of the store, Linda’s is not bound by season or product category. The lively space features a mix of vintage and current season ready-to-wear and accessories, artisan chocolate and $110 candles.",
		"5" : "“Who really cares what season it is when they shop?” said the designer Olivier Theyskens, who was among the 100 guests who stopped by the V.I.P. opening on Tuesday night. “This is what shoppers need, a new shopping experience, something truly interesting. I think the way people look to Carrie Bradshaw, that’s how people look at Linda. She’s someone who has a style that is about putting things together in a way you couldn’t expect.”",
		"6" : "Ms. Fargo would embrace that sartorial assessment. “I’m very high-low,” she said, when asked about the giant necklace draped across her chest, a bedazzled pair of red lips on a silver chain. “It’s a street vendor find.” She paired it with a black cape designed by Patricia Field, hand-printed repeatedly with the phrase “She’s the Boss.”",
		"7" : "“It evolves, my style, my eye,” she added. “I hate to say it, but I think it’s like someone who has an ear in music. I have an eye for this.”",
		"8" : "Ms. Fargo’s style has been well documented. Aside from her buying duties, she also functions as the Bergdorf ambassador, often photographed during fashion shows. She is easily identified by a signature look, which includes her silver bob, and her penchant for bright red lipstick and crisp tailoring.",
		"9" : "The cocktail party capitalized on her look with some requisite kitsch: a mod lip-shape sofa, cartoonish cutouts of her hairstyle and other Linda-centric “activations,” to use a public-relations buzzword. In one corner of the party, guests created their “lip signature” with red Chanel lipstick and pieces of paper.",
		"10" : "“Isn’t this just fantastic?” said Martha Stewart, fingering the Grazia and Marica Vozza silk cord wrapped around her neck. “Linda picked this out for me.”",
		"11" : "Ms. Stewart proceeded to inspect the fitting rooms, which are wallpapered in an assortment of front-row invitations Ms. Fargo had received over countless fashion weeks. In a testament to how well liked she is, as well as her influence, several designers stopped by, including Francisco Costa, Alber Elbaz, Derek Lam, Brandon Maxwell, Gilles Mendel and Adam Lippes.",
		"12" : "“It was many, many, many years,” Mr. Elbaz said when asked when he first met Ms. Fargo. “Linda had long hair but she wore it up, like a chignon. It was when I was working Geoffrey Beene.”",
		"13" : "“That’s why she is so precious to me,” he added. “To see people for so many years that stay true to themselves and stay authentic, it’s really great. She’s not only an eye, but a heart.”"

		"2" : "On Wednesday, when the far-right presidential candidate of France Marine Le Pen took the stage in the circular television studio in La Plaine Saint-Denis north of Paris for a potentially decisive debate against her centrist rival, Emmanuel Macron, she did so in a neat navy jacket, collarless V-neck white blouse, pegged trousers and spiky heels. Her makeup was soft, her signature blond flip gently curled at the edges. The classic C-suite palette telegraphed a pulled-together professionalism (she almost matched with Mr. Macron), the shoes suggested an unapologetic femininity and the hair added a motherly halo.",
		"3" : "For the country glued to the TV, it made for a strategic statement, even before she said a word.",
		"4" : "And it underscored the point made by Samir Hammal, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po (the Paris Institute of Political Studies), who said that while “our male presidents have traditionally cast themselves as the fathers of the nation, she has cast herself as the mother.” To this end, she has been a master at dressing the part.",
		"5" : "After all, one of the things the 48-year-old lawyer and mother understood from the very beginning of her political career was just how large a role her own style could play in reshaping perception, not just of herself and her family, but of their party itself. Whatever you think of her politics, and the broader implications of her rise and that of the far right in Europe, that she has gotten so far means it is important to consider the way she has gone about normalizing what was once dismissed as fringe. In this, clothes have played a central role.",
		"6" : "Just because they did so in a country where dress is not deemed an unseemly consideration for serious people, and self-expression through fashion is practically a sacrament, does not make her tactical use of her wardrobe any less resonant for us all.",
		"7" : "Since 2011, when Ms. Le Pen took over the party her father built and moved it away from its anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic roots to make it a palpable, if uncomfortable, force in French politics, she has been deft about using her own image as a tool in separating herself from the French elites, and about making her formerly toxic party look … well, like everybody else. Literally.",
		"8" : "She has transformed herself, as Mr. Hammal said, from the extremist next door to the “woman next door.”",
		"9" : "“All past leaders, from Louis XIV to Napoleon, have used costume to create legitimacy for their power,” Mr. Hammal said. “But Marine Le Pen is one of the best.” She realized early on, he said, that dress could be a tool to help legitimize her party. And that as a woman, with all the greater wardrobe choice and freedom that suggests, she was the ideal person to wield it.",
		"10" : "It began with a haircut. In 2007, when Ms. Le Pen became the director of strategy for her father’s presidential campaign, she lopped off her Farrah Fawcett locks and adopted her shoulder-grazing flip, going from seductive to Doris Day with a touch of the curling iron. Like Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel, she adopted a uniform of basic pantsuits, though she alternates them with straight, above-the-knee skirts to emphasize her femininity (see her much-discussed campaign poster with its flash of thigh) and the occasional jeans and trench coat. The message was generic female executive with a patriotic color palette: red, blue and white, the tones of the tricolor, set off against black and white.",
		"11" : "She has made something of a signature out of being unbranded, abandoning her Dior sunglasses along with the couture trappings of the patrimony that have long been embraced by the French female political establishment.",
		"12" : "Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a former finance minister, for example, is known for her Chanel jackets and Hermès bags. Rachida Dati, a former justice minister in Nicolas Sarkozy’s cabinet, was shown in a Dior dress on the cover of Paris Match. And Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a former mayoral candidate in Paris, wore Dior when she attended the Céline show during her campaign. (She lost, which may have been a signal that things were changing.) Even Brigitte Macron, the wife of Mr. Macron, recently came under fire for borrowing clothes from Louis Vuitton, a practice she began when her husband was finance minister.",
		"13" : "By contrast, Ms. Le Pen went so far as to rent a caped, halter-neck blue gown (designer: who knows?) to wear to the Time 100 gala in 2015. Though there was some head-scratching about the choice, the message was meant to resonate with her base at home, not her fellow partygoers.",
		"14" : "Indeed, she has been adept at adopting her clothes to her constituencies: wearing a bright red jacket, navy shirt and pumps at a party rally; wrinkled black trousers and a zip-up jacket on the streets of Amiens while talking to striking factory workers.",
		"15" : "Mr. Hammal calls this “mirroring,” and for a politician running on a populist ticket, claiming to feel the pain of marginalized working men and women, it has been indubitably effective.",
		"16" : "“If you listened to the same speech coming out of the mouth of a man, it would not have the same effect,” he said. “But because of how she looks when she says it, how maternal she seems, it’s much easier to hear.”",
		"17" : "After all, in the encyclopedia of political tactics, makeover comes just after Machiavelli. Or, perhaps it should from now on.",
		"18" : "By Guy Trebay",
		"19" : "He is the teacher’s pet, or chouchou, who once dressed like the big kid who literally married his high school instructor. He is an economics geek with a degree in philosophy who headed a government finance ministry while clad in the strictly-tailored power suits favored by members of the Grandes Écoles elite.",
		"20" : "He is athletic and mediagenic, a Kennedy-style maverick, a candidate for the digital age and also one whose pretty-boy looks helped propel him onto GQ France’s best-dressed list just as his pragmatic and business-friendly rhetoric carried him to the head of a field of seasoned politicians in the French elections.",
		"21" : "He is Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate who faces off this week in the second and final round of voting for the presidency against his rival, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. As a 39-year-old political novice, Mr. Macron has repeatedly demonstrated that a lack of experience running for public office is no deterrent to an ability to manipulate image and shift shape on a dime. His clothes have been one of the many platforms he has used to convey his message to the divided population.",
		"22" : "“His style and self-presentation reek of health, vigor and physical prowess,” Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, a senior research fellow at the London School of Fashion and an expert on fashion semiotics, said in an email.",
		"23" : "“The sharp suits make him look disciplined, but also energetic,” Ms. Cronberg added, and they offer a defining visual contrast with the rumpled and often fumbling appearance of the departing president, the Socialist François Hollande.",
		"24" : "Superficially, Mr. Macron’s sober two-button suits are all but indistinguishable from those favored by most high-level French businessmen and politicians. Yet they have been modified and altered repeatedly as his poll numbers shifted and he sought to look more — although never too baldly — presidential.",
		"25" : "In other words, when the dapper tailored suits the candidate wore in both his ministry days and at the start of his campaign — invariably with a sky-blue shirt and Windsor-knotted, solid-color four-in-hand tie — first drew attention for their obvious price tags, he promptly ditched them. “No ordinary person wears suits that cost 1,000 euros,” Mr. Macron’s right-hand aide, Ismaël Emelien, said. “That’s too expensive.”",
		"26" : "When his natty midnight-blue suits began attracting the perhaps unwanted attention of the French fashion news media, the candidate immediately lowered his sartorial profile and his expenses. Soon he was spotted dressed as a midprice version of his former self, clad in clothes made for him by Jean-Claude and Laurent Toubol, whose small tailoring shop in the Paris garment district has become a default outfitter of French tyro politicians, from Guillaume Larrivé, 40, a member of the French National Assembly, to Patrice Bessac, 39, the Communist mayor of Montreuil.",
		"27" : "Other youthful politicians have faced the challenge Mr. Macron now does: to balance an image representative of the entrepreneurial France he imagines driving into a digital future and a hidebound traditional one. The open-neck shirts of Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, were an image fail. So, too, would a vision of Mr. Macron be in the hoodies and jeans favored by the tech wizards he sees as vital to a French economic future stoked by start-ups like the ride-sharing app BlaBlaCar or the niche internet retailer Vente-privee.",
		"28" : "Still, that he elects to wear suits in almost every setting, outside the ski slopes, is both strategic and a necessity, Ms. Cronberg said. “Those perennial dark suits,” she explained, continue to serve an important function, despite the widespread abandonment of the suit by the wider fashion world. “They speak of respectability and tradition and of how powerful men control others by controlling themselves.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Jimmy Kimmel’s tearful description of his newborn son’s heart defect has galvanized parents across the country. A few shared his experience as a frantic new father; many more gave silent thanks that they had been spared this ordeal.",
		"2" : "But the talk-show host’s monologue has also focused new attention on how infants with such birth defects were cared for before passage of the Affordable Care Act, and what may lie ahead for them should the legislation be repealed.",
		"3" : "“No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life,” Mr. Kimmel said. Some medical experts, too, are deeply worried that these young patients may not receive the intense care they need.",
		"4" : "“The physical, emotional and financial tolls that families experience caring for children with complex chronic health problems are already extraordinary,” said Dr. Jay Berry, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital.",
		"5" : "“It’s unfathomable, then, that we could make things worse by limiting or taking away the child’s health care coverage.”",
		"6" : "Roughly 40,000 infants are born each year with a heart defect. The one that struck Mr. Kimmel’s son is called Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia; it affects about seven of every 100,000 babies born alive and accounts for 2 percent of all congenital heart defects.",
		"7" : "The condition is hard to miss: The child is often born blue because the passage from the heart to the lungs is completely blocked. Blood cannot get to the lungs, where it would be oxygenated.",
		"8" : "The infant is alive only because a passageway to the lungs during fetal development remains, letting blood get through. It will close, though, and the condition can be fatal without immediate surgery, which can cost $100,000.",
		"9" : "Roughly 90 percent of these children will survive to age 18, but the initial surgery is just a temporary fix. Doctors usually have to operate several times over the years. And people with the condition need regular care from experts.",
		"10" : "“It’s a disease of a lifetime,” said Dr. Yuri Kim, director of the adult congenital heart disease center at the University of Pennsylvania.",
		"11" : "Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, federal law required employer-sponsored plans to cover newborns regardless of their health status as long as their parents enrolled them within 30 days, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
		"12" : "If parents switched jobs, their new insurers could not impose waiting periods or charge more for sick newborns.",
		"13" : "But things were different for parents who bought their insurance individually.",
		"14" : "All 50 states had laws requiring newborns to be covered under a parent’s insurance policy and not to be charged more if they were sick, if they were enrolled within 30 days. But if a parent switched plans after a baby’s birth, the new insurer could refuse to cover the care for an ill infant for an initial period of time or charge more, Ms. Pollitz said.",
		"15" : "They could also do so if the parents were uninsured to begin with.",
		"16" : "Lifetime limits on coverage were a problem, too. In both individual and employer-sponsored plans, some critically ill children met policy limits within the first few years of their lives.",
		"17" : "Ms. Pollitz pointed out, however, that about half of all newborns were and still are insured by Medicaid, “which basically says whatever the kid needs is covered.” Many infants with severe congenital defects require home care provided under the program, as well.",
		"18" : "Under the Republican repeal-and-replace bill, the biggest concern for seriously ill newborns may be cuts to the Medicaid program. The Republican plan would give states a choice between a fixed annual sum per recipient or a block grant, either of which would almost certainly lead to major limitations in coverage over time.",
		"19" : "The bill would also allow states to opt out of several consumer protections, including the Affordable Care Act’s ban on insurance companies’ charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing medical conditions.",
		"20" : "That could affect the roughly 8 percent of Americans who rely on the individual insurance market, though only if they had been uninsured for 63 days or more in the previous year.",
		"21" : "Under this plan, families with sick children who rely on individual coverage would “have to be meticulous about signing up at every open enrollment and never missing a payment,” Ms. Pollitz said.",
		"22" : "“One slip-up, and you’re back in the underwritten pool again and could be charged an unaffordable amount.”",
		"23" : "The Republican bill would also let states allow insurers to offer skimpier coverage than the Affordable Care Act requires, and it would provide smaller premium tax credits for many Americans.",
		"24" : "“You’re going to have a certain level of income to even be able to afford the coverage in the first place,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University.",
		"25" : "Even now, parents of newborns with severe heart defects struggle for care.",
		"26" : "Ideally, infants with congenital heart defects receive surgery in specialized medical centers, said Dr. Gerald Marx, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, which performs about 1,400 of these operations each year. Outcomes are better if the surgeon and medical center are highly experienced.",
		"27" : "Not every state has specialized congenital heart disease centers, yet families often have insurance policies that do not cover medical care outside their state.",
		"28" : "“When the insurers won’t pay for it, very tragically, they end up just not coming,” Dr. Marx said.",
		"29" : "The future worries Elizabeth Swift, of Billerica, Mass., whose son, James, now 7, was born with the same heart defect as Mr. Kimmel’s son.",
		"30" : "She and her husband were so stressed and distracted after his birth and open-heart surgery that they missed the 30-day window to inform their insurer in order to guarantee coverage. The insurance company refused to cover their son’s care.",
		"31" : "“I was getting bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars in the mail,” she said. “I just cried and said, ‘I can’t deal with this now.’”",
		"32" : "Eventually, she managed to obtain coverage for her son from the state. When the Affordable Care Act passed, her husband’s company insurance agreed to cover James.",
		"33" : "Now she worries about what might happen to James’s insurance and that of other children with severe congenital defects if the Republican bill passes.",
		"34" : "What if lawmakers restore insurers’ ability to impose lifetime caps on the amount they will pay? What might happen in the long term, after James turns 26 and can no longer be covered under his parents’ insurance?",
		"35" : "“I am praying,” Mrs. Swift said."

	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/nyregion/a-republican-primary-conundrum-how-far-to-run-from-christie.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "ROCKAWAY, N.J. — The political postcard that landed recently in New Jersey mailboxes appeared routine: piling on the Christie administration as “failed” and tying the lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, to the “wrong direction” of the state’s fortunes.",
		"2" : "In campaign season, such attacks against Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, arrive at a frequent clip. But this mailing was paid for by a fellow Republican seeking to succeed Mr. Christie: Assemblyman Jack M. Ciattarelli.",
		"3" : "“People would say to me you’re being critical and I would say I’m only being honest,” Mr. Ciattarelli said of his campaign’s language in an interview before an event here. “I’m a citizen first, and when I think an administration or a governor or a president has gotten it wrong, I think it’s important to speak up.”",
		"4" : "With less than 40 days to go before the Republican primary for governor, the two Republican candidates vying to replace Mr. Christie are gauging how best to navigate their relationship with a member of their own party who has close ties to the president but is also among the least popular governors in state history.",
		"5" : "Ms. Guadagno is leading in early polling — a new poll from Quinnipiac University released on Wednesday showed the lieutenant governor at 23 percent among likely Republican voters, compared with 12 percent among the same group for Mr. Ciattarelli in the Republican primary. And on Wednesday she picked up the endorsement of the comedian Joe Piscopo, who had been publicly flirting with a run for governor, but decided against it and instead endorsed Ms. Guadagno.",
		"6" : "But Mr. Christie’s record low approval figures will make it challenging for any Republican to win, and the Democratic Party favorite, Philip D. Murphy, was leading Ms. Guadagno 50 percent to 25 percent in a two-way contest in Wednesday’s poll of likely New Jersey voters. The poll carried a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.",
		"7" : "Given that backdrop, it is not surprising that neither Ms. Guadagno nor Mr. Ciattarelli has embraced Mr. Christie. At the same time, Mr. Christie still has pockets of support among Republican primary voters, especially in the northern and western parts of the state. A Quinnipiac poll in March found that about half of registered Republicans approved of the governor’s job performance.",
		"8" : "Ms. Guadagno has the more delicate dance: As the second-in-command in the administration, she owns some of the record. And while she is trying to separate herself from the governor on certain issues, she also needs the support of Republican voters who have remained loyal to the governor.",
		"9" : "She has had a relatively chilly relationship with the governor during his tenure that has only worsened on the campaign trail. In her stump speech, Ms. Guadagno has adopted a bit of a “hear no evil, speak no evil” style; she rarely, if ever, invokes the governor’s name. Not when she boasts about the state’s economy, and not when she laments the many problems facing New Jersey, including an underfunded pension system and public transportation woes.",
		"10" : "Instead, she dishes out coy insults, like discussing Mr. Christie’s plans to renovate the State House in Trenton by invoking the term “Palace of Versailles,” and noting that she doesn’t travel around the state by helicopter.",
		"11" : "Then there are the direct, public breaks from the governor, such as over a gas tax increase — which Mr. Christie ultimately supported after opposing it — or Mr. Christie’s plan to have Horizon, a private insurer, pay for the state’s drug treatment program.",
		"12" : "But even on these issues, Ms. Guadagno goes to great lengths to avoid saying Mr. Christie’s name.",
		"13" : "“You can negotiate and that’s one thing, and that’s something that’s perfectly legitimate,” she told reporters last month in response to a question about Mr. Christie’s public battles with Horizon, according to The Observer. “But to demand it and take it is another thing. I don’t think that’s something government should do.”",
		"14" : "Mr. Ciattarelli has more freedom, having been a bit of a thorn in the governor’s side for years, and he has been upfront about criticizing the governor as he tries to eat into Ms. Guadagno’s lead.",
		"15" : "He gave the governor a “D” in an interview with The Star-Ledger and has frequently criticized him as someone who has put his own ambitions above the state’s needs.",
		"16" : "“Eight years of the Christie-Guadagno administration has gone by, and we still have a property tax crisis, school funding crisis, tax code crisis, affordable housing crisis,” Mr. Ciattarelli told a crowd gathered here Monday for a town-hall meeting that included his signature PowerPoint presentation.",
		"17" : "Voters who came out to see Mr. Ciattarelli had similar sentiments.",
		"18" : "“Given the popularity and public consumption of these policies, I would have to say a change would be in order,” said Jim Schanz, 59, a communications researcher from Hamilton who drove two hours to see Mr. Ciattarelli. But he cautioned that criticizing the governor and changing direction needed to be done within the framework of Republican politics. “We don’t want a change to the opposite extreme.”",
		"19" : "Mr. Christie, for his part, has been responding, even before a lot of stones had been cast. During a February speech to the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Mr. Christie said that Democrats and Republicans were promoting alternative versions of the truth.",
		"20" : "“Either they’re lying or they’re going to increase taxes so much that people are not going to be able to live here anymore,” Mr. Christie told reporters, referring to promises being made on the campaign trail.",
		"21" : "When asked if he was speaking about both the Republican and Democratic candidates, Mr. Christie smiled.",
		"22" : "“Yeah, I’ve said there’s examples on both sides,” he said. “A little more stark on the Democratic side, but yeah, on both sides.”",
		"23" : "Throughout the early stages of the race, Mr. Christie has continued to attack positions put forth by candidates, including  criticizing Ms. Guadagno’s plan to audit state government spending in order to help cap property taxes.",
		"24" : "Attacking the governor may prove necessary for both Ms. Guadagno and Mr. Ciattarelli, who will face an uphill battle in the fall against a Democratic nominee in an increasingly blue state.",
		"25" : "“I think that most Republicans are savvy enough to realize that if a Republican is going to have even the slightest bit of a fighting chance against the Democratic nominee,” said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a political-science professor at Montclair State University, “they’re going to need to run away from Christie.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "ALBANY  — When the State of New York approved the use of medical marijuana  in 2014, the applicants to dispense the drug were vetted and reviewed by a panel of experts said to have deep backgrounds in several fields.",
		"2" : "The identities of the panel’s members had been a mystery since. By July 2015, the panel had chosen five companies that would receive exclusive statewide medical marijuana licenses, a potentially lucrative award in a state with nearly 20 million residents and hundreds of thousands of potential patients.",
		"3" : "A September 2015 Freedom of Information request by The New York Times, seeking the names of the panel’s members, was delayed nine times. On Friday, the request was effectively denied, as the department said that it did not “maintain records” or contact information for the panel.",
		"4" : "On Monday, however, the department reversed course and disclosed the names of the panel’s 17 evaluators: all state employees, most with little or no prior professional experience in medical marijuana.",
		"5" : "They included a number of Health Department scientists as well as three architects, an accountant and an auditor. They were chosen for their specialties — including chemistry, internal medicine, and pharmaceutical drugs, according to the department — to create a “multidisciplinary team.”",
		"6" : "The state’s program has been criticized for a cumbersome and often opaque roll-out, in part because of restrictions placed on the drug’s medical use — for example, it cannot be smoked and must be used in forms like tinctures and oils. Critics have also faulted the state for seemingly opting to create a model from scratch, despite more than 20 other states having medical marijuana programs, an assertion that the Health Department disputes, saying its panel — despite its lack of expertise in the field — drew from other states’ experiences.",
		"7" : "The identity and methodology of the panel has taken on new import in recent months as the Health Department has moved to use their 2015 evaluations as a basis for awarding licenses to as many as five additional companies, part of a broader effort to expand access to the drug.",
		"8" : "Critics, and even some supporters, of the program have said that the small number of dispensaries — 20 approved statewide — and the high cost of medical marijuana has made it difficult for some patients to get the drug, particularly in remote or rural areas.",
		"9" : "Companies running the dispensaries have said that they have yet to make a profit; a trade association representing the five current licensees filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Albany seeking to halt the expansion.",
		"10" : "The suit claims that the Health Department had unilaterally decided to grant more licenses even after a two-year report issued in August offered evidence that the program had been struggling to take hold with doctors and patients. The plaintiffs suggest that an expansion “will result in irreparable harm” to individual companies and threaten the existence of the whole program.",
		"11" : "“Flooding the supply market when there is insufficient patient demand will undermine the viability of the entire program,” the lawsuit says, adding that more dispensaries could also make it difficult for companies to raise more capital.",
		"12" : "State Senator Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island who was a champion of the 2014 legislation that created the program, said she had warned health officials that a lawsuit was possible after they had announced the expansion this year.",
		"13" : "“These guys are on the hook for tens of millions of dollars each,” she said. “So the expansion of these licenses would only serve to harm them even further. So I’m certainly not surprised.”",
		"14" : "Ms. Savino added that she personally did not think that the program needed additional organizations to grow and produce marijuana as medicine, but she does suggest additional dispensaries. “They could just issue dispensary-only licenses,” she said.",
		"15" : "Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, another of the program’s legislative sponsors, said the law allowed for the authorization of additional organizations, but he echoed Ms. Savino’s call for more dispensaries, saying that “it would help existing producers.”",
		"16" : "Despite a long lobbying campaign by patients and caregivers, the program did not make an immediate impact. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo demanded strict regulations in exchange for his support for legalizing the drug for medical usage. Critics blame the restrictive regulations for the program’s initial struggles to attract and certify patients and doctors.",
		"17" : "Facing complaints, the Health Department announced a series of changes to the program in late 2016, including adding chronic pain as a treatable condition and allowing nurse practitioners to certify patients. Those changes have shown that the Cuomo administration seems to have “definitely turned a corner in its attitude toward the program,” Mr. Gottfried said.",
		"18" : "All told, approximately 17,600 patients — and nearly 1,000 medical professionals — have been approved for the program, whose first dispensaries opened in January 2016. Still, advocates for the drug say that problems with the program still exist, including the difficulty in finding physicians and other medical professionals certified to recommend the treatment.",
		"19" : "“As someone who has been working on medical cannabis for three years now in this state, I have yet to know one patient that feels the program is serving their needs entirely,” said Kate Hintz, state director of Compassionate Care NY, a group that lobbies for medical marijuana, citing a limited and inconsistent product selection. “The product they buy one month is not the same strength the next month — a huge red flag for medical patients.”",
		"20" : "Jill Montag, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said that the state still intended to issue five additional licenses in the first half of 2017, and that such an expansion will address many of the concerns voiced by Ms. Hintz and others, including geographic diversity, affordability and variety of products.",
		"21" : "As for the once unknown panelists who chose the organizations, Ms. Montag did not comment directly on the lack of experience of the panel, but said that members of the panel “were carefully selected for their expertise in specific disciplines” and called the process of ranking applicants “extensive, thorough and entirely transparent.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Republican Party leaders have decided that Bo Dietl, the bombastic former police detective and Fox News contributor, should not be allowed to run on their party line in his bid to become mayor of New York City.",
		"2" : "County Republican leaders in New York concluded during a conference call over the weekend that Mr. Dietl did not have enough support among their ranks to get a so-called Wilson-Pakula certification that he needed to run as a Republican. Without the party, his chances of mounting an effective challenge against Mayor Bill de Blasio in November’s election seemed severely damaged, if not doomed.",
		"3" : "Mr. Dietl, who is not a registered member of a political party, appeared to have harmed his candidacy during a Republican candidate screening last week when, in the final minutes, he compared a state judge to Mr. de Blasio’s wife; both women are black.",
		"4" : "“Bo Dietl is not going to be on a major party line,” Adele Malpass, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party, said on Tuesday. “He proved he’s having trouble transitioning from being a celebrity to a serious candidate. We have other people running who have proven track records who can take on Bill de Blasio.”",
		"5" : "Party leaders had been intrigued by his name recognition, ability to draw news media attention and capacity to tap well-heeled donors.",
		"6" : "Ultimately, his unscripted style, which is reminiscent of President Trump, was apparently not the right fit for the party as it tries to defy the odds in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.",
		"7" : "Mr. Dietl, who voted for President Trump and describes himself as a lifelong Republican, had attempted to enroll as a member of the Democratic Party last year when he changed his voter registration to New York City, from Nassau County, so that he could challenge Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary. But he filled out the registration form incorrectly by checking the boxes for two political parties — Democratic and Independence — when only one is permitted. As a result he ended up without any party affiliation.",
		"8" : "Mr. Dietl went to court to try to fix the error, and that is where he encountered Judge Debra A. James.",
		"9" : "“The judge looked like Charlene de Blasio,” Mr. Dietl told a packed room of Republican Party members and leaders on the Upper East Side during the candidate screening. He was referring to Mr. de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray. “As soon as I saw her,” he said. “I knew I had a problem.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Dietl stuck by the remark even after it brought him scorn across social media and on the editorial pages of The New York Post, which argued that the party “looks ridiculous even considering letting him enter the race.”",
		"11" : "Mr. Dietl may still seek the Conservative Party line and has said he would run on his own “Dump de Blasio” line regardless of whether he gets any party line.",
		"12" : "“They ought to be ashamed of themselves for not giving me the Wilson-Pakula,” Mr. Dietl said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “What are they afraid of? What is everybody afraid of?”",
		"13" : "He added: “The Republicans are going to run a loser and they’re going to lose the election.” He said that Ms. Malpass told him on Tuesday that no decision had yet been made and he accused her of lying to him. “Once again he’s mixed up,” Ms. Malpass responded on Wednesday.",
		"14" : "The Republican party leaders reached consensus during a conference call on Saturday in which all five counties were represented.",
		"15" : "None voiced support for granting him a waiver to run in the party, said Bob Turner, a former congressman and the chairman of the Queens Republican Party. In theory, each county’s executive committee could ignore its leader’s directive and vote to give Mr. Dietl the waiver, but that is extremely unlikely to happen.",
		"16" : "“He’s not getting the Wilson-Pakula,” Ms. Malpass said.",
		"17" : "“There’s not support within three of the five counties at this time,” said Ted Ghorra, the Brooklyn Republican Party chairman, who also participated in the call. He added that without three counties supporting the move, it would not move forward.",
		"18" : "As for Staten Island, John Antoniello, who stepped down as the party chairman in February but has stayed close to its workings, said his position on whether to let Mr. Dietl onto the party line was clear: “I am not in favor of it.”",
		"19" : "The Bronx chairman, Michael Rendino, declined to comment.",
		"20" : "In Queens, the county committee members voted on Monday to endorse Paul J. Massey Jr., a millionaire real estate sales executive who has shown fund-raising prowess but has yet to energize the party. Mr. Massey received 12 votes of the 22 members present for the vote, Mr. Turner said. (Mr. Dietl was not among the choices.)",
		"21" : "Mr. Massey is competing with the Rev. Michel J. Faulkner, a charismatic Harlem pastor who impressed many at the screening last week but has struggled to raise money, and with Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn and entered the race last week. (John Catsimatidis, the grocery store magnate, on Monday formally said he would not enter the mayor’s race.)",
		"22" : "Mr. Antoniello said that Mr. Dietl’s remark about the judge underscored why he should not be allowed to run. “It’s a bad stigma on the party,” he said.",
		"23" : "For his part, Mr. Dietl predicted that the energy in the Republican Party primary would dissipate without him.",
		"24" : "“Massey is Melba toast, Nicole is not ready for prime time and Faulkner owes so much money,” he said. “I’ll take any lines I can take. If someone has the testiculization to bank on me, whoever does that. I’m running regardless.”"

	"date" : "2017-05-04",
	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/nyregion/judith-clark-parole-interview.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "In 1983, at age 33, Judith Clark, fist-waving radical, vision of defiance, mother of a toddler, was sentenced to a minimum of 75 years in prison for her role in a murderous raid on a Brink’s armored truck in Rockland County, N.Y. She had been a getaway driver.",
		"2" : "“Revolutionary violence is necessary,” she told the court, indifferent to the presence of the families and friends of three men killed in the robbery and escape: Peter Paige, a Brink’s guard, and Sgt. Edward O’Grady and Officer Waverly Brown of the Nyack Police Department. Among the loved ones left behind were nine children. Others were badly, permanently injured.",
		"3" : "It would be years before Judith Clark gave any of them more than a glancing thought.",
		"4" : "“I thought of myself as a symbol of revolutionary fervor and commitment,” she said this week. “I didn’t think about my child. I didn’t think about the families sitting in that courtroom. Because it was all about symbols, and not people.”",
		"5" : "Last month, improbably, Ms. Clark found herself appearing before a parole board nearly 40 years ahead of schedule. In 35 years behind bars, she had undergone what many saw as a profound transformation, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo granted her clemency in December. He cut her minimum term to the time served, giving her a chance to get out of prison before she died. The decision on her release would be in the hands of a board of three people. “She has a hell of a case,” Mr. Cuomo said in January.",
		"6" : "In an interview on Monday at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, the maximum-security prison for women, Ms. Clark discussed publicly for the first time what happened after the governor’s action. Over the course of a two-hour conversation, she talked about the board’s process and some of the political dynamics, how she learned of the decision, and the rippling emotional currents that it carried through the prison.",
		"7" : "On April 21, she was summoned to meet with the prison superintendent.",
		"8" : "“She asked, ‘Do you want to open the envelope, or do you want me to say the decision first, and then you can read it?’ ” Ms. Clark said. “I said yes. So she told me: ‘You didn’t get it.’ I read it. She said, ‘We were rooting for you.’ ”",
		"9" : "On the way back to her quarters, other prisoners greeted her in excitement. “People said, ‘You made it,’ and I’m like, ‘No.’ And no one heard me the first time. No one. I had to repeat it over and over and over again. They weren’t asking me. They just assumed it. It was kind of communally painful.",
		"10" : "“People here want to believe that what we do matters. That what we do wrong matters, and that what we do right matters. They had connected their sense of hope to me.”",
		"11" : "The parole board — Tina Stanford, G. Kevin Ludlow and Sally Thompson, appointees of three different governors, including Mr. Cuomo — voted unanimously to deny her parole.",
		"12" : "She was not likely to cause trouble in the future, the board said, and it commended her for accomplishing a great deal in prison. In effect, the board echoed the governor’s judgment about the strength of her case. But it had heard from thousands of people, including most police unions and organizations in the state, who had written, clicked online petitions or testified, convincing the board that her release would “undermine respect for the law” by depreciating the seriousness of her crime.",
		"13" : "“You are still a symbol of violent and terroristic crime,” the board said.",
		"14" : "For decades after the Brink’s robbery and killings, Ms. Clark kept a public silence and developed what many prison officials saw as authentic, private remorse. “I had to grapple with what happened to my humanity,” she said.",
		"15" : "She became an educator for women in prison with AIDS, helped arrange college courses, led prenatal and newborn classes, became a chaplain’s assistant, trained service dogs. Mr. Cuomo met with her in September. At the end of the year, she was one of 113 people who received various forms of clemency, a sudden revival of a power that had scarcely been used by governors for years.",
		"16" : "Of all of them, Ms. Clark’s case held the greatest political risk for a governor who is thought to harbor ambitions for national office. By denying Ms. Clark, the board overshadowed his decision, at least until her next scheduled hearing, in 2019.",
		"17" : "She spent seven hours before the board, which rarely allocates an hour to a case. For much of that time, she said, commissioners read letters and other documents into the record. They asked many of the same questions the governor had, she said, but, she felt, with far less interest in her answers. The commissioners wanted to know what would happen if she were granted release.",
		"18" : "“I thought it would show the success of their criminal justice system and that my punishment for the crime was serious,” Ms. Clark said. “It was 35 years, the bulk of my adulthood. It could point to the ability to change, and to take responsibility. In a time of enormous, heightened anger and clashing, I am someone who once believed in violence and now believes in respecting human life.”",
		"19" : "And, she was asked, what if the board said no? Ms. Clark said she would not change, a statement quoted in the decision. The board, she said, did not include the rest of her response to that question: that refusing her would heighten cynicism among prisoners about the parole process.",
		"20" : "That two of the victims were police officers plainly was decisive. “These are officers of the law, we are asking them to do a job and we have to let them know that we care about their lives,” Ms. Clark said. “That’s an aspect of the decision that is understandable. On the other hand, we don’t want to say some people’s lives are less important than other people’s lives.”",
		"21" : "One letter to the board, from Nancy Gropper in New York City, captured the complexity of the issue. She wrote: “As the mother of a New York City police officer, I realize full well the unmitigated grief experienced by the families whose innocent loved ones died as a result of this 1981 crime. I have nothing but empathy for them and am not sure that I could ever endorse the parole of anyone who harmed my son, who works so diligently to protect the citizens of NYC. But perhaps this is why parole boards are charged with making these decisions — decisions too fraught with emotions for the families of victims.”",
		"22" : "Many times, parole boards cite the “nature of the crime” in denying parole, invoking its symbolic weight. Without taking into account changes by the prisoner, a loop of routine denial is formed. “The nature of the crime never changes,” Ms. Clark said.",
		"23" : "Last year, a man named John MacKenzie, who killed a police officer named Matthew Giglio on Long Island in 1976, was denied parole for the 10th time. Though his prison record was exemplary, parole boards repeatedly ruled against his release as police organizations lobbied against it. Mr. MacKenzie served 40 years on a 25-year minimum term. A judge held the board in contempt for failing to apply appropriate legal standards, but it made no difference in the decisions. Mr. MacKenzie, 70, took his life in August.",
		"24" : "“I feel like I am sort of living with his spirit,” Ms. Clark said. “I wish he hadn’t done what he did. I totally understand why he did. I will certainly try hard not to do that. I want to live it out.”",
		"25" : "As she spoke this week, Legend, a black Labrador dog that she is training, sat by her. The dogs typically serve disabled veterans, though some of her canine pupils went to work for law enforcement.",
		"26" : "Referring to one of the board members, she said, “Mr. Ludlow said that he found it ironic that I raised dogs for veterans, and he said that work was noble, and yet the three people I killed were all veterans, and he talked about their service.”",
		"27" : "She went on: “I said to him that I didn’t think it was ironic, and I don’t think that my work with the dogs is noble. I think it’s one of the ways that I try to reckon with the fact that I am responsible for those people dying.”",
		"28" : "At 67, Ms. Clark no longer has the energy for puppies. In the early months of the year, as she was awaiting her hearing, three important figures in her life died: Steven McDonald, the police officer paralyzed by a teenager with a gun, who had visited her twice, discussing her Judaism and his Catholicism, and praying the rosary; and the journalists Wayne Barrett and Jimmy Breslin. “I felt like I was in a liminal period where life and death was in the air,” she said.",
		"29" : "And now?",
		"30" : "“I don’t live the way I do because I’m trying to get out of prison,” Ms. Clark said. “I live the way I do because it’s the only truth I can come and stand on, in the face of both my crime and the lessons of my life since then.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Among the many people President Trump has antagonized during his brief yet turbulent time in office, few were quite as surprised to receive his ire as the Australians. Though the United States and Australia have long been allied in war and trade, Mr. Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in late January after the Australian leader urged him to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center.",
		"2" : "Things only soured further when Mr. Trump took to Twitter to excoriate the agreement. “I will study this dumb deal!” he declared in a post a few days later.",
		"3" : "On Thursday, the president will have a chance for reconciliation when he boards the hangar deck of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum for a dinner commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which United States and Australian naval and air forces fought Japan during World War II. The conflict is often remembered as “the battle that saved Australia.”",
		"4" : "“There’s a deep and broad connection between the two countries that most people don’t know enough about,” said John Berry, a former United States ambassador to Australia and the president of the American Australian Association, which is hosting the event. “I’m glad we’re taking a moment to really celebrate that.”",
		"5" : "The American Australian Association, a little-known yet industrious nonprofit organization with offices in the Financial District of Manhattan, has been working for decades to strengthen relations between the countries. Founded in 1948 by the journalist Keith Murdoch, the association was intended to spark American governmental and business interests in Australia after World War II. Since then, the scope of its ambitions has expanded to include cultural, educational and philanthropic activity. Its Education Fund, for example, has financed the participation of more than 200 fellows in postgraduate study between Australia and the United States since 2002.",
		"6" : "The dinner on Thursday will raise money to start a new fund for veterans. It will also be the first time an American president has met with the association, Mr. Berry said, and the first in-person encounter between Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull.",
		"7" : "Perhaps nowhere is that burgeoning cultural kinship more apparent than New York, which has experienced a surge of Australian immigration in recent years. The Australian Consulate now estimates that there are approximately 20,000 Australians in New York; a decade ago, a census survey estimated that there were fewer than 6,000.",
		"8" : "With those immigrants has come a swell of Australian culture in a city already rich with international life. New Yorkers have taken notice. In 2014, the website Gothamist posted an article asking, “What’s the Deal With All These Australians in NYC?” The upswing, as it noted, can be attributed in part to the E-3 program, a class of visa introduced under President George W. Bush in 2005 exclusively for Australians that is easier and less expensive to obtain than the conventional H-1B work visa. Every year, more than 10,000 E-3 visas are reserved for Australian nationals.",
		"9" : "“Australians focus not only on work but on vacation and quality of life, so when they come it’s for six weeks or six months, not just six days like most tourists,” Mr. Berry said. “And if you look around the city, you’re starting to see their impact.”",
		"10" : "A healthy collection of Australian bars, restaurants, and clothing stores have taken root in a stretch of NoLIta, around Mulberry Street, that some people call Little Australia. Now, alongside the typical Manhattan fare, Australians can find comfort in the familiar taste of flat whites and chants of “Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi!” As time has passed, more and more longtime New Yorkers have also begun to better understand their antipodal counterparts.",
		"11" : "“Back when we first got here, everyone used to think we were all Crocodile Dundee with kangaroos in our backyards,” said Tim Sykes, 32, a co-owner of Ruby’s Cafe, an Australian restaurant on Mulberry Street. “But now that we’re all over the place, Aussie life is kind of taking hold.”",
		"12" : "The transformation has been evident in at least one crucial way for Mr. Sykes. “Now you can actually find Vegemite in some restaurants,” he said.",
		"13" : "Still, that sense of comfort was upended by Mr. Trump’s clash with Mr. Turnbull. In late April, Vice President Mike Pence helped smooth over relations when during a visit to Australia, he confirmed the countries’ “strong and historic alliance.”",
		"14" : "Since Mr. Trump’s comments, Mr. Sykes said, he and many of his Australian friends have been calling their immigration lawyers, worried that their status might shift. For now, Mr. Sykes is counting on the meeting Thursday to help return a sense of normalcy.",
		"15" : "“That’d be ripper, mate,” he said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Of all the stresses that humans have inflicted on the world’s oceans, including pollution and global warming, industrial fishing ranks high. For years, trawlers capable of scouring the ocean floor, and factory ships trailing driftnets and longlines baited with thousands of hooks, have damaged once-abundant fisheries to the point where, the United Nations says, 90 percent of them are now fully exploited or facing collapse.",
		"2" : "The damage is not just to the fish and the ecosystem but also to people who depend on them for food and income. This is particularly true in Africa. In 2008, in two striking articles, The Times reported that mechanized fleets from the European Union, Russia and China had nearly picked clean the oceans off Senegal and other northwest African countries, ruining coastal economies.",
		"3" : "It’s still happening, but now, according to a report by The Times’s Andrew Jacobs, China stands alone as the major predator.",
		"4" : "With its own waters heavily overfished, and being forced to forage elsewhere to feed its people, the Chinese government commands a fleet of nearly 2,600 vessels, 10 times larger than the United States fleet, all heavily subsidized. As Zhang Hongzhou of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University observes, “For China’s leaders, ensuring a steady supply of aquatic products is not just about good economics but social stability and political legitimacy.”",
		"5" : "The result: The Chinese government is basically snatching fish out of the nets of poor fishermen in Africa in order to keep fish on plates in China. A new study published by the journal Frontiers in Marine Science says that most Chinese ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in a week as Senegalese boats catch in a year, costing West African economies some $2 billion.",
		"6" : "Further, many Chinese ships don’t hesitate to break the law to meet soaring demand. In 2015, Greenpeace found numerous cases of illegal Chinese fishing in West African waters, including ships that misreported their coordinates or underreported their tonnage: known ploys to fish in prohibited areas. Yet this presents nations like Senegal with a difficult choice, because China is also pumping $60 billion into African development. As Alassane Samba, the former head of Senegal’s Oceanic Research Institute, put it, “It’s hard to say no to China when they are building your roads.”",
		"7" : "China isn’t the only player in this drama. The European Union cuts deals with African nations to catch fish to meet global demand it can no longer satisfy with fish from its own waters. American companies, which have seen some remarkable recovery of once-threatened coastal fish stocks after limiting catches, buy fish taken from far-off waters by Chinese and other vessels, much of it processed into pet food. Russia and Japan reap the world’s fish bounty as well.",
		"8" : "The good news, such as it is, is that some nations whose waters are at risk are rebelling, and the Chinese may slowly be getting the message. Indonesia has impounded scores of Chinese boats caught poaching in its waters, and Argentina sunk a Chinese vessel after it tried to ram a coast guard ship. There have been clashes between Chinese fishermen and the authorities in South Korea.",
		"9" : "China has pledged to cut fuel subsidies to its fleet by 60 percent by 2019. “The era of fishing any way you want, wherever you want, has passed,” says Liu Xinzhong, deputy general director of the Bureau of Fisheries in Beijing. In January, China’s Ministry of Agriculture announced measures aimed at protecting China’s own fisheries, including possible catch limits.",
		"10" : "That could eventually take some pressure off African and other international waters. So could the international compact known formally as the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which went into effect last year. The treaty seeks to identify fishing vessels, tracking where they fish and how much fish they are harvesting. The United States ratified the agreement in 2016. As of last week, 44 other countries and the European Union had also signed on.",
		"11" : "China, regrettably, has yet to do so. Beijing may be feeling the world’s censure. But it has a very long way to go before it becomes a responsible steward of the oceans’ threatened and not inexhaustible resources."

		"4" : "What is most impressive about Addams is that under the pressure of experience she grew into a political activist. She arrived at Hull House in 1889 an apolitical person, more interested in sharing the humanities than in advancing the labor movement or the women’s suffrage movement.",
		"5" : "She became the first truly national female political leader in American history, so famous and respected that Theodore Roosevelt considered naming her to his cabinet if he won the presidency in 1912 (she would have been the country’s first female cabinet member).",
		"6" : "Jane Addams fought for labor rights, immigrant rights, women’s rights and civil rights (she was a co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P.), and was a national leader of the international peace movement.",
		"7" : "It is her example as a social justice activist committed to grass-roots democracy that can teach us the most today.",

		"5" : "Career does not have to be at the expense of motherhood, and ambition is not reserved for the few aiming for the executive suite. Indeed, ambition must be redefined: Today’s most strategic, creative and ambitious women are also those who recognize that there are many paths to professional happiness when there is ample room to nurture and love not one but two jobs: caring for family and achieving financial security.",

It’s as if we were not Americans, as if black people must stay on the far side of an intellectual color bar marked “race” that blocks us from relevance as Americans, even when our experience might inform society as a whole.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Aaron Judge, a 25-year-old Yankees rookie, finally offered some evidence that he is, in fact, fallible. In the first inning of Wednesday night’s game against the Toronto Blue Jays, he was thrown out trying to steal a base.",
		"2" : "But aside from that, he continued to pile up numbers at so rapid a pace that it may be difficult for the average fan to keep track of them.",
		"3" : "The Yankees beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 8-6, yet another come-from-behind victory that was fueled by the team’s primary weapon this season: home runs. The long balls helped them stay close in a game in which they trailed by 4-0 after one inning and by 6-3 after three. Judge, unsurprisingly, produced one of the homers, a two-run shot to center field in the third inning.",
		"4" : "Judge’s home run was not the only one hit by the Yankees, or even the most important — that designation would go to Matt Holliday’s three-run shot in the first inning, which gave the Yankees a quick start on climbing out of the four-run hole that C. C. Sabathia had put them in in the top of the inning. Holliday’s home run was also the 300th of his 14-year major league career.",
		"5" : "But Judge’s added to the case that he might just be for real, that the 10 home runs he hit in April to help earn him the American League Rookie of the Month Award, announced earlier on Wednesday, might just be the start of something much bigger.",
		"6" : "As Sabathia succinctly put it, “he’s scary.”",
		"7" : "The home run — Judge’s 13th in just 88 at-bats this season, a pace that would put him in the neighborhood of 88 home runs over the course of a 600-at-bat season — was one of three hits he collected, a first for him in a major league game.",
		"8" : "Judge also scored the run that tied the game at 6-6 in an atypical small-ball rally by the Yankees in the seventh inning. Judge produced a one-out single off a 1-2 changeup, a pitch that might be expected to confound a young player who, in his first big league stint, showed an alarming tendency to strike out. But little has fazed Judge this time around.",
		"9" : "“Honestly, I just take it one day at a time,” he said Wednesday. “I try to forget what I did the day before. Every day is like opening day for me.”",
		"10" : "Judge singled to the opposite field in the first inning (and was thrown out trying to steal), homered in the third, popped out in the fifth and singled again in the seventh before striking out in the eighth.",
		"11" : "Although he has played down most of his achievements so far, he seems at least grudgingly aware of the significance of what he is doing as a player with not even 175 major league at-bats.",
		"12" : "Asked if he had ever been as hot as he is right now, at any level, Judge grinned and said, “Maybe in tee ball.”",
		"13" : "His teammates are not nearly so coy. “The only word I can use to describe him is ‘dominant,’” Chase Headley said. “He’s been pretty impressive to be around, and to be a part of it.”",
		"14" : "Manager Joe Girardi said: “I’ve said all along, if he gets the barrel of the bat to the ball, he’s going to do a lot of damage. We knew he was a good outfielder. We knew he could run the bases. But we wanted that consistent contact because when a man that size makes consistent contact, there’s going to be some damage. It’s hard to measure what he’s done for us in these first 20-something games.”",
		"15" : "Girardi argued balls and strikes so vociferously with the home-plate umpire, Bill Welke, that he was ejected early in the seventh inning. His tirade may have had an effect, though. Before the ejection, Blue Jays reliever Joe Biagini had struck out five straight Yankees, four of them looking. After the ejection, the next four Yankees — Judge, Headley, Chris Carter and pinch-hitter Didi Gregorius — got hits to give the Yankees a 7-6 lead. The final run was driven in with a bases-loaded walk by Aaron Hicks.",
		"16" : "That rally helped the Yankees overcome a second straight troubling effort by Sabathia, who surrendered a three-run homer to Steve Pearce on his 15th pitch of the game and left two batters into the fifth inning, having allowed six earned runs.",
		"17" : "“I have confidence in C. C.,” Girardi said. “He didn’t have his cutter tonight. But he’ll be fine.”",
		"18" : "No such reassurances were needed about Judge, who through the first 26 games of the season continues to affirm just how fine he is.",
		"19" : "As Headley said, “Judge has been out of this world.”",
		"20" : "So much so, the Yankees might want to erect a scoreboard dedicated only to him."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Twenty-seven games into the 2017 season, the Mets find themselves where they have been a number of times before. Once again, a series of injuries is undermining their ambitions and has left them facing renewed questions about how they try to keep players from being hurt and how they handle physical setbacks when they occur.",
		"2" : "If all of this seems familiar to frustrated Mets fans, it’s because it is. Even Sandy Alderson, the team’s general manager, acknowledges that.",
		"3" : "Alderson came aboard before the 2011 season, and on Monday reflected on how the team, in part, was perceived when he first took over.",
		"4" : "“That we have injuries, that we don’t explain injuries, that we’re too optimistic on when players will come back,” Alderson said.",
		"5" : "And yet, he added, “Here we are, seven years later, with the same accusations.”",
		"6" : "Actually, seven years does not capture how often the injury issue has driven the Mets to distraction in the last two decades. Late in 2004, for instance, after a season in which a still-emerging Jose Reyes spent what seemed like forever recovering from hamstring problems, the Mets made major changes to their training and medical staffs.",
		"7" : "An agreement with the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases was cut short. Instead, the Mets signed on with the Hospital for Special Surgery and turned back to Dr. David Altchek as the team’s medical director. Ray Ramirez was brought in as the new head trainer.",
		"8" : "That arrangement has remained ever since. It has not always been smooth sailing.",
		"9" : "In 2008 and 2010, the Mets had difficulty in quickly reacting to concussions suffered by outfielders Ryan Church and Jason Bay. Both continued to play when they shouldn’t have. Both ended up missing a considerable number of games.",
		"10" : "Also in 2010, the Mets and Scott Boras, the agent for outfielder Carlos Beltran, engaged in an unusual public skirmish after Beltran had arthroscopic surgery on his knee that the Mets said they did not approve.",
		"11" : "A year later, with Alderson in charge, David Wright, after playing in pain for weeks, was found to have a stress fracture in his back. He missed two months. In 2015, Steven Matz told the Mets he felt soreness after his major league debut, was allowed to make a second start, and then went on the disabled list for two months with a torn lat muscle, the injury now afflicting Noah Syndergaard.",
		"12" : "Every major league team, of course, deals with repeated injuries, and every team makes mistakes in trying to address them. In the marathon race that is the 162-game season, the sport becomes a battle of attrition. Virtually every fan base second-guesses its team’s medical staff, even booing the trainers on opening day, which has happened with the Mets.",
		"13" : "Two seasons ago, the Washington Nationals did what the Mets did in 2004, replacing their medical and training staffs after a 2015 campaign that was sideswiped by too many players being injured. At the time, Mike Rizzo, the general manager, said the team did so to adopt a more proactive and preventive approach.",
		"14" : "“It may be the next frontier, the next ‘Moneyball,’ keeping players on the field,” Rizzo said then.",
		"15" : "While Mets fans may think that their team is continually cursed with injuries, and there have been plenty of them, the numbers suggest that it could be worse.",
		"16" : "According to ManGamesLost.com, which keeps track of disabled-list transactions and day-to-day injuries, the Mets, from 2010 to 2016, had 5,545 instances in which players missed a game because of an injury. That left them ranked seventh out of 30 teams. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who won four straight National League West titles in that time, were first with 7,169.",
		"17" : "The teams that ranked between the Dodgers and the Mets — the Texas Rangers, the San Diego Padres, the Boston Red Sox, the Oakland Athletics and the Philadelphia Phillies — were a mix of successful and struggling franchises.",
		"18" : "That mix was even reflected by the Mets. When they reached the 2015 World Series, they finished the regular season with 1,332 instances in which an injured player sat out, the third-most in the majors, according to the website. Yet last season, when they overcame numerous ailments to key players to nab the top wild-card spot in the N.L., they ranked just 17th, with 886 instances of games missed.",
		"19" : "Even this season, amid the Mets’ mounting injuries, ManGamesLost.com calculated that the club ranked only 12th in baseball in that statistic up to last weekend.",
		"20" : "Where the Mets have endured the most aggravation, perhaps, is in the effects of their injuries. Nathan Currier, the founder of ManGamesLost.com, has created a statistic called Injury Impact to Team, and the figure shows that from 2010 to 2016, the Mets led baseball in this metric. The statistic uses wins above replacement to assign weight to the importance of the injured player.",
		"21" : "Injuries to Johan Santana, Matt Harvey, Wright, Matz, Beltran and Reyes probably had a good deal to do with the fact that the Mets were No. 1 in this category. And the team’s latest ranking this season does not include Syndergaard, the Mets’ ace, going down for what could be several months.",
		"22" : "Over the past week, Alderson has gone out of his way to address the injury issue, saying the Mets would have to re-evaluate everything they do in trying to keep their players from being hurt. He even cited the need to take a close look at the weight training, stretching and hydration regimens used by Yoenis Cespedes, now out with a hamstring injury.",
		"23" : "Alderson also said he has examined the number of days Mets players have been on the disabled list and — like ManGamesLost.com — notes that it is not far from the average. He has pointed out that the Mets have an older team — their position players average 30.1 years of age, the highest in the N.L. — and that can be a factor that leads to injuries.",
		"24" : "At the same time, Alderson has defended the Mets’ treatment of Cespedes, who was not put on the 10-day disabled list when he first hurt his hamstring and then strained the same hamstring more seriously when he returned to action five days later. Cespedes is expected to be out a few weeks.",
		"25" : "Alderson has also defended how the Mets handled Syndergaard, who declined to have a magnetic resonance imaging test after reporting some biceps discomfort and then ended up with a lat tear days later. Syndergaard will be out a lot longer than Cespedes.",
		"26" : "Cespedes thought he was ready to play, Syndergaard thought he was ready to pitch, and nobody on the Mets’ training and medical staff said they couldn’t. Indeed, the toughest part for a team and a player is determining how many aches and pains can be considered just part of the job and not something that requires an M.R.I. or a stay on the D.L. More than anything, players have to be truthful.",
		"27" : "“I don’t know if what they’re saying really coincides with how they really feel,” Manager Terry Collins said of his players.",
		"28" : "In that regard, Collins has tried to keep close tabs on shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera, who dealt with a knee injury for much of last season and landed briefly on the D.L. This season, Cabrera has had soreness near his knee, and Collins said he called Cabrera into his office frequently to ask if he needed rest.",
		"29" : "“If anybody thinks from what we said in spring training that is not our first priority, to make sure these guys are O.K., they’re crazy,” Collins said. “This is all we’ve harped on.”",
		"30" : "And yet the injuries mount. It is a tough spot to be in, and Alderson said that he did not try to make things sound better than they are. A 15-day injury estimate, he said, does not become 10 just to make things a little less depressing.",
		"31" : "“I try to give everybody the most current information I’ve got,” Alderson said. “If that changes, it changes. But I don’t have any real motive to be overly optimistic.”"

		"5" : "With a lineup featuring the future Hall of Fame slugger Harmon Killebrew; Tony Oliva, who won his second consecutive batting championship; and shortstop Zoilo Versalles, the league’s most valuable player that season, and with a pitching staff headed by Mudcat Grant and Jim Kaat and molded by Johnny Sain, one of the era’s finest pitching coaches, the Twins won the 1965 pennant with 102 victories.",
		"6" : "They were bested by the Los Angeles Dodgers in a seven-game World Series, but Mele was named the American League manager of the year by The Associated Press and The Sporting News.",
		"7" : "“Sam was perfect for us at that time,” Kaat told The St. Paul Pioneer Press when he attended a 50th anniversary reunion of that Twins team. “There wasn’t a lot of overmanaging in those days. They just threw the ball out and let you play, and Sam did that and it was the best thing for us.”",
		"8" : "The Twins won 89 games in 1966, finishing nine games behind the pennant-winning Baltimore Orioles. When they were off to a sluggish start in 1967, Mele was fired in June and replaced by Cal Ermer, a longtime minor league manager.",

		"10" : "Sabath Anthony Mele was born in Queens on Jan. 21, 1922, a son of Antonio Mele, who worked for Consolidated Edison, and his wife, Anna, both immigrants from Italy. He played baseball for Bryant High School in Queens, then became one of the leading collegiate hitters in the New York metropolitan area with N.Y.U. He was also selected for the area’s all-star basketball team as a 6-foot-1 guard for the Violets during World War II.",
		"11" : "Having enlisted in the Marine reserves in 1942, Mele was called into active service in July 1943 and entered Yale to join a Navy-Marine Corps training program for World War II service offered at colleges around the country. Students in the program were allowed to participate in athletics, so he played baseball for Yale in 1943 before leaving for wartime duty. He served on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific and played on military baseball teams. He was discharged from the Marines in 1946.",
		"12" : "Signed by the Red Sox for a reported $30,000 bonus, Mele made his debut for them in 1947. A right-handed batter, he hit .302 with 12 home runs and 73 runs batted in, usually playing right field.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "The Rangers needed a jolt for their first home game of their second-round series against the Ottawa Senators. Turning to Tanner Glass and his physical style, they may have found the catalyst.",
		"2" : "Glass was a decisive factor in the Rangers’ 4-1 win over the Senators in Game 3 on Tuesday. He hit nearly every Senator in sight without taking a penalty, and he helped set up a second-period goal by Oscar Lindberg that gave the Rangers a four-goal cushion. Glass’s energy seemed to lift the entire Rangers’ lineup as they dominated Ottawa start to finish after losing each of the first two games by a goal.",
		"3" : "“He is a true professional — the way he trains and the way he prepares,” Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist said. “He does his job really well, and the guys appreciate that. He wants to play with emotion and be physical. It’s huge for the team.”",
		"4" : "The Rangers played with a fresher and more focused approach in Game 3, much different from the tentative and often inconsistent style they displayed in the first two contests in Ottawa.",
		"5" : "Glass skated on a line with Lindberg and J. T. Miller that proved hard for the Senators to contain. All four Rangers lines contributed offensively Tuesday.",
		"6" : "“I bring a little bit of an edge,” Glass said. “I think the guys like that.”",
		"7" : "Glass spent most of the season with Hartford of the American Hockey League but was summoned to the Rangers in mid-March when they needed a physical player. Glass responded well in limited playoff duty, scoring the winning goal in the Rangers’ playoff opener in Montreal. He played the first three games against the Canadiens, but when the Rangers’ offense sputtered, he was benched in favor of the playmaking winger Pavel Buchnevich for the last three, and the opening games of the Ottawa series.",
		"8" : "After Game 2, during which Coach Alain Vigneault seemed to lose faith in some of his younger players, he again inserted Glass, who has played 64 playoff games in his career with the Rangers, Pittsburgh and Vancouver.",
		"9" : "“He never leaves a detail out of his game,” the Rangers captain Ryan McDonagh said of Glass. “You see him diving after a puck, which leads to Oscar’s goal. He blocks a huge shot” from Erik Karlsson.",
		"10" : "“He wants to do whatever he can to help us win a game,” McDonagh said.",
		"11" : "Glass, who reached the Stanley Cup finals with the Canucks under Vigneault, said he thrived in the postseason spotlight.",
		"12" : "“Playoffs are so much fun,” Glass said. “It’s a different element when you’re playing against the same guys every night. I just try to go out there and enjoy it.”",
		"13" : "The Rangers were also heartened to see Miller, who scored 22 goals during the regular season, finally emerge as a factor in a postseason game. Miller had only one assist in eight playoff games before he electrified the crowd at Madison Square Garden by weaving around several Senators late in the second period before passing the puck to Lindberg on the doorstep for an easy tap-in.",
		"14" : "The effort pleased the hard-working Lindberg, who picked up his first career postseason goal.",
		"15" : "“You can see how strong he is on the puck,” said Lindberg, a quiet force all season with eight goals and 12 assists. “J. T. is fun to play with. On my goal, he did all the work, and I was open.”",
		"16" : "Lindberg agreed that his line might have provided a spark for the squad. “The way we came out, we had a great first period,” he said. “There was energy from that, and we just kept playing. It was an extra boost for sure.”",
		"17" : "Glass said he felt an extra benefit from being reunited with Miller, with whom he skated on a checking line two years ago in a seven-game second-round series against the especially physical Washington Capitals.",
		"18" : "“Our games complement each other well,” Glass said. “He’s a guy who plays hard and can hang onto the puck and make plays.”",
		"19" : "As the Rangers try to tie the series at two games each on Thursday, they hope this most recent shuffle in the lineup continues to be effective.",
		"20" : "“It’s up to each individual to prepare for success,” Glass said. “We just want to be hard on the forecheck, hard to play against.”",
		"21" : "He added: “It’s like making deposits into a bank account: Keep hitting guys, and it will pay off later in the series. We have to play with the same urgency and desperation in Game 4.”",
		"22" : "SLAP SHOTS",
		"23" : "Senators Coach Guy Boucher said forwards Bobby Ryan and Zack Smith remained “day to day” after sustaining injuries in Game 3. Boucher said that he was considering dressing seven defensemen and 11 forwards for Game 4 and that forward Tom Pyatt and defenseman Chris Wideman could play."

		"1" : "MONACO — Gonzalo Higuaín scored twice, and the veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made some crucial saves as Juventus won, 2-0, at Monaco on Wednesday to take a commanding lead in their Champions League semifinal.",
		"2" : "Juventus gave a master class in how to withstand the pressure of Monaco’s potent attack and then punish on the counterattack, with both of Higuaín’s goals coming after impressive stretches of play by Monaco.",
		"3" : "“The job is not complete,” Juventus Coach Massimiliano Allegri said. “But this could become an extraordinary season for us.”",
		"4" : "Higuaín pounced in the 29th minute, side-footing the ball home. Dani Alves had latched on to his pass down the right side and back-heeled the ball to Higuaín, who was sprinting into the penalty area.",
		"5" : "Higuaín had not scored against Barcelona in the round of 16, leading some to question his transfer from Napoli — the deal an Italian record at roughly $98 million. After his first goal, he bounded over the advertisements lining the field to emphatically milk the applause from the traveling fans.",
		"6" : "Higuaín got his second goal in the 59th minute, sliding in to turn home a deep cross from the irrepressible Alves.",
		"7" : "Entering the game, Higuaín had scored only two goals in 24 games in the knockout stages of the competition — a poor return for a usually prolific striker.",
		"8" : "“Goals were not coming for me in this competition,” Higuaín said. “I knew I just had to stay calm and keep working hard.”",
		"9" : "Before Higuaín’s opener, the 18-year-old Monaco striker Kylian Mbappé forced two smart saves from the 39-year-old Buffon, who was making his 100th Champions League appearance for Juventus. Buffon also clawed away a header from center back Kamil Glik and, moments later, showed great composure in smothering a Radamel Falcao shot.",
		"10" : "Buffon saved his best for the last minute, showing remarkable athleticism in tipping a point-blank header from the substitute Valére Germain. Defender Giorgio Chiellini rushed over to hug Buffon at the final whistle.",
		"11" : "“He’s still No. 1 in the world,” Allegri said of Buffon. “He is always decisive in the big games.”",
		"12" : "The winner of the semifinal will play either Real Madrid or Atlético Madrid, with Real heading into the second leg ahead by 3-0 after Cristiano Ronaldo recorded a hat trick on Tuesday.",
		"13" : "This match was not so one-sided, but Monaco’s vaunted attack was blunted by a rock-solid defense that has conceded only two goals in 11 Champions League games.",
		"14" : "The sheer speed of Juventus’s approach play took Monaco by surprise, leading Coach Leonardo Jardim to frantically gesticulate to his players early to close down their opponents. Forward Paulo Dybala’s roaming around the field baffled Monaco, opening up space for Alves.",
		"15" : "Mbappé had Monaco’s first effort on target, heading the ball straight at Buffon off a Nabil Dirar cross. The two combined again moments later, with Buffon making a smart stop to deny Mbappé as he latched on to a low cross. Because the ball came in from the right, Mbappé could not open his foot enough to place the ball on either side of Buffon.",
		"16" : "As Monaco kept up the pressure, Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci intervened the rough way, hacking down Falcao near the halfway line and getting a yellow card.",
		"17" : "Monaco tore into Juventus after the break, but the wily Juventus defenders often had every angle covered — and Buffon was there when they did not.",
		"18" : "It was a brutal lesson for a young Monaco team that is rich on flair. But the experience of Juventus, a two-time champion that lost the 2015 final to Barcelona, seemed to separate the sides.",
		"19" : "The difference in composure was highlighted on the second goal. After defensive midfielder Tiemoué Bakayoko carelessly gave away the ball down the right, Alves moved into the space behind him. He patiently waited for Higuaín to change his initial run to the penalty spot and lofted over a precise pass that fell perfectly into Higuaín’s path at the back post."

		"2" : "The links that connect the teams are clear. Both clubs play in jerseys adorned with the logo of the energy-drink maker Red Bull. Both play in stadiums known as Red Bull Arena. And both are certain to be in Europe next season: RB Leipzig, whose rapid rise has angered fans of some of its Bundesliga rivals, should qualify automatically for the group stages of the Champions League, while Salzburg can seal its eighth Austrian championship in 11 years this weekend, and with it a spot in the tournament’s final qualifying round.",
		"3" : "But the corporate connections between the clubs seem to suggest Leipzig would not be permitted to enter the Champions League, or even the second-tier Europa League, if both teams qualified: Under UEFA statutes, teams owned by the same company, sponsor or individual — or those that share staff members or resources — are forbidden from taking part in the two continental competitions organized by European soccer’s governing body. Since some teams eliminated from the Champions League’s group stages drop into the Europa League’s later rounds, it is not enough that the two teams merely stay out of the same competition.",
		"4" : "Article 5 of UEFA’s regulations for the Champions League — titled “Integrity of the Competition” — states that in such circumstances, the team finishing higher in its domestic league would take precedence. That would mean Salzburg, as the Austrian champion, would be in and Leipzig, the runner-up in Germany, would be out. Salzburg has qualified for the Champions League for the past five years; each time, it has failed to advance to the group stage.",

		"10" : "Under Austria’s club licensing laws, only a nonprofit organization can obtain a league license, a spokesman for the country’s national league, the Bundesliga, confirmed. That nonprofit cannot be owned by a private individual or company. Sponsorships, as well as income streams like television rights and merchandising, are then run through a third company, connected to and controlled by the nonprofit.",
		"11" : "Although Red Bull unquestionably bankrolls Salzburg, just as it does Leipzig, the clubs believe the fact that it does not — in the strictest sense — own both teams means it will meet UEFA’s criteria when both apply for entry to the Champions League in June.",

RB Leipzig insisted that move was not made with Champions League qualification in mind.",
		"15" : "It is not the first case of this type UEFA has had to handle. In 1997, AEK Athens was prevented from entering the UEFA Cup, the forerunner of the Europa League, because it and another team in the field, Slavia Prague, were owned by the investment vehicle ENIC. In 2001, the French television conglomerate Canal+ had to sell its interest in the Swiss team Servette to allow its other, more prominent club, Paris St.-Germain, to enter the same tournament."

		"1" : "You want to throw more accurately? Throw softer.",
		"2" : "That’s one of the takeaways from a new study by Yale and Harvard professors on the physics of throwing. The findings might interest quarterbacks, dunking booth participants and anyone throwing wadded-up paper into a wastebasket. If you’re missing a lot, try throwing a little slower.",
		"3" : "The paper, published last week in Royal Society Open Science, is not likely to take the sports world by storm, with its talk of the “dynamics of the projectile” and “propagating distributions with non-infinitesimal variance.” But inside is quite a bit of solid advice for athletes who throw things.",
		"4" : "It is well known that there is a trade-off between throwing fast and throwing accurately. A reason for this, many people believed, was that throwing fast made it harder to release the object at just the right moment.",
		"5" : "But the study finds that even after the object is released, faster throws are less accurate. “The speed at which you throw the ball affects the curvature of the trajectory the ball takes,” said one of the authors, Madhusudhan Venkadesan of Yale.",
		"6" : "This effect is so pronounced that the study advises those seeking accuracy to throw as slowly as possible while still reaching their target.",
		"7" : "The professors, Venkadesan and Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan of Harvard, did not line up dozens of undergraduates with baseballs and javelins for the study. Instead, their conclusions are based on mathematical modeling.",
		"8" : "“What our work adds is a physics basis for why there is a speed/accuracy contrast,” Venkadesan said.",
		"9" : "But they also compared their findings with data taken from athletes and found that the figures matched nicely.",
		"10" : "For example, the study suggests that the optimal speed for a thrown dart is 5.1 to 5.5 meters per second. Typical dart throwers toss at an average speed of 5.8 to 6.7 meters per second, not far off.",
		"11" : "Again, slowness pays off. Of the suggested speed, Venkadesan said, “That’s about as slow as you can throw while still sticking the dart in the board.” If the throw was any slower it “would completely miss the board, or it is going to enter at a very glancing blow.”",
		"12" : "Humans tend to have discovered, without doing any math, the correct speeds to throw in sport after sport. “By trial and error, people learn what to do,” Venkadesan said. “We have the ability to learn. We learn over one lifetime: Babies start throwing and get feedback.”",
		"13" : "One reason humans are so good at throwing may be that for tens of thousands of years they relied heavily on hunting for survival. “Hunting is a big part of the story,” Venkadesan said. “In the context of hunting, being fast and accurate is a challenging thing.”",
		"14" : "Though we think of cave men hunting with spears, there is evidence that earlier hunting relied on throwing rocks. Getting the mechanics of throwing right could have been the difference between a protein-rich dinner and hunger.",
		"15" : "And humans have unusually good throwing abilities. “Chimpanzees are slow and not accurate,” Venkadesan said. “They can barely throw as fast as a 10-year-old human.”",
		"16" : "The researchers found one exception to the “slower is better” rule: cricket. When players are trying to hit the wicket — a small vertical target — to get a run out, “the best way is an underhand throw as fast as you can,” Venkadesan said. “It comes out of the math.”",
		"17" : "The rule also might not be of much use in baseball and other sports in which someone is trying to hit the ball. Although slower pitches would be more accurate, they would also be easier to clobber into the bleachers — unless they curve or slide or knuckle, of course.",
		"18" : "The professors offer some unorthodox basketball advice: Consider throwing free throws underhanded.",
		"19" : "“The underarm throw is marginally better for an average N.B.A. player,” the paper said. The professors suggest that the reason more players have not tried the style is simply societal pressure — it looks kind of silly."

		"1" : "Terry Crews has an enviable résumé: former professional football player; actor on “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”; star in the “Expendables” movie franchise; and, according to People magazine, one of the sexiest men alive.",
		"2" : "But there’s a new job title that he finds especially thrilling: furniture designer.",
		"3" : "“There’s nothing more satisfying,” Mr. Crews said, discussing his first collection of furniture for Bernhardt Design, which will be presented during the ICFF furniture fair in New York later this month. “I want something beautiful. I want something special. I want to see something that I did with my own hands that touches the world.”",
		"4" : "The brawny Mr. Crews has long had a creative side. He studied graphic design at Western Michigan University on an art scholarship. As a player in the National Football League, he painted portraits of teammates for about $5,000 each to make ends meet when he was cut from teams. After retiring from football, he tried to get a job as an animator. That didn’t work out, but he began acting — and that did.",
		"5" : "In recent years, he has also developed an irrepressible passion for design. Mr. Crews speaks about his April 2016 trip to the Salone del Mobile design fair in Milan the way other people may talk about attending Vanity Fair’s Oscar party.",
		"6" : "“I remember meeting David Weeks, Marc Thorpe and hanging with Bjarke Ingels at Bar Basso in Milan — and me and Bjarke having this huge talk about architecture,” Mr. Crews said. “It was like ‘Oh, my God, I’m hanging with the people who are going to be responsible for how the world looks over the next 30 years!’”",
		"7" : "Weeks later, he visited NYCxDesign, where he met Jerry Helling, the president of Bernhardt Design. Upon learning of Mr. Crews’s artistic background, Mr. Helling proposed a collaboration.",
		"8" : "The resulting collection comprises three designs inspired by ancient Egypt: the Ibis sofa, which has a long, shapely back recalling outstretched wings; tables named Float with smooth, rounded edges resembling pebbles softened by the Nile River; and the Lily Pad chair, which blossoms with a seat and tabletop on a single elevated platform.",
		"9" : "“Terry’s sofa is the best thing we’ve ever done,” Mr. Helling said. Coming from a man who has spent years working with design luminaries like Yves Béhar, Ross Lovegrove and Jaime Hayon, it’s a significant statement.",
		"10" : "But Mr. Crews is not the only successful creative professional from another field to recently turn his attention to designing furniture and home accessories. When fashion designers cross over, it seems more natural. Raf Simons released new upholstery fabric, throws and pillows for Kvadrat in March. Badgley Mischka introduced a furniture collection during New York Fashion Week in February.",
		"11" : "But actors and singers? Ellen DeGeneres introduced a line of furniture for Thomasville and a collection of rugs and pillows for Loloi earlier this year, and has curated an exhibition at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. Brad Pitt is at work on a second furniture collection with Pollaro after releasing his first range in 2012. Lenny Kravitz designed door levers and cabinet pulls for Rocky Mountain Hardware and a furniture collection for CB2. Kanye West has even expressed a desire to design for Ikea.",
		"12" : "Suddenly, it seems, designing furniture and objects for the home is the most coveted job around.",
		"13" : "At Bernhardt, Mr. Helling has also developed new upholstery fabrics with singer and songwriter Tift Merritt. The upside of working with such unconventional designers, he said, goes well beyond the marketing boost that comes with a celebrity name (although that can’t hurt).",
		"14" : "Unlike experienced professionals, “They don’t know all the things that they’re not supposed to do,” Mr. Helling said. “It’s a clean slate. It comes from their heart, rather than being an academic exercise.”",
		"15" : "Why would highly accomplished individuals from other creative fields bother with designing furniture and fabrics?",
		"16" : "“It’s just so exciting to see an idea come to life,” said Ms. Merritt, who collects vintage ribbon and has used some to make her own guitar straps.",
		"17" : "Mr. Helling is a longtime fan of Ms. Merritt’s music, and every time they met, “He always wanted to talk music, and I always wanted to talk design,” she said. “I had been hoping for many years that he might give me a shot at making something.”",
		"18" : "When he finally did, she used her ribbon collection as inspiration for a line of six striped fabrics with names like Verse, Reverb and Swing.",
		"19" : "Such cross-disciplinary design collaborations are increasingly common, said Joel Towers, executive dean of Parsons School of Design. “There’s a real breakdown in boundaries,” he said, where creative people are no longer expected to stick to their specialties. “Some of these people are performers who really understand their audience and the sense of what people desire. These are all key components of design.”",
		"20" : "He also pointed to social media, where celebrities often share pictures of their homes and personal style choices. The idea that people can then get involved in designing those style choices “feels very much of our time,” he said. “It’s about design being more democratized.”",
		"21" : "Indeed, when Mr. Kravitz, who founded Kravitz Design in 2003, speaks about design, he frequently does so in a very personal way. “The products I design I do use,” he said. “It’s very rare that Kravitz Design does something and I don’t have a piece in one of my homes. It’s very important to me.”",
		"22" : "That intimate approach has led to products like Mr. Kravitz’s Trousdale collection for Rocky Mountain Hardware, which includes rectangular door levers and pulls with a deeply pitted surface inspired by one of his belt buckles. “It’s a different, edgy, modern look — more so than other things we’ve done,” said Christian Nickum, the chief executive of Rocky Mountain Hardware. “It’s enlightened our customers to some of the different designs that we can create.”",
		"23" : "That growing diversity of voices in design is something new, said Cara McCarty, the curatorial director of the Cooper Hewitt. “What’s really interesting about design now is that there are so many different styles, not one dominant style,” she said.",
		"24" : "The Cooper Hewitt is hosting the exhibition “Ellen DeGeneres Selects,” which features the talk show host’s favorite objects from the museum’s collection, through May 21. It is also at work on a similar exhibition with the musician Esperanza Spalding scheduled to open June 9.",
		"25" : "“Many of these people have well-developed visual interests,” Ms. McCarty said, which makes the move into furniture design almost natural. “Just think of the design of their stage sets, the clothing, the music. It’s all part of a look and an identity.”",
		"26" : "At Kvadrat, a Danish textile company specializing in fabrics for upholstery and drapery, the idea to partner with Raf Simons grew out of the fashion designer’s decision to use the company’s fabrics in his 2011 fall/winter collection for Jil Sander.",
		"27" : "“When you work in industrial design and interior design, you’re pretty disciplined, and programmed in what’s right and what’s wrong,” said Anders Byriel, the chief executive of Kvadrat. “We wanted to create a space that was a little more freethinking.”",
		"28" : "Since 2014, Mr. Simons, who is now the chief creative officer of Calvin Klein, has designed four collections for Kvadrat with fabrics featuring beautiful blends of color and texture that have a depth rarely seen in furniture. His new Ria range, for instance, has a lively mottled appearance inspired by pointillist paintings.",
		"29" : "“In a way, it merges interiors with haute couture,” Mr. Byriel said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Karl Lagerfeld may have hoped for blazing sunshine and Aegean blue skies in Paris. After all, he staged Chanel’s 2018 cruise show, inspired by the glories of ancient Greece, under the rounded glass ceiling of the Grand Palais. His models wore gold: gilded laurels swirled into sunglasses, Delphos-pleated dresses corded with sequins, even beach cover-ups licked with golden vines. King Midas has nothing on Kaiser Karl.",
		"2" : "But alas, it was Paris in May. The sky was a sullen shade of Elgin-marble gray on Wednesday.",
		"3" : "The weather was, perhaps, the only factor Chanel couldn’t control. Rather than going to Greece, the fashion house brought Greece to Paris. What could be a larger display of its might? Perhaps presenting the collection in Greece itself; Mr. Lagerfeld had originally wanted to show at a historic venue, but was vetoed by the country’s officials, company representatives said. Hence the decision to show in Paris. (Earlier this year, the Central Archaeological Council in Athens also publicly rebuffed Gucci in its bid to stage its cruise show on the Acropolis. Instead it will be held in Florence.)",
		"4" : "No matter. Instead of showing amid the original ruins, Chanel spent a king’s ransom erecting its own. The set was based on the Parthenon as well as the Temple of Poseidon on Cape Sounion. It took 50 craftspeople three weeks of construction, and nine days of assembly, to complete.",
		"5" : "Ideologically, Mr. Lagerfeld asserted that his re-creation was conceptual: “Reality is of no interest to me,” he said. “I use what I like. My Greece is an idea.”",
		"6" : "“It’s his dream of the ideal,” said Lady Amanda Harlech, Chanel’s creative consultant. “But he wanted it to look modern, modern, modern.” The cash-strapped status of modern Greece makes, perhaps, for an odd allusion when a cruise collection is involved. Though the show was held in Paris, Chanel’s homeland, it wasn’t Chanel on the cheap; there was, of course, no reason for it to be. Although Chanel is privately owned and its financial figures are not released, last year Forbes estimated the brand’s value to be around $7.2 billion, against annual sales of $5.2 billion.",
		"7" : "Falling between the traditional fall/winter and spring/summer seasons, the cruise season — and its late-summer counterpart, pre-fall — accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of designer clothing sales. They are ostensibly interim collections, but Lagerfeld can be credited with making the cruise season visible and commercially important. Later this month, Louis Vuitton will present its collection in Kyoto, Christian Dior in Los Angeles, Gucci in Florence and Prada, for the first time, in Milan.",
		"8" : "Greece in the Grand Palais seems tame next to those locations. But Mr. Lagerfeld’s initial inspiration came from even closer to home: a first century B.C. statue of Venus in Gabrielle Chanel’s Rue Cambon apartment, above Chanel’s flagship boutique. That led him to think about ancient times, and the “modernity of antiquity,” words he chose as the title of the collection. The theme was evident in various forms. Neo-Classical dance and the attire of Isadora Duncan were also cited as influences.",
		"9" : "There was a Cecil B. DeMille-like quality to the painstakingly recreated ruins and the painted sunset backdrop, around which the models meandered in draped jersey dresses that scrambled perceptions of time. They suggested the Greek goddesses found on a 1930s Hollywood studio lot, the plissé gowns of Madame Grès, or the Dionysian revels of Studio 54.",
		"10" : "Just as Michel Gaubert’s soundtrack combined the cerebral compositions of Iannis Xenakis alongside the campy tracks of the Greek prog-rock band Aphrodite’s Child, Mr. Lagerfeld’s clothes were Greece, remixed, a sprint of Olympian proportions through Ionic iconography. There were amphora-shaped dresses of compressed pleats, draped chiffon pieces corseted with “cracked” marble and sandals with columns as heels. So far, not so Coco.",
		"11" : "And yet there was something that gave the entire offering a distinctly Chanel handwriting. The collection opened with a sequence of hairy, fraying tweeds in Chanel colors like tobacco, caramel and beige. There were also the shades of ancient Greece, but these clothes didn’t feel mired in costume drama. Ignore the columns and ditch the togas, and this show was fluid, light and right for right now. As Mr. Lagerfeld himself put it: “To create the future, you have to pay attention to the past.”"

	"content" : {
		"1" : "SAN FRANCISCO — While on the campaign trail last year, Donald J. Trump lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and set his sights on companies like Apple to help rectify the situation. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” he said.",
		"2" : "On Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet President Trump halfway.",
		"3" : "While it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of manufacturing jobs, Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, said it planned to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund later this month.",
		"4" : "The fund “can be the ripple in the pond,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said during an interview with CNBC in which he announced the new fund. “Those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.”",
		"5" : "In introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs — many of them related to manufacturing — in the United States.",
		"6" : "Carrier, a furnace maker that had been excoriated by Mr. Trump for potentially outsourcing jobs to Mexico, decided to keep 800 of 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. SoftBank, a Japanese company that has invested in many businesses worldwide, told Mr. Trump it would use a $100 billion technology fund to create 50,000 American jobs. This week, Infosys, a tech outsourcing company based in India, said it would hire up to 10,000 American workers.",
		"7" : "Some critics have suggested the Trump administration is too focused on manufacturing, as opposed to more quickly cultivating service occupations — in the leisure and hospitality or health care industries, for instance.",
		"8" : "But for the roughly two-thirds of Americans who lack a four-year college degree, manufacturing remains one of the few sectors that can deliver a middle-class income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical factory worker earns more than $26 an hour, compared with $14 an hour for the average hotel and food services employee.",
		"9" : "Even if more manufacturing jobs are created, however, there may be too few Americans with manufacturing skills to fill them. LinkedIn’s most recent monthly report on employment trends found there were not enough people with manufacturing skills in areas like New York City, Los Angeles and Denver, which lack the industrial bases found in cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Many high school graduates avoided going into the sector in recent decades as it shed jobs, creating a labor shortage as older workers retire.",
		"10" : "Apple’s focus with its new fund is on a slice of the industry known as advanced manufacturing. That is a catchall term, but typically it involves the production of high-value-added products in sectors like technology, aerospace, automobiles, sustainable energy and medical equipment. In some cases, that means making much smaller batches than mass-production-oriented assembly lines churn out, or using robotics and 3-D printing to create bespoke items.",
		"11" : "Mr. Cook’s announcement of the new fund came midway through his interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC, when he was asked what he was doing to create jobs. Mr. Cook answered that Apple gave back in job creation and that the company had asked itself, “How can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?”",
		"12" : "Mr. Cook did not address whether the fund was influenced by Mr. Trump’s policies and statements on manufacturing.",
		"13" : "Asked by Mr. Cramer about working with the president, Mr. Cook said there were always issues to agree on and disagree on with any administration in any country. But “you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don’t,” he said.",
		"14" : "Mr. Cook added that Apple would announce initiatives to support its current employees and add to their ranks, and to aid the software developers who make apps for Apple’s phones, watches and computers.",
		"15" : "Apple, which reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, so a $1 billion fund is relatively paltry for the company. Much of Apple’s cash is held overseas, but Mr. Cook told CNBC that the money the company was using for the fund is “U.S. money.”",
		"16" : "An Apple spokesman said he did not have anything to add beyond what Mr. Cook said during the interview.",
		"17" : "Apple buttressed the announcement of the $1 billion fund with a  webpage focused on job creation late on Wednesday. On its site, Apple highlighted a 19-year track record of American job creation, including how the company had grown to 80,000 employees in the United States since 1998, from 5,000, in part thanks to its sprawling retail operation."

		"6" : "More broadly, the company has been criticized for doing a poor job weeding out content that violates its rules, including the sharing of nude photographs of female Marines without their consent and illegal gun sales.",
		"7" : "Facebook is also grappling with the limitations of its automated algorithms on other fronts, from the prevalence of fake news on the service to a News Feed that tends to show people information that reinforces their views rather than challenges them.",
		"8" : "Despite Mr. Zuckerberg’s pledge to do a better job in screening content, many Facebook users did not seem to believe that much would change. Hundreds of commenters on Mr. Zuckerberg’s post related personal experiences of reporting inappropriate content to Facebook that the company declined to remove.",
		"9" : "Most of the company’s reviewers are low-paid contractors overseas who spend on average of just a few seconds on each post. A National Public Radio investigation last year found that they inconsistently apply Facebook’s standards, echoing previous research by other outlets.",

		"12" : "Facebook has no intention of dialing back its promotion of video, including Live, telling investors on a conference call Wednesday that it would continue to rank it high in users’ news feeds and add more advertising within live videos and clips.",
		"13" : "Advertising is Facebook’s lifeblood, accounting for most of the company’s revenue and profit. In the first quarter, the company earned $3.1 billion, up 76 percent from the previous year.",
		"14" : "Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, said that all the negative publicity about Facebook’s problems with horrific content and fake news appears to have hurt user satisfaction levels. Adding more content monitors is aimed at reassuring Facebook’s 1.94 billion users, she said.",
		"15" : "“If people feel safe on Facebook, they will be more engaged and will use it more often,” Ms. Williamson said. “And if they use it more often, there will be more inventory for advertising.”",
		"16" : "The company is trying to strike a balance between censorship and free speech. Facebook video has been used to share millions of personal stories and to document events of immense public interest, such as a series of police shootings of unarmed black men that sparked a national conversation about race and law enforcement.",
		"17" : "Although there is little question that live-streamed murder does not belong on the service, the company has come under fire when it has stopped violent broadcasts like Korryn Gaines’s fatal standoff with police in Maryland last year.",
		"18" : "“All policies need to recognize that distressing speech is sometimes the most important to a public conversation,” said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who works on free speech issues.",
		"19" : "She said that the decision to hire more moderators can only help the company make better judgments, especially about live events where fast decisions can be critical. “Humans tend to have more nuance and context than an algorithm,” Ms. Rowland said.",
		"20" : "But Ms. Rowland said Facebook must also be more clear to the public about its rules on making those calls.",
		"21" : "Mr. Zuckerberg called the recent episodes of violence “heartbreaking” and said the company wanted to make it simpler and faster for reviewers to spot problems and call in law enforcement when needed.",
		"22" : "In the conference call with investors, he said that artificial intelligence tools would eventually allow reviewers to do a better job of reviewing content. “No matter how many people we have on the team, we’ll never be able to look at everything,” he said.",
		"23" : "Facebook is not the only internet company to wrestle with these problems. Google has struggled with similar issues involving its YouTube video service and an automated advertising system that sometimes places marketers’ ads next to questionable content.",
		"24" : "Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in an interview this week that like Facebook, his company believed the internet was so vast that machine learning had to work hand-in-hand with human reviewers to improve vetting.",

		"1" : "Every year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.",
		"2" : "And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.",
		"3" : "This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.",
		"4" : "At the moment, the internet isn’t in a good place. The Frightful Five — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — control nearly everything of value in the digital world, including operating systems, app stores, browsers, cloud storage infrastructure, and oceans of data from which to spin new products. A handful of others — Comcast, AT&T, Verizon — control the wired and wireless connections through which all your data flows. People used to talk about the internet as a wonderland for innovative upstarts, but lately the upstarts keep getting clobbered. Today the internet is gigantic corporations, all the way down.",
		"5" : "Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online — it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.",
		"6" : "Amid many legal battles, neutrality rules in some form have governed the internet for years. In 2015, after President Obama advocated a stricter policy, Tom Wheeler, then chairman of the F.C.C., pushed through sweeping network neutrality rules. But under President Trump, net neutrality is on the chopping block. Last week, Mr. Pai outlined an effort to loosen the rules; his vision is likely to come to pass.",
		"7" : "The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies — between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai’s speech, while the Internet Association — a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google — opposed it.",
		"8" : "Yet the portrayal of a fight along internet-versus-telecom battle lines seems increasingly simplistic. Telecom companies are becoming internet companies (Verizon now owns AOL and Yahoo), internet companies are dabbling in telecom (Alphabet has a fiber-optic internet service arm), and they’re all becoming film and TV studios (Amazon has an Emmys strategy!).",
		"9" : "So the better way to think about the rules isn’t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?",
		"10" : "Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.",
		"11" : "Tim Wu, the Columbia Law professor and New York Times contributing opinion columnist who developed the concept of “network neutrality,” said that the emergence of a handful of internet giants has altered how he thinks about the issue. In 2003, when he began arguing for neutrality rules, Mr. Wu was mainly interested in protecting digital innovators from the telecom oligopolies that had long stifled new technology on their networks. If phone companies brought the same rules from phone networks over to the internet, attaching unapproved hardware to your line (like a Wi-Fi router) or running software that might compete with the phone company’s primary business (say, Skype) could be deemed verboten.",
		"12" : "But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose — protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.",
		"13" : "“In the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,” he said. “Now it’s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.”",
		"14" : "To see what he means, consider that today’s internet giants have lots of ways to insulate themselves from competition. First, anytime competitors succeed, the giants usually also do well — they get rents from app store revenue, from cloud storage bills and from app-install ads, among other things. And when upstarts come along with services that threaten the Five’s businesses, the giants can simply copy them, and bundle their own versions with their popular products. See how Apple launched its own streaming service to compete with Spotify, or how Facebook copied all of Snapchat’s most popular features.",
		"15" : "But Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people’s phones.",
		"16" : "“Snapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,” Mr. Wu said. “Facebook hasn’t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?”",
		"17" : "The internet giants — who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules — don’t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.",
		"18" : "“Internet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,” Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: “Silicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.”",
		"19" : "Meanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite — that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.",
		"20" : "“The big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they’ve built out massive online infrastructure,” said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “But the upstart that doesn’t have the massive infrastructure and doesn’t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.”",
		"21" : "In other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.",
		"22" : "Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson’s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival’s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.",
		"23" : "“The basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn’t just exclude rivals in this way,” he said.",
		"24" : "I’m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants — and most other companies — on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that’s going to change under President Trump.",
		"25" : "The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we’ll be removing another check on their untamed power."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "Robot vacuum cleaners strike me as an essential appliance for our busy modern lives. The Roomba, made by iRobot, has been my choice. But Liam McCabe, a senior writer at The Wirecutter and Sweethome, the New York Times sites that evaluate products, has been testing these things since 2013 and says there is now a better option.",
		"2" : "Was the displacement of a Roomba by a rival a really big deal?",
		"3" : "It was pretty surprising. The Roomba 650 had been the pick since we first had a robot vacuum guide, back in 2012. It was the lowest-cost bot that didn’t usually get stuck, and was also strong enough to pick up most of the noticeable debris on most floors. They just got undercut. (iRobot this week replaced the Roomba 650 with the Roomba 690, essentially the same robot but now compatible with Alexa and a phone app.)",
		"4" : "How so?",
		"5" : "The secret to the Roomba 650 was the navigation. All the other cheap competitors up until recently had poor navigation. They’d get stuck on really basic obstacles like any kind of carpet fringe or stray cable, or just bop around in circles not cleaning anything. A lot of them didn’t even have brush rollers, so they didn’t do much on carpets.",
		"6" : "But then a batch of pretty good cheap models popped up. It sort of surprised us.",
		"7" : "So why did the Eufy RoboVac 11 win?",
		"8" : "It navigates just about as well as the Roomba 650 — not exactly the same behavior, but pretty close. It’s less likely to get caught on cords but slightly more likely to struggle crossing thresholds. On balance, it’s really pretty similar.",
		"9" : "And it is cheaper?",
		"10" : "At least $80 cheaper and it’s sometimes closer to $200 cheaper, depending on sale prices. The Roomba 650 can still cost $375. Sometimes the Eufy is $185-ish.",
		"11" : "I will say that iRobot, the maker of Roombas, is really good about supporting its old products. I’m not sure if Eufy and some of these other low-cost brands will support their robots the way that iRobot has. But Eufy is a sub-brand of Anker, which has so far been very good at supporting its products.",
		"12" : "The robots wear out faster than human-driven vacuums. Why?",
		"13" : "Vacuums, in general, have a tough job. They’re picking up grime and grit that can wear on mechanical parts. The robovacs are battery powered, so that’s always a failure point. And compared to cordless human-driven vacuums, they spend more time running, so the batteries wear out in fewer uses. When you vacuum by hand, I think the average is something like 25 minutes per week, but if you run a Roomba three times a week, that’s already three hours, minimum.",
		"14" : "How did you reach the conclusion that the Eufy is the best bet?",
		"15" : "So I test these at home. First, I let the bots loose and try to see what they struggle with. Then I purposely set up an obstacle course. I have this Turkish-style area rug that can be pretty challenging for bots, because the edges don’t sit flush with the floor anymore; it’s not rubber-backed, so it can get pushed around; and it has tassels on the ends.",
		"16" : "(You can see a GIF of it in the current guide.)",
		"17" : "That can winnow out some models pretty quickly.",
		"18" : "I test for small-particle pickup: baby powder and crumbs. Some of the weaker bots can struggle to pick those up. I also set up tightly arranged chairs because some bots can struggle to navigate around the legs effectively, or they just go around without going under them, leaving debris behind. I tie different USB and charging cords to the legs of those chairs and lay a power cable across the floor to see if they get caught.",
		"19" : "What about pet hair?",
		"20" : "I don’t include pet hair in the obstacle course because in my experience, most bots can get most pet hair off the floor. Sometimes it ends up wrapped around the brush rather than in the bin, but I can pretty much figure out what I need to know about the pet hair performance just by looking at the design of the brush roll.",
		"21" : "Are you a neat freak? You must have the world’s cleanest house.",
		"22" : "The thing is, I need to let it get kind of dirty to see how well the vacuums work."

		"2" : "That was clear in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday as the two companies clashed at a crucial hearing in a case that could halt the progress of Uber’s autonomous-vehicle research efforts. The hearing was expected to be the final court session before a federal judge decides whether to temporarily shut down Uber’s work on self-driving cars.",
		"3" : "At the center of the dispute are allegations by Waymo, the self-driving car unit spun off by Google’s parent company, that Uber was using stolen trade secrets to develop autonomous vehicles.",
		"4" : "The thief, Waymo maintains, is Anthony Levandowski, a former top Google engineer whose start-up was acquired by Uber last year to work on self-driving technology. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of illegally downloading 14,000 documents from Google and then applying those stolen secrets at Uber.",
		"5" : "On Wednesday, lawyers for Waymo argued that Mr. Levandowski had reached an understanding with Uber before he left Google. To keep that agreement secret from Google, the Waymo lawyers said, Mr. Levandowski and Uber needed some cover, so they hatched a plan for Mr. Levandowski to create a self-driving-car start-up named Otto, which Uber would then acquire.",
		"6" : "“In fact, there was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Mr. Levandowski had a deal,” Charles Verhoeven, a lawyer for Waymo, said.",
		"7" : "Uber, which has denied stealing Waymo’s technology, said there was no evidence that any stolen Waymo files had touched Uber’s servers.",
		"8" : "“We’ve interviewed more than 85 Uber employees, and more than 40 attorneys spent more than 6,000 hours reviewing documents, including over weekends,” Arturo Gonzalez, a lawyer for Uber, said. “After reviewing more than 300,000 documents, we’ve only found one Google email in the files.”",
		"9" : "The case will be decided by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court, who is expected to issue a ruling within the week. Waymo has asked for a temporary injunction blocking Uber’s self-driving car efforts; such an order would affect hundreds of Uber’s highly skilled engineers.",
		"10" : "At stake is what Uber and Waymo both believe could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the transportation industry in which autonomous cars move people around without the need or expense of human drivers.",
		"11" : "The two companies have been regarded as leaders in driverless technology, a field that has become crowded in recent years as Apple, General Motors, Tesla and dozens of other companies have flooded in. More than 30 companies have applied to test driverless cars in California, which is at the forefront of addressing regulatory issues raised by such vehicles.",
		"12" : "There has been little love between Uber and Google in the past, with the companies tangling over issues like mapping technology and hiring. Waymo’s lawsuit against Uber is one of the most tangible manifestations of the enmity between the two.",
		"13" : "Waymo, which was spun off by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, last year, sued Uber in February. Uber has repeatedly denied the accusations and has separately sought to take the matter to arbitration. Mr. Levandowski said last week that he would stop working on Uber’s Lidar system — a shorthand term for light detection and ranging technology, a key hardware component in the operation of autonomous vehicles — for the duration of the case.",
		"14" : "Waymo’s lawyers opened the proceedings on Wednesday by pointing to documents and emails uncovered during the case. The documents include correspondence between Uber executives discussing the acquisition of Mr. Levandowski’s start-up in early 2016 while he was still working for Google, Waymo’s lawyers said.",
		"15" : "The documents also show Uber agreeing to grant Mr. Levandowski more than 5.3 million company shares, with an estimated value of more than $250 million, in exchange for meeting various technical milestones and project goals should he join Uber.",
		"16" : "Uber’s lawyers argued there was no proof that the company had used any Waymo trade secrets.",
		"17" : "Judge Alsup said Wednesday that Waymo’s lawyers had presented strong evidence that Mr. Levandowski had downloaded troves of valuable information from Google before leaving the company and had tried to erase his tracks after doing so. He also said Uber had determined at some point that Mr. Levandowski was “radioactive” and had taken steps to insulate itself from any repercussions he might face.",
		"18" : "Yet Judge Alsup also indicated that Waymo’s lawyers might not have proved that there was a direct link between Mr. Levandowski’s actions and Uber’s products.",
		"19" : "“I’ve already given you lots of time for discovery, and you don’t seem to have a smoking gun,” he said to Waymo’s lawyers.",
		"20" : "Waymo’s lawyers said they believed that there might be additional evidence that Mr. Levandowski had shared the company’s technology with Uber and had used it in Uber designs, but that Uber was withholding that evidence.",

This sparkling, impeccably staged play — produced by the Cahoots Theater Company, the Other Cheek and Park Theater as part of 59E59’s Brits Off Broadway program — will be catnip to “Downton Abbey” devotees, with equal doses of humor and insight.",
		"2" : "This being a social mosaic of sorts, plot threads and characters abound, so bear with me. It begins with the harried Lord Kettlewell (Brian Protheroe), who is having a stressful Saturday. The Great Depression is afoot, and “strictly speaking, there isn’t a money market any longer,” he says, adding, “Take America.” And his long-absent daughter, Pamela (Emily Laing), an Oxonian returning to Britain from time abroad in Russia (working for the Red October Candy Factory), has arrived unexpectedly with a friend, the slovenly Comrade Staggles (Steven Blakeley), another British Communist.",
		"3" : "Attired in gender-neutral proletarian garb, the headstrong Pamela thinks it’s time to return to the nest, but Lord Kettlewell, separated from Pamela’s mother, Lady Kettlewell (Lisa Bowerman), is skeptical. Fortunately, a good friend — the acerbic, mildly effeminate Churton Saunders (a delightfully droll Hugh Sachs), called Chuffy — is there to offer counsel and sympathy.",
		"4" : "Still with me? Because Lord Kettlewell’s day is just beginning. Lady Knightsbridge (Richenda Carey) — a sniffling hen shorn of her wealth, soliciting employment for her newly strapped upper-crust friends — has invited herself over for lunch. (“Communists, eh?” she asks Lord Kettlewell. “Is there any money in it?”) Also on hand is Farrington Gurney (Charlie Field), a young, aggressive capitalist who covets Pamela. And Lord Kettlewell’s mistress, Hilda Lancicourt (Carol Starks), is coming, as is Lady Kettlewell, at her daughter’s invitation.",
		"5" : "Pamela has a duel of wits with Hilda and understatedly tender moments with Chuffy and her mother; Gurney brawls with Staggles; a drunk and haplessly randy Staggles puts moves on both Hilda and the housemaid, Alice (Annie Jackson), who are mortified. The butler, Parsons (Derek Hutchinson), a Democratic Socialist, appears to have won a lottery. But even his fortune, like those of his economic “betters,” is in doubt.",
		"6" : "Some period conventions creak. Pamela ultimately proves more manipulative than independent, engineering her parents’ reconciliation, though Ms. Laing’s performance has a beguiling mischievousness. Staggles is a cartoon of working-class coarseness. But the production is well served by its costume supervisor, Holly Henshaw, fluent in tiaras, tweeds, ascots and drapey dresses. The director, Hugh Ross, adds a soupçon of farce to the percolating proceedings, keeping his busy cast on point.",
		"7" : "Throughout, Priestley gently reminds us of the ephemerality of affluence in a teetering economy. His words, with their generous, sympathetic regard for human nature, cast a binding glow over the production."

		"1" : "Is $8 billion enough to get the House health bill passed? And is it enough to ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions will still be able to get insurance if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act?",
		"2" : "The answer to the first question is maybe. On the second, it’s very likely to be no.",
		"3" : "A recent amendment to the Republican bill would allow states to waive an Obamacare rule that forbids charging sick people higher insurance prices, as long as the states set up a special insurance pool for those customers. Some Republican lawmakers worried these high risk pools would be inadequate. To win over the holdouts, the Republican leadership added another amendment that would provide an extra $8 billion over five years to states that choose to set up the pools.",
		"4" : "Two of the holdouts, Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Billy Long of Missouri, now seem convinced. On Tuesday, both said they could not support the Republican bill because it would make people with pre-existing health conditions too vulnerable. Now, they say they will vote for the bill with the new amendment. The vote could take place on Thursday.",
		"5" : "The $8 billion is not the only money that the health bill would make available to states. The American Health Care Act would also provide $100 billion to states over a decade to stabilize their markets, though states would have to match some of the federal spending. Amendments to the bill will provide another $30 billion to states, with only a few strings attached. If states pieced together all of the money and used it all for high-risk pools, about $138 billion would be available for such programs.",
		"6" : "So the real question is: Is $138 billion enough to fund high-risk pools?",
		"7" : "Answering the question precisely is difficult because the bill doesn’t explain exactly how these high-risk pools would work. We also don’t know how many states would choose to waive the Obamacare insurance regulations and set up high-risk pools instead. But several researchers have compiled estimates on what a well-run high-risk pool would cost, and $138 billion probably wouldn’t be enough.",
		"8" : "High-risk pools have been tried before, so we have some sense of what they might cost.",
		"9" : "Before the Affordable Care Act, 35 states had their own such pools, which were set up to offer coverage to people who had been denied a policy because they had a pre-existing medical condition such as diabetes, cancer or addiction.",
		"10" : "The main complaint about these pools is that they were underfunded. They typically charged people much higher prices than the market rate for a policy, and many people could not afford the coverage. States also had waiting lists and imposed limits on how much they would pay per year or over a lifetime for care. California, for example, had an annual cap of $75,000 per person.",
		"11" : "As a result, these pools covered just a fraction of people who had pre-existing conditions, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The combined enrollment for the states at the end of 2011 was 230,000, and the states had net losses averaging $5,510 per enrollee, according to Kaiser.",
		"12" : "In the early years of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government set up its own high-risk-pool program, and funded it at $5 billion over just under four years. That turned out to be too little money.",
		"13" : "The program, which required applicants to be uninsured for at least six months before they could sign up, had to stop taking customers after three years because it was running out of money. The program was quite generous to its beneficiaries — it gave them comprehensive coverage and asked them to pay the same price as healthy customers in their area. But care for the high-risk population ended up costing about $32,000 per enrollee.",
		"14" : "In 2010, two conservative health economists estimated costs for a well-run, national high-risk pool. Based on the cost of health care at the time, James Capretta and Thomas Miller, now both at the American Enterprise Institute, estimated that such a program would cost $15 billion to $20 billion a year. The program would cover around four million Americans at about $4,300 each, their estimate of historical risk pool spending.",
		"15" : "Over a decade, the cost would be $150 billion to $200 billion. But that assumes a low price tag, with programs that included lifetime caps and waiting periods. More left-leaning researchers have arrived at far higher price tags, assuming that more Americans would be likely to qualify or that their health costs would be higher.",
		"16" : "Of course, the $8 billion offered in the new amendment would go only to states that decide to waive the Obamacare rules and set up high-risk pools. If only one state waived those rules, $8 billion might be a very generous funding stream. If 30 states take up waivers, the money will be spread much more thinly.",
		"17" : "But either way, the amendment is designed to offer the money for only five years. The rest of the state money is also scheduled to be discontinued at the end of a decade. What would happen to high-risk patients after that is unclear.",
		"18" : "The new waivers are not the only way that the Republican bill might make it harder for people with prior health problems to get coverage. The waivers would allow states to eliminate rules requiring a basic set of benefits, which might mean that drug addiction treatment or prescription drugs would not always be covered.",
		"19" : "There would be substantial cuts to the Medicaid program, which covers many frail patients. And financial assistance would be pulled back for many low-income people who need it to afford their policies. For some of them, even a well-funded high-risk pool may be out of their financial reach."

		"1" : "We don’t know how quickly machines will displace people’s jobs, or how many they’ll take, but we know it’s happening — not just to factory workers but also to money managers, dermatologists and retail workers.",
		"2" : "The logical response seems to be to educate people differently, so they’re prepared to work alongside the robots or do the jobs that machines can’t. But how to do that, and whether training can outpace automation, are open questions.",
		"3" : "Pew Research Center and Elon University surveyed 1,408 people who work in technology and education to find out if they think new schooling will emerge in the next decade to successfully train workers for the future. Two-thirds said yes; the rest said no. Following are questions about what’s next for workers, and answers based on the survey responses.",
		"4" : "How do we educate people for an automated world?",
		"5" : "People still need to learn skills, the respondents said, but they will do that continuously over their careers. In school, the most important thing they can learn is how to learn.",
		"6" : "At universities, “people learn how to approach new things, ask questions and find answers, deal with new situations,” wrote Uta Russmann, a professor of communications at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna. “All this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life. Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job.”",
		"7" : "Schools will also need to teach traits that machines can’t yet easily replicate, like creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, adaptability and collaboration. The problem, many respondents said, is that these are not necessarily easy to teach.",
		"8" : "“Many of the ‘skills’ that will be needed are more like personality characteristics, like curiosity, or social skills that require enculturation to take hold,” wrote Stowe Boyd, managing director of Another Voice, which provides research on the new economy.",
		"9" : "Can we change education fast enough to outpace the machines?",
		"10" : "About two-thirds of the respondents thought it could be done in the next decade; the rest thought that education reform takes too much time, money and political will, and that automation is moving too quickly.",
		"11" : "“I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps,” wrote Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and founder of Data and Society, a research institute. “I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socioeconomic factors that are underpinning skill training.”",
		"12" : "Andrew Walls, managing vice president at Gartner, wrote, “Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation, there will be no quantum leap in our ability to ‘up-skill’ people.”",
		"13" : "Will college degrees still be important?",
		"14" : "College is more valuable than ever, research shows. The jobs that are still relatively safe from automation require higher education, as well as interpersonal skills fostered by living with other students.",
		"15" : "“Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion, empathy, vulnerability and social-emotional intelligence,” said Frank Elavsky, data and policy analyst at Acumen, a policy research firm.",
		"16" : "But many survey respondents said a degree was not enough — or not always the best choice, especially given its price tag. Many of them expect more emphasis on certificates or badges, earned from online courses or workshops, even for college graduates.",
		"17" : "One potential future, said David Karger, a professor of computer science at M.I.T., would be for faculty at top universities to teach online and for mid-tier universities to “consist entirely of a cadre of teaching assistants who provide support for the students.”",
		"18" : "Employers will also place more value on on-the-job learning, many respondents said, such as apprenticeships or on-demand trainings at workplaces. Portfolios of work are becoming more important than résumés.",
		"19" : "“Résumés simply are too two-dimensional to properly communicate someone’s skill set,” wrote Meryl Krieger, a career specialist at Indiana University. “Three-dimensional materials — in essence, job reels that demonstrate expertise — will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker’s skills.”",
		"20" : "What can workers do now to prepare?",
		"21" : "Consider it part of your job description to keep learning, many respondents said — learn new skills on the job, take classes, teach yourself new things.",
		"22" : "Focus on learning how to do tasks that still need humans, said Judith Donath of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society: teaching and caregiving; building and repairing; and researching and evaluating.",
		"23" : "The problem is that not everyone is cut out for independent learning, which takes a lot of drive and discipline. People who are suited for it tend to come from privileged backgrounds, with a good education and supportive parents, said Beth Corzo-Duchardt, a media historian at Muhlenberg College. “The fact that a high degree of self-direction may be required in the new work force means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future,” she said.",
		"24" : "Even if we do all these things, will there be enough jobs?",
		"25" : "Jonathan Grudin, a principal researcher at Microsoft, said he was optimistic about the future of work as long as people learned technological skills: “People will create the jobs of the future, not simply train for them, and technology is already central.”",
		"26" : "But the third of respondents who were pessimistic about the future of education reform said it won’t matter if there are no jobs to train for.",
		"27" : "“The ‘jobs of the future’ are likely to be performed by robots,” said Nathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast, an email company. “The question isn’t how to train people for nonexistent jobs. It’s how to share the wealth in a world where we don’t need most people to work.”"

		"1" : "TIJUANA, Mexico — By the time Francisca, Armando and their two surviving children made it to the United States border in late February, they were hungry, exhausted and virtually penniless. But the couple, who said that a son had been killed by a gang back in El Salvador and that their daughter had nearly been raped, thought they had finally reached safety.",
		"2" : "Under United States and international law, all people who ask for asylum are supposed to be allowed into the country to plead their case. But instead, they said, a Customs and Border Protection agent shooed them away.",
		"3" : "“There is no asylum here,” Francisca, 32, recalled the agent telling them. “We are not granting asylum.”",
		"4" : "Customs agents have increasingly turned away asylum seekers without so much as an interview, according to migrants and their lawyers, in a trend first noted several months ago and that appeared to accelerate after President Trump’s inauguration. That has left an untold number of migrants trapped in Mexico, where they have sometimes fallen prey to kidnappers seeking ransom or been driven into the hands of drug cartels and smugglers. Some have tried to enter the United States illegally and dangerously, through the desert or across the Rio Grande, a risky journey.",
		"5" : "“By rejecting asylum seekers at its borders, the United States is turning them away to face danger, persecution, torture, kidnappings and potential trafficking in Mexico,” Human Rights First, an organization that has studied the problem, said in a report released on Wednesday.",
		"6" : "No hard data exists on how often customs agents prevented asylum seekers from entering the United States, but many do make it past the border gates. Human Rights First said it had documented 125 people or families from countries including Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Turkey who were turned away at entry points in Arizona, California and Texas from November to April. The organization said the actual number was likely to be far higher, since most of the migrants never make contact with a lawyer or an American advocate.",
		"7" : "In response to questions, Customs and Border Protection said that the United States adhered to international law and convention permitting people to seek asylum on the grounds that they were being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, political belief or other factors.",
		"8" : "“If an officer or agent encounters a U.S.-bound migrant without legal papers and the person expresses fear of being returned to his/her home country, our officers process them for an interview with an asylum officer,” the agency said in a statement.",
		"9" : "The Trump administration has not ordered customs agents to turn away asylum seekers. But the president has made it clear he believes the asylum system in its current form contributes to the problem of illegal immigration.",
		"10" : "By law, those who request protection at a United States entry point must first be referred for a screening, known as a credible-fear interview, with an asylum officer from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
		"11" : "If the asylum officer decides people have a significant chance of proving a fear of persecution in their home country, they are allowed to apply for asylum before a judge, and from October 2016 through March 2017, according to the immigration agency, more than 38,000 people passed that step.",
		"12" : "But in recent years, judges have approved less than half of asylum requests. For migrants from Mexico and Central American countries, those numbers are even lower: only 10 percent to 23 percent since 2011, according to data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Many asylum seekers from the region claim they have been targeted by gangs, which is harder to prove than political persecution, or base their claims on poverty, which is not a ground for asylum.",
		"13" : "If they are denied, asylum seekers can be deported. But since many are released while their case is pending, some never return to court and evade deportation. The Trump administration has said asylum seekers should be released less often, and some lawyers said more of their clients are now being detained.",
		"14" : "Border crossings have dropped drastically since Mr. Trump took office, a sign that his tough talk is discouraging people from even trying the journey. Advocates for migrants assert that Mr. Trump’s talk has also emboldened some customs officers to ignore the law and take it upon themselves to keep migrants from receiving an asylum interview.",
		"15" : "“The tenor of interactions with C.B.P. officers has veered toward the openly hostile following his election,” said Nicole Ramos, an American lawyer representing asylum seekers traveling through Tijuana.",
		"16" : "Francisca, who requested her last name be withheld because of concerns for her family’s safety, said she tried to show some documents to the border agent in Tijuana — the death certificate for their son who was killed and a police report documenting the attempted rape of their daughter, also by gang members. But the official threatened to have the family deported if they did not retreat into Mexico, she said.",
		"17" : "“They treated us like we were trespassing,” said Francisca, who returned to a shelter for women and children with her 14-year-old daughter. Her husband, Armando, is with their 18-year-old son at a men’s shelter down the street.",
		"18" : "The report by Human Rights First said that a Honduran family was kidnapped and forced to pay a ransom for their release after they were turned back to Mexico twice by agents in Texas. Shaw Drake, the lead researcher of the report, said the area surrounding the ports of entry in Texas had been nicknamed the “hunting ground,” where cartels see migrants as easy prey for exploitation.",
		"19" : "When he fled the Mexican state of Guerrero, Benito Jiménez Alarcón, 22, carried a plastic bag filled with photographs of injuries from the time he was kidnapped for three days by gang members. They show bruises spanning his back from side to side, where he said he was struck with clubs. His legs are covered in bright purple and blue knots from gun lashings.",
		"20" : "He thought he would receive an asylum hearing after American border agents rifled through his belongings, including the photographs. The agents also asked him to remove his pants so they could see his injuries, he said.",
		"21" : "But the agents, possibly acting beyond their purview, told him that he needed police reports. Mr. Jiménez, who was at a Tijuana shelter this week, said that it would be impossible to obtain such reports because the police and gangs in his village collaborate with each other.",
		"22" : "A border agent told him he could claim asylum only with the help of a lawyer or through Grupo Beta, a Mexican organization that organized a numbering system to regulate the flow of migrants so they did not all seek asylum at once. But that system was intended mainly for Haitians, and non-Haitians have said they have not been given numbers.",

		"1" : "CHICAGO — Barack Obama has seen presidential libraries. Sometimes they are a monument to the past, he said, standing on stage in an auditorium on Wednesday; a record of accomplishments. “And a little bit of an ego trip,” he added. “‘See what I did.’”",
		"2" : "Mr. Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, returned for a day to the city they call home to unveil renderings of the Obama Presidential Center, a modern, stone-and-glass complex on Lake Michigan that they said would be a different kind of presidential library. Speaking to several hundred people on the city’s South Side, Mr. Obama, who was tieless and in a jovial mood, said that the center could be “a transformational project for this community.”",
		"3" : "“The main thing that Michelle and I contributed was just saying, ‘What is it that we want to see 10 years from now?’” he said, recounting his conversations with the architects who designed the center. “And we don’t want to see some big building that’s dead, and kids are getting dragged to it for a field trip. What we wanted was something that was alive, and that was a hub for the community and for the city and for the country.”",
		"4" : "It was the second time in 10 days that Mr. Obama had come to Chicago, as he has begun to emerge in public after the end of his presidency. He spent the weeks after the January inauguration of President Trump vacationing in Palm Springs, the British Virgin Islands and French Polynesia; on Sunday, he is scheduled to appear in Boston to accept the Profile in Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.",
		"5" : "The Obama center could be one of the biggest projects ever developed on the South Side, at a cost of at least $500 million. Expected to be completed in 2021, it will be located in Jackson Park, a space designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The 500-acre, lakefront park already includes the Museum of Science and Industry, a beach, golf courses and athletic facilities.",

		"8" : "Because Mrs. Obama lamented that Jackson Park did not have hills when she was a child growing up in the nearby South Shore neighborhood, Mr. Obama said the presidential center would be outfitted with a sledding hill.",
		"9" : "Mr. Obama said he envisioned “a studio where I can invite Spike Lee and Steven Spielberg to do workshops on how to make films,” and “a recording studio where I could invite Chance or Bruce Springsteen, depending on your tastes, to talk about how you could record music that has social commentary and meaning.”",
		"10" : "“What we want this to be is the world’s premier institution for training young people in leadership to make a difference in their countries, in their communities and in the world,” he said.",
		"11" : "Mr. Obama was joined on stage by Dina Griffin, a Chicagoan and one of the architects of the center. Last year, he chose Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, a husband-and-wife architectural team based in New York, to design the library and to work with Ms. Griffin. Ms. Tsien’s and Mr. Williams’s work includes the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts at the University of Chicago and the Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia.",
		"12" : "The attendees on Wednesday were a who’s who of Chicago civic life, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff in the Obama White House; Valerie Jarrett, a close friend and presidential adviser; and Kim Foxx, the state’s attorney for Cook County. Mr. Obama made the announcement at the South Shore Cultural Center, a landmark building where he and Mrs. Obama held their wedding reception in 1992.",
		"13" : "Many of them said they were thrilled that the Obamas had chosen the South Side of Chicago for the presidential center. “I think we really need the Obamas right now,” said Delois Martin, 67. “This could give kids a place to go, and hopefully it’ll help with all the violence we have here.”",
		"14" : "But the project has also brought fears of crowds and traffic, and of rapid development in Woodlawn that could make the neighborhood unaffordable for some of the current residents.",
		"15" : "The Rev. Corey Brooks, the pastor of a church in Woodlawn, said he has already seen signs of development near the library site.",
		"16" : "“I think that it could possibly bring a lot of hope to the community,” he said. “I would also hope that the library would not gentrify the community.”"

Colonel Thorsness, who had been brutalized during his six years of captivity at the notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, where he was a cellmate of John McCain’s, was 85.",
		"2" : "His death was announced by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, which said he had been treated for cancer. Colonel Thorsness, who lived in St. Augustine, Fla., died at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, WHNT News 19 in Huntsville, Ala., reported. He had been living in Alabama before moving to Florida.",
		"3" : "The skies some 40 miles southwest of Hanoi were filled with North Vietnamese MIG fighters, surface to air missiles (known as SAMs) and antiaircraft fire on the afternoon of April 19, 1967, when Major Thorsness — he was promoted to colonel on his retirement — carried out his 88th mission for the Air Force piloting an F-105 Thunderchief.",
		"4" : "He and his weapons specialist, Captain Harold Johnson, shot down one MIG, damaged another and struck at least two SAM batteries as they accompanied fighter-bombers attacking a North Vietnamese Army barracks.",
		"5" : "Although running out of ammunition and low on fuel, Major Thorsness hovered in the area to ward off MIGs and shot one down as airmen sought to rescue his wingmen, two F-105 crewmen who had parachuted from their craft when it was struck by enemy fire. They were later captured.",
		"6" : "Major Thorsness passed up a chance for aerial refueling, instead directing a tanker plane to replenish another fighter whose pilot had become lost in the skies amid the chaos.",
		"7" : "He finally headed to the nearest airfield in Thailand, 70 miles to the south.",
		"8" : "“I pulled the power back to idle and we just glided in,” he told Air Force Magazine in 2005. “We were indicating ‘empty’ when the runway came up just in front of us and we landed a little long. As we climbed out of the cockpit, Harry said something quaint like ‘that’s a full day’s work.’”",
		"9" : "Eleven days later, on Major Thorsness’s 93rd mission, with only seven remaining to make him eligible to end his tour, a MIG hit his plane with an air-to-air missile. He bailed out with Captain Johnson, suffering severe knee injuries as he ejected, and both were captured.",
		"10" : "Major Thorsness and Captain Johnson were held captive at the same prison camp, sarcastically labeled the Hanoi Hilton by prisoners, where Mr. McCain, later a United States senator and presidential candidate, was held. Guards there routinely beat and tortured P.O.W.s.",

Word of it came from the officer who had written the recommendation; he had later been shot down and taken to the Hanoi Hilton as well.",

		"1" : "BATON ROUGE, La. — A day after the Justice Department extracted a guilty plea from a South Carolina police officer who fatally shot a black man in the back, a federal prosecutor here explained on Wednesday why the department had declined to bring charges against two officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black Louisiana man, Alton B. Sterling.",
		"2" : "The announcement brought an end to what federal officials called an exhaustive investigation into the death of Mr. Sterling, who was killed on July 5 in the parking lot of a Baton Rouge convenience store where he often peddled CDs.",
		"3" : "“It was the unanimous decision of all the prosecutors and agents in this case that we simply did not have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either officer violated the federal criminal civil rights laws,” Corey R. Amundson, the acting United States attorney here, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.",
		"4" : "A day earlier and some 700 miles away, Michael T. Slager, a former police officer in North Charleston, S.C., pleaded guilty to a charge of willfully using excessive force to deprive Walter L. Scott of his civil rights when he shot Mr. Scott as he fled on foot in April 2015.",
		"5" : "The two cases have been among the most explosive in the nation’s complex and emotional debate about race and policing, and the developments in each came at a time when the country waits to see how episodes of police violence, which have spurred both rioting and peaceful protests, will be addressed by a Justice Department now headed by Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama.",
		"6" : "Little can be gleaned from the Sterling and Scott cases, however, about Mr. Sessions’s leadership at the department so far: Both cases were holdovers from the era of Mr. Sessions’s predecessor as attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, and their outcomes were set in motion before Mr. Sessions was appointed by President Trump.",
		"7" : "Indeed, the same career federal prosecutors who approved the plea deal with Mr. Slager approved closing the investigation into Mr. Sterling’s death with no charges.",
		"8" : "Mr. Sessions has said that broad investigations into entire police departments begun in the Obama era have contributed to an air of hostility toward law enforcement. But he has also explicitly said that bad police officers should be prosecuted.",
		"9" : "The Obama administration made a priority of giving sensitive use-of-force cases close scrutiny. But it also prompted criticism, and sometimes outrage, when it closed inquiries without bringing charges in cities like Minneapolis and Memphis and smaller locales including Ferguson, Mo., and Smyrna, Ga.",
		"10" : "Mr. Sessions’s department will almost certainly be forced to make similarly tough calls in the coming months. Over the weekend, a 15-year-old African-American boy, Jordan Edwards, was fatally shot in the head by a police officer in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs, Tex., and police officials have given conflicting accounts of the encounter.",
		"11" : "The two different outcomes of the federal inquiries this week left two families in very different positions. In South Carolina on Tuesday, Mr. Scott’s survivors held onto their grief even as they acknowledged a new phase: His mother, Judy Scott, forgave Mr. Slager, though she was not forthcoming about whether she thought he should receive a sentence of life in prison — a possibility under his plea agreement.",
		"12" : "In Baton Rouge on Wednesday, Mr. Sterling’s survivors and their lawyers vented their frustration and disappointment at a news conference held under a freeway as rain poured overhead. They urged Louisiana’s attorney general, Jeff Landry, who is conducting a state investigation, to bring criminal charges against the two officers, Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake.",
		"13" : "L. Chris Stewart, one of the Sterling family’s lawyers, said that Justice Department officials had informed them that the actions of the officers “were outrageous, were inappropriate, were not following procedure,” even though those actions did not rise to the level of a federal crime.",
		"14" : "Lawyers also said that Mr. Sterling’s relatives were shown enhanced video and audio clips revealing that Officer Salamoni had said to Mr. Sterling, “I’ll kill you, bitch,” or something like it, as he put a gun to Mr. Sterling’s head.",
		"15" : "Sandra Sterling, Mr. Sterling’s aunt, said that throughout the investigation, “in my heart and my mind, I was thinking that they were going to prosecute,” but when she heard that they would not, “it tore me up, all night.”",
		"16" : "Despite some obvious similarities, the two cases were very different. Experts said that the South Carolina shooting was a rarity in officer use-of-force cases: one in which the well-documented facts pointed with little doubt to an egregious act by a uniformed officer. A widely disseminated cellphone video of the episode showed Mr. Scott, who was unarmed, running away from Mr. Slager when the officer fired.",
		"17" : "Mr. Sterling’s case was much murkier, experts said, in great part because Mr. Sterling was armed with a .38-caliber revolver, a fact that the two Baton Rouge officers had been apprised of before they confronted him and tussled with him.",
		"18" : "Both cases came down to the question of whether the officers acted “willfully” to deprive the suspects of their Fourth Amendment right not to be subject to unreasonable physical force by the police. Although Mr. Slager had argued that he feared for his life before he shot Mr. Scott, he abandoned that defense when he pleaded to the civil rights offense.",
		"19" : "Speaking of Mr. Sterling’s case, Mr. Amundson, the prosecutor, said that to prove a violation of a federal criminal civil rights statute, “we have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers acted unreasonably and willfully — that is, they acted with a specific intent to do something that the law forbid.",
		"20" : "“This is the highest standard in federal criminal law, willfulness,” he continued. “Being reckless, escalating a situation that may have been de-escalated — those things are not a basis, under the law, for a federal criminal civil rights prosecution.”",
		"21" : "The 10-month investigation into the Sterling shooting involved dozens of F.B.I. witness interviews, and it examined, among other things, videos of the encounter, crime lab evidence, the officers’ backgrounds and personnel files, and the autopsy report.",
		"22" : "A news release summarized key details of the episode, which began at 12:30 a.m. when someone called 911 to report that a man who met Mr. Sterling’s description had threatened him with a gun outside the Triple S Food Mart.",
		"23" : "The officers went to the store, found Mr. Sterling there and engaged in the fatal 90-second encounter, in which Mr. Sterling refused to comply with their demand to put his hands on the hood of a car. Officer Lake used a Taser on Mr. Sterling, and Officer Salamoni tackled him, with Mr. Lake joining them on the ground. Officer Salamoni yelled twice that Mr. Sterling was “going for” a gun in his pocket. Mr. Salamoni fired a total of six rounds into Mr. Sterling’s chest and back.",
		"24" : "Mr. Amundson said that the Justice Department had consulted with two independent experts on the use of force who he said criticized aspects of the officers’ “techniques and approach,” but, in the end, found that their actions were reasonable when confronted with someone they were told was armed.",
		"25" : "A lawyer for Mr. Salamoni, John S. McLindon, declined to comment Wednesday on specific allegations about Mr. Salamoni’s behavior during his encounter with Mr. Sterling, citing the pending state investigation and professional conduct rules.",
		"26" : "But Mr. McLindon said he welcomed the Justice Department’s announcement.",
		"27" : "“I wouldn’t use the word ‘victory,’” he said. “We acknowledge that a man died. Nobody’s happy about that. But we’re relieved that the federal government has decided there’s not enough evidence here to prosecute.”",
		"28" : "Mr. McLindon said he expected state officials to reach the same conclusion."

		"1" : "COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ben Carson does not like the creature comforts, at least not for low-income Americans reliant on the government for a helping hand.",
		"2" : "As he toured facilities for the poor in Ohio last week, Mr. Carson, the neurosurgeon-turned-housing secretary, joked that a relatively well-appointed apartment complex for veterans lacked “only pool tables.” He inquired at one stop whether animals were allowed. At yet another, he nodded, plainly happy, as officials explained how they had stacked dozens of bunk beds inside a homeless shelter and purposefully did not provide televisions.",
		"3" : "Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people “a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say: ‘I’ll just stay here. They will take care of me.’”",
		"4" : "When Mr. Carson assumed the helm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he had no government experience, no political experience beyond a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination and no burning desire to run a major federal bureaucracy. But his views on poverty alleviation were tough-minded and well-known, informed by his childhood in Detroit and his own bootstraps journey from Motor City urban grit to the operating theater of Johns Hopkins University.",
		"5" : "After two months as the Trump administration’s point man on alleviating poverty, those views have not changed. At each stop of a tour through the Columbus area, local officials grinned as they explained the importance of his agency and made their cases for their budgets, which are on the president’s chopping block. But the secretary was resolute in his belief that too much government assistance has led to too much dependence.",
		"6" : "“We have some people who are mentally ill. We have some elderly and disabled people. We can’t expect in many cases those people to do a great deal to take care of themselves,” he said. But, he added, “There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them.”",
		"7" : "Antoine Williams, 45, who lives in a supportive housing complex for the chronically homeless, shook his head after Mr. Carson finished greeting officials in the lobby of his building and headed out in a four-car motorcade.",
		"8" : "“If he got something to do with Trump, that means he’s not really for us,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s not surprising. That’s what the rich do, they make it hard for the poor.”",
		"9" : "To some, just making the trip here showed that Mr. Carson is studying housing deeply and relying on both experts and personal stories to do his job. Mr. Carson, who has also visited Detroit, Dallas and Miami on his listening tour, peppered officials at housing projects in Ohio about which agency or company was paying for the maintenance, what comforts they were providing and what kind of job training facilities each had.",
		"10" : "And in an interview, he indicated that some of President Trump’s tough-minded budget cuts might be more bluster than bottom lines. HUD programs targeted for elimination, including Community Development Block Grants, which help fund efforts like Meals on Wheels, may wind up with different names, but they will continue to function in some of the same ways, he said, addressing the president’s proposal to cut HUD’s budget by 13 percent.",
		"11" : "“I know they have been called out for elimination. My impression is that what he is really saying is that there are problems with those programs,” Mr. Carson said. “And I think it may have been someone on his staff who kind of said, ‘Well, maybe we just need to get rid of the whole program.’ No, we don’t need to get rid of the whole program because there are some extremely good things there.”",
		"12" : "Mr. Carson said he planned to focus much of his energy on persuading developers to hire local low-income residents for construction programs.",
		"13" : "But he also indicated that money would be tight and focused. At a supportive housing center for drug addicts in Lancaster, Ohio, Trisha Farmer, the chief executive of the Recovery Center, pleaded for more federal help to house recovering addicts.",
		"14" : "Mr. Carson interjected. “We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves,” he said, before again asking minutes later about how comfortable the facility was letting people get.",
		"15" : "To some residents who met with Mr. Carson, the tour was nothing more than a dog-and-pony show.",
		"16" : "On his second day in Columbus, Mr. Carson stopped by the apartment of Alzene Munnerlyn, an 87-year-old living in senior housing and using a voucher to pay part of her rent after she was priced out of her last apartment. For about 10 minutes, Mr. Carson and several local housing officials posed for pictures in Ms. Munnerlyn’s living room and chatted with her about her place.",
		"17" : "As Mr. Carson was leaving, Ms. Munnerlyn, a retired information officer for the Ohio Department of Education, said she felt a little used. She had wanted to tell Mr. Carson that President Trump’s plans to cut funding for housing vouchers might make it harder for other seniors to keep their homes.",
		"18" : "But, she said: “It was staged. It was so fast.”",
		"19" : "“There needs to be a forum where you can just sit and talk with him, and he could ask you how you feel and then you could express yourself,” she said, frowning.",
		"20" : "Hours later, Bela Koe-Krompecher, clinical director at the Y.M.C.A. of Central Ohio, expressed a similar sentiment after walking with the housing secretary through an apartment and medical clinic for the chronically homeless.",
		"21" : "“It’s so choreographed,” he said moments after Mr. Carson left Franklin Station, a supportive housing center for the homeless. “I was kind of told, ‘Be quiet, Bela.’ But I think people need to have that blunt conversation.”",
		"22" : "During the visit, Mr. Carson had asked whether people had to be sober and drug free to get housing. The question is at the heart of a philosophy change in housing made some decades ago, and it stuck with Mr. Koe-Krompecher as he explained his worries about the Trump administration’s policy direction.",
		"23" : "“The thinking was for years, you had to be clean and sober to get housing. And harm reduction philosophy says, ‘No, you don’t,’” Mr. Koe-Krompecher explained. “‘Housing first’ says, ‘We house them, we get them services.’ So when he asked if someone was clean to live here? The answer is, ‘No.’”",
		"24" : "Not everyone was so harsh. Bryanna Ramirez, 24, beamed as Mr. Carson visited her two-bedroom apartment in a housing facility set aside for low-income parents who are working. Ms. Ramirez, a single mother, is earning an associate degree in science at Columbus State Community College and had been a supporter of Mr. Carson’s presidential bid. As she and Mr. Carson chatted, he signed her copy of his biography, “Gifted Hands,” writing, “Keep up the good work.”",
		"25" : "“The best thing to do is to do what Ben Carson is doing and that’s walking through to see if programs are really benefiting people and if people are really serious,” said Ms. Ramirez, who uses a Section 8 voucher to pay for an apartment she shares with her 2-year-old and 6-year-old daughters. “I think you should be in school or working to try to be on your own because that’s what America is about.”"

		"2" : "The depth of Republican opposition to the measure — which passed by a vote of 309-118, with little more than a dozen “no” votes from Democrats — reflects the perception on Capitol Hill that the minority party fared strikingly well in negotiations. There are also many conservative lawmakers who tend to oppose spending bills generally.",
		"3" : "The agreement, which is expected to earn final passage with a Senate vote as soon as Thursday, includes increased funding for some of President Trump’s priorities, like military and border security spending. But Democrats have broadly cheered it as a rejection of Mr. Trump’s signature campaign pledges, most notably a border wall with Mexico, which was not included.",
		"4" : "The measure supplies tens of millions of dollars to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred protecting Mr. Trump and his family — a relief for New York City, which has worked to protect Trump Tower, where the president’s wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, live. And it increases funding by $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, rebuffing the Trump administration’s request that its budget be reduced.",

And so each side doesn’t get everything they want, but we’re able to come together and find a package that advances many of our important goals.”",

The president has clearly chafed at Democrats’ satisfaction with the deal, lashing out on Tuesday morning with a pair of Twitter messages.",

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders planned to hold a showdown vote Thursday on their bill to repeal and replace large portions of the Affordable Care Act after adding $8 billion to the measure to help cover insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions.",
		"2" : "“We have enough votes,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said Wednesday night. “It’ll pass.”",
		"3" : "A breakthrough came earlier Wednesday thanks to an amendment proposed by Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, with the support of Representative Billy Long of Missouri, to add the money to the bill. The two Republican lawmakers had come out against the health care legislation, warning that it did not do enough to protect the sick, but they threw their support behind it on Wednesday.",
		"4" : "President Trump blessed Mr. Upton’s proposal at a White House meeting with the two lawmakers as he pressed hard for a vote that could at least ensure House approval of the bill, which embodies one of his central campaign promises. The vote Thursday will carry enormous potential consequences — for millions of patients, for Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda and for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has failed twice in recent weeks to bring the bill to the House floor.",
		"5" : "The measure faces a wall of opposition from health care providers, patient advocates and retirees, and has been derided by many Senate Republicans, who are all but certain to reject vast portions of it should it clear the House. But clearing the House is a necessary step to keep alive the Republican promise — seven years in the making — to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.",
		"6" : "Mr. Upton predicted that the bill was “likely” to pass the House, a tremendous reversal of momentum for a measure that has twice been pulled back from a vote for lack of support.",

		"19" : "But the fight over pre-existing conditions overshadowed a major reason the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the original bill would leave 24 million more Americans without health insurance after a decade: a rollback of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion in states that adopted it. The House plans to vote for the latest version before the budget office can finish a fresh assessment of its cost and impact.",
		"20" : "Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, predicted his state “would lead the parade to opt out of all the federal mandates” in the Affordable Care Act.",
		"21" : "But Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, said: “I would highly doubt that any governor, especially the governor of a large state like Florida, would seek a waiver. I just don’t think that any state would want to carry the burden of managing health care more than they already do, through Medicaid.”",
		"22" : "Mr. Curbelo illustrated the fluid politics swirling around the repeal bill. In a Twitter post on Thursday morning, he said he had just told House Republican leaders that the bill “in its current form fails to sufficiently protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.” In a late afternoon interview, he said, “I do not yet have a position on the bill.” He wanted to hear more from Mr. Upton, a respected Republican voice on health care.",
		"23" : "The Affordable Care Act set up a special health insurance program for people with cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses, to provide coverage until 2014, when insurers were forbidden to discriminate against people based on their health status. Claims far exceeded Obama administration estimates, exhausting most of the $5 billion provided by Congress.",
		"24" : "The average cost per enrollee was more than $32,000 a year in 2012, according to a federal report on the program, and the cost varied widely among states, from a low of $4,300 to a high of $171,900 per enrollee.",
		"25" : "Mr. Upton and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said they believed that the money in the bill would be adequate. “It’s our understanding that the $8 billion over the five years will more than cover those that might be impacted and, as a consequence, keeps our pledge for those that, in fact, would be otherwise denied because of pre-existing illnesses,” Mr. Upton said at the White House.",
		"26" : "To qualify for assistance under the Upton proposal, a person would have to live in a state with an approved waiver, have a pre-existing condition and be uninsured because of a failure to maintain “continuous coverage.”",
		"27" : "The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the money was a pittance compared with the likely need. “It’s a joke,” she said. “It’s a very sad, deadly joke.”",
		"28" : "The latest amendments to the bill amount to “a hoax on pre-existing conditions,” Ms. Pelosi said. “If Republicans have their way, Americans with pre-existing conditions will be pushed off their insurance and segregated into high-risk pools where they face soaring cost, worse coverage and restricted care.”"

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — While House Republicans lined up votes Wednesday for a Thursday showdown over their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Vickie Glenn sat in her Murphysboro, Ill., office and prayed for it to fail.",
		"2" : "Ms. Glenn, a Medicaid coordinator for Tri-County Special Education, an Illinois cooperative that helps more than 20 school districts deliver special education services to students, was worried about an issue that few in Congress were discussing: how the new American Health Care Act, with its deep cuts to Medicaid, would affect her 2,500 students.",
		"3" : "With all the sweeping changes the Republican bill would impose, little attention has been paid to its potential impact on education. School districts rely on Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor, to provide costly services to millions of students with disabilities across the country. For nearly 30 years, Medicaid has helped school systems cover costs for special education services and equipment, from physical therapists to feeding tubes. The money is also used to provide preventive care, such as vision and hearing screenings, for other Medicaid-eligible children.",
		"4" : "“If I could have 10 minutes with President Trump, I could help him understand what we do, why it’s important,” Ms. Glenn said. “If he understood, he would protect it, because this isn’t Republicans and Democrats. It’s just kids.”",
		"5" : "The new law would cut Medicaid by $880 billion, or 25 percent, over 10 years and impose a “per-capita cap” on funding for certain groups of people, such as children and the elderly — a dramatic change that would convert Medicaid from an entitlement designed to cover any costs incurred to a more limited program.",
		"6" : "AASA, an advocacy association for school superintendents, estimates that school districts receive about $4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements annually. In a January survey of nearly 1,000 district officials in 42 states, nearly 70 percent of districts reported that they used the money to pay the salaries of health care professionals who serve special education students.",
		"7" : "Republicans say federal health programs must be restructured to curb their soaring costs — the biggest driver of projected budget deficits — and force a smarter allocation of limited resources.",
		"8" : "But in a letter sent to top lawmakers this week, a coalition of school educators and advocacy organizations said such efforts would force states to “ration health care for children.”",
		"9" : "The advocates argued that under the House bill, the federal government would transfer the burden of health care to states, which would result in higher taxes, eligibility cuts or curtailed services for children. And they said that schools would have to compete for funding with other entities, like hospitals and clinics, that serve Medicaid-eligible children.",
		"10" : "The ability of school systems to provide services mandated under the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act would be strained. The law is supposed to ensure that students with disabilities receive high-quality educational services, but it has historically been underfunded.",
		"11" : "Under a little-noticed provision of the health care bill, states would no longer have to consider schools eligible Medicaid providers, meaning they would not be entitled to reimbursements.",
		"12" : "“School-based Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to children who can’t access critical health care and health services outside of their school,” said the letter sent this week by the Save Medicaid in Schools Coalition, which consists of more than 50 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, and the School Superintendents Association.",
		"13" : "Ms. Glenn said she believed that Medicaid should be reined in. But, she said, schools are already reimbursed for only a fraction of the costs of services they provide.",
		"14" : "The National Alliance for Medicaid in Education estimates that 1 percent of all Medicaid reimbursement goes to local school districts. Even without the funding, school districts would be legally required to provide special education services.",
		"15" : "“I realize there have to be cuts, because Medicaid’s been out of control,” Ms. Glenn said. But, she added: “We have so many more demands. We’re not in it making money. We’re constantly in the hole.”",
		"16" : "John George, executive director of the Montgomery County Intermediate Unit in Pennsylvania, said Medicaid primarily paid for speech, physical and behavior therapists.",
		"17" : "Special education students make up roughly 16 percent of his student population, he said, and his most recent Medicaid reimbursement was about $5.4 million.",
		"18" : "“It’s devastating,” Mr. George said of the potential impact of losing Medicaid funding. “Our most vulnerable citizens are going to be suffering the most. If any legislator votes for this, it’s unconscionable.”"

		"1" : "WASHINGTON — In the debate over how the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act would affect those with pre-existing health conditions, opponents and supporters alike have offered misleading talking points.",
		"2" : "Faced with polling indicating public support for protections, and after an emotional appeal by the television host Jimmy Kimmel that has gone viral, Republicans are making a dubious case that their updated bill provides similar coverage for those who are less healthy, while Democrats are overstating claims about how many are affected.",
		"3" : "Here’s an assessment:",
		"4" : "This is misleading. The amendment offered by Representative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, prohibits denying coverage to people with a pre-existing condition, but, importantly, it does not shield against potentially higher costs.",
		"5" : "Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to charge the same price for coverage regardless of health status, a practice known as community rating. The amended Republican bill, Mr. Ryan said in a news release, allows states to waive this rule for those with lapses in coverage, though it mandates that they provide “risk-sharing or reinsurance mechanisms.”",
		"6" : "These include high-risk pools, subsidies and a program to reimburse insurers for sicker patients. Similar mechanisms that existed before the Affordable Care Act covered few people and were underfunded, The New York Times reported.",
		"7" : "Joseph Antos, a health economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Ryan’s claim is “technically correct, but it’s not the same thing as providing the same promise as the A.C.A. has made.”",
		"8" : "False. The bill’s provisions on pre-existing conditions are certainly more complicated, but the two ways Mr. Scalise listed — prohibiting discrimination for those with continuous coverage, and high-risk pools — are not more protective than the Affordable Care Act.",
		"9" : "Many people with pre-existing conditions experience lapses in coverage, such as when they change jobs, for example. Once they do and are priced out of the pool of healthier people, they “may find coverage unaffordable,” said Timothy Jost, an expert on health law at Washington and Lee University.",
		"10" : "The bill does say that states must provide alternatives in lieu of community rating, but experts have said high-risk pools and the other options outlined provide a lot of leeway for pricing and benefits, and do not necessarily mandate coverage for people who cannot afford it because of pre-existing conditions.",
		"11" : "A spokesman for Mr. Scalise said that, in addition to numerous funding mechanisms for pre-existing conditions (which experts have said are inadequate), the repeal bill is better because insurers are exiting the A.C.A. so “if there is no one to sell insurance, no one with or without pre-existing conditions can get it.”",
		"12" : "Over all, the bill is also worse for older and sicker people, and its “skimpier subsidies and Medicaid cuts” could actually push people toward gaps in coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University, adding that Mr. Scalise’s claim is “utter nonsense.”",
		"13" : "This is misleading. Ms. Pelosi’s office cited a 2011 Department of Health and Human Services report, but the 17 million figure is the upper limit of the department’s estimates. The report’s lower figure, four million, is a fraction of that, and most of those children already had coverage before the Affordable Care Act.",
		"14" : "It was less common for insurers to deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, such as Mr. Kimmel’s son, than to their adult peers, Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation said. “But it certainly did happen,” he said.",
		"15" : "This is misleading. The Committee on Energy and Commerce, on which Mr. Pallone is the ranking Democrat, also cited the health and human services report, and his figure highlights the most drastic findings.",
		"16" : "The low end of the estimate was 50 million, a little more than one-third of Mr. Pallone’s figure. Most people with pre-existing conditions also have insurance through their employers (as many as 82 million, according to the same health and human services report), and would not be directly affected by the bill’s changes to pre-existing conditions. Others were covered through public options such as Medicaid, so Mr. Pallone’s and Ms. Pelosi’s claims are “baffling,” Mr. Antos said.",
		"17" : "Even for those in the individual market, the scope of the bill’s impact is difficult to predict because it is impossible to determine how many people would experience gaps in coverage, and how many states would choose to waive community rating.",
		"18" : "In the worst-case scenario — extrapolating a Kaiser analysis that found 27 percent of Americans under 65 had conditions that left them uninsurable — about 4.7 million people with pre-existing conditions could be affected, Mr. Levitt said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, sharply defended his decision to notify Congress about new emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation just before Election Day, reopening on Wednesday the still-raw debate over whether he cost her the presidency.",
		"2" : "Mr. Comey’s remarks at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing were his first public explanation for his actions, which roiled the campaign in its final days and cast a harsh spotlight on him. He acknowledged that revealing the renewed inquiry and enduring the torrent of criticism that followed had taken a toll.",
		"3" : "“It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,” he told the senators. “But honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision.”",
		"4" : "Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation is likely to be as crucial to his legacy as his 2004 standoff at a hospital bedside over the Bush administration’s wiretapping. He was then the acting attorney general, and with his ailing boss, John Ashcroft, nearby, he refused the request of White House aides to reauthorize a program for eavesdropping without warrants.",
		"5" : "But while the hospital showdown earned him bipartisan praise, Mr. Comey has been widely criticized for his decisions in the final days of the 2016 campaign.",
		"6" : "He displayed unusual emotion Wednesday in explaining his motives. By turns animated and defensive, at one point throwing his arms up to punctuate a point, the typically unflappable Mr. Comey argued that he had been left with no choice when he sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28 disclosing that his agents had just uncovered emails that might have been relevant to the Clinton investigation.",
		"7" : "“Concealment, in my view, would have been catastrophic,” he said, adding later that he knew the decision would be “disastrous for me personally.”",
		"8" : "Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the panel, pounced on Mr. Comey, saying he had taken a huge gamble in sending the letter to Congress without knowing how the newly discovered emails might shape the investigation.",
		"9" : "“We need to hear how the F.B.I. will regain that faith and trust,” she said. “We need straightforward answers to our questions, and we want to hear how you’re going to lead the F.B.I. going forward. We never, ever want anything like this to happen again.”",
		"10" : "She demanded to know why his treatment of the Clinton investigation had been so “dramatically different” from his treatment of an investigation into Russian efforts to meddle in the election.",
		"11" : "Mr. Comey rejected her claim.",
		"12" : "He said that the F.B.I. had confirmed the existence of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails months after it began, and said nothing more until after it was closed. Similarly, Mr. Comey said, the F.B.I. revealed its Russia investigation months after it was opened in the summer, and only after it had been widely reported in the news media. And, as with the Clinton inquiry while it was still underway, the bureau has refused to talk about what it has found with regard to Russia.",
		"13" : "“We’re not going to say another peep about it until we’re done,” Mr. Comey said, acknowledging that the inquiry was continuing. “And I don’t know what will be said when we’re done, but that’s the way we handled the Clinton investigation, as well.”",
		"14" : "The tone of the opening statements from both Ms. Feinstein and the Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, made clear that they wanted answers from Mr. Comey on a number of issues: Mrs. Clinton’s emails, the Russia investigation, leaks to the news media and the use of wiretapping as an investigative tool.",
		"15" : "“We need the F.B.I. to be accountable because we need the F.B.I. to be effective,” Mr. Grassley said.",
		"16" : "Wednesday’s proceeding, unlike a hearing in March in which Mr. Comey took the rare step of confirming  the existence of an investigation into Russian election interference, was supposed to be routine congressional oversight. But little has been routine for the F.B.I. over the past 10 months, as the dramatic moment from Mr. Comey showed.",
		"17" : "Mr. Comey plunged himself into the campaign when he announced in July that the F.B.I. was closing the Clinton email investigation. Though he said he would not recommend charging Mrs. Clinton or her aides, he also criticized her for how she had handled government information. So when the new messages emerged in October, he felt he had to inform lawmakers.",
		"18" : "“Somehow, her emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information,” Mr. Comey said. Later, he added, “His then-spouse Huma Abedin appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him for him to print out for her so she could deliver them to the secretary of state.”",
		"19" : "But several current and former government officials familiar with the investigation said that while some emails had been forwarded, the vast majority had instead been backed up to Mr. Weiner’s computer.",
		"20" : "What Mr. Comey saw as concealing, Justice Department officials saw as following the rules. The F.B.I. does not normally confirm open investigations. Senior departmental officials urged him not to tell Congress.",
		"21" : "His decision continues to weigh on the nominees themselves, as they made apparent in comments less than a day before Mr. Comey’s testimony on Capitol Hill. Mrs. Clinton spoke of her efforts to grapple with her loss, heaping blame on the F.B.I. and Russian-backed hackers.",
		"22" : "“The reason why, I believe, we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days,” she said Tuesday at an event in New York.",

		"24" : "President Trump seemed keener to forget the decisions the F.B.I. director made during the election. Hours after Mrs. Clinton spoke, he said on Twitter that Mr. Comey was “the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!”",
		"25" : "Mr. Trump also played down the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian efforts to help his campaign.",
		"26" : "“The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election,” he wrote.",
		"27" : "In his daily briefing for reporters Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the president remained confident in Mr. Comey. Asked whether Mr. Comey had made the right decision in writing to lawmakers on Oct. 28, Mr. Spicer did not answer.",
		"28" : "He also dismissed Mrs. Clinton’s comments.",
		"29" : "“With all due respect to her, that’s not how it works,” he said. “You don’t get to pick the day the election’s on.”",
		"30" : "“It’s somewhat sad that we’re still debating why the president won in the fashion that he did,” he added, without addressing Mr. Trump’s messages on Twitter.",
		"31" : "Mr. Comey was also pressed Wednesday about leaks to journalists, and about whether F.B.I. agents in New York had revealed information during the election to former federal law enforcement and elected officials, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the onetime New York City mayor. Three days before Mr. Comey’s announcement in October, Mr. Giuliani, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said on Fox News that the campaign had “a couple of surprises” in store.",
		"32" : "After Mr. Comey sent his letter, putting Mr. Giuliani’s comments in a new light, a Trump campaign spokesman said the former mayor had simply been “having fun.” But Mr. Giuliani undermined that assertion, saying he had known in advance that the F.B.I. had found new Clinton-related emails.",
		"33" : "“If I find out that people were leaking information about our investigations, whether to reporters or private parties, there will be severe consequences,” Mr. Comey told the questioner, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.",
		"34" : "Mr. Comey did find some support on the committee. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, sympathized with his actions.",
		"35" : "“You were given an impossible choice to make, and you did the best you could in light of the situation that you were presented with,” Mr. Cornyn said. “It strikes me as somewhat sad for people here and elsewhere to condemn you for notifying Congress.”"

		"1" : "JOHNS CREEK, Ga. — At first blush, this bedroom city of 83,000 a half-hour north of Atlanta might be mistaken for the perfect example of a white-flight Sun Belt suburb.",
		"2" : "It sits squarely in the congressional district once represented by Newt Gingrich, with excellent public schools and master-planned communities so pristine they could have been built by a model train aficionado. In 2015, the all-white City Council rejected the idea of expanding public transit out from majority-black Atlanta on the grounds that it “would increase high-density housing.”",
		"3" : "But something has been happening in Johns Creek — and, indeed, across much of the vast archipelago of cul-de-sac communities north of Atlanta that served as the launchpad for Mr. Gingrich’s 1994 Republican revolution. The promise of a suburban idyll has been increasingly attracting all kinds of people — many of whom are not white, and not Republican.",
		"4" : "Today, 24 percent of people in Johns Creek are of Asian heritage. Indian-Americans shop for saris at the Medlock Crossing strip mall and flock to the latest Bollywood hits at the multiplex. Chinese-Americans and food lovers of all stripes head to the Sichuan House, near the Target and Home Depot stores, for sliced pork ears in chili sauce and “tearfully spicy” mung bean noodles.",
		"5" : "Indeed, the northern Atlanta suburbs, once considered bastions of Republicanism, are experiencing an identity crisis — one that became acute with the success of a Democrat, Jon Ossoff, in a special House of Representatives election in Georgia’s Sixth District, which last sent a Democrat to Congress in the Carter administration.",
		"6" : "Fueled by fierce anti-Trump sentiment, millions in outside donations and an untiring door-to-door campaign mounted by liberals including many newcomers to the district, Mr. Ossoff placed first in an 18-way race in April and will face Karen Handel, a fixture in Georgia Republican politics, in a June 20 runoff.",
		"7" : "Many Republicans remain confident that Ms. Handel will prevail in a 70 percent-white district where even liberals concede that conservative culture dominates. Big churches and golf courses still do much to set the social tone, and homegrown conservative talk-radio personalities like Herman Cain and Erick Erickson help commuters assuage the increasingly painful slog through traffic.",
		"8" : "November was a watershed, however. Though she did not carry Georgia, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald J. Trump in both suburban Cobb County, part of which is in the Sixth District, and nearby Gwinnett County. Both were once considered classic white-flight suburbs; today Gwinnett is majority-minority, and Cobb is fast heading that way.",
		"9" : "At the same time, Republicans here reject the idea that demography is political destiny. Instead, they envision a future in which the charms of suburban life, and the conservative politics that made it possible, will rub off on everyone. Instead of the newcomers changing the suburbs, they say, the suburbs will change the newcomers.",
		"10" : "“You move to Cobb, you’ve got a good job and cheaper property taxes, and you say, ‘Hey, maybe this is a better way,’ ” said Michael Altman, 58, a former vice chairman of the Cobb County Republican Party.",
		"11" : "It is the kind of political reckoning that many American suburbs may soon confront, if they haven’t already. A report last year by the Urban Land Institute noted that the percentage of foreign-born Americans was at its highest in 90 years, and that millennials were now starting families and looking for good public schools. It estimated that 79 percent of the nation’s household growth would occur in the suburbs in the next decade, much of it in “affordable sunshine states” where the weather is warm, taxes are low and homes are relatively cheap.",
		"12" : "Low taxes, cheap homes and sunshine indeed helped fuel the rise of Atlanta’s northern suburbs beginning in the 1950s — along with a heavy dollop of racism.",
		"13" : "During integration the Klan presence was strong in Cobb County, and in later years, it was home to the former segregationist governor Lester Maddox and the white supremacist and convicted church bomber J. B. Stoner. But Cobb also became home to a large group of transplants decoupled from local history, many of them professionals transferred to metro Atlanta from elsewhere who were looking for good public schools.",
		"14" : "Mr. Gingrich, who served as House speaker from 1995 to 1999, used language in his heyday that liberals saw as racially coded, railing against the “welfare state” of Atlanta. But for the most part he appealed to newcomers and old-timers alike, extolling free markets, technology and traditional values as a means of answering “the cries of the baby boom generation for a new politics responsive to the future’s needs.”",
		"15" : "Maddox and Stoner are long dead, but the high-performing schools in places like unincorporated East Cobb County still serve as a magnet. Eight years ago, they attracted Jen Cox, a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat who had been living in Denver.",
		"16" : "On a recent afternoon, Ms. Cox, a 47-year-old mother and real estate agent, backed her Toyota Highlander out of the garage of her handsome five-bedroom home in a neighborhood called Kings Cove. She drove past subdivisions of simple 1970s-vintage homes and newer, busier McMansions. Some of the neighborhood names, like Plantation North, hinted at the tumult of Southern history, though most — Edgewater, Carriage Park — strove for a more ahistoric blandness.",
		"17" : "Ms. Cox is a co-founder of PaveItBlue, one of the many new grass-roots liberal groups that have sprung up or vastly expanded to help a Democrat win the Sixth District contest. As she passed numerous yard signs for Mr. Ossoff, she noted that such a display of support for a liberal would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.",
		"18" : "Ms. Cox described the social pressure to conform here that pervaded dinner parties and play dates, influencing the politics of even newcomers. “It’s something really palpable here, like, ‘You’re in the Deep South. This is the way it is, and if you don’t like it, we don’t want to hear from you,’ ” she said.",
		"19" : "But now, with the volunteers pushing Mr. Ossoff into the runoff, she said: “I don’t think there’s a clear explanation to what’s going on out here. I think everyone’s trying to figure it out.”",
		"20" : "Some feel threatened by the new liberal activism. On Election Day in East Cobb, a man pulling out of a polling place parking lot in a Jeep asked Ed Neubaum, a man with an Ossoff sign, whether he was a fan of Nancy Pelosi.",
		"21" : "Certainly, replied Mr. Neubaum, a 57-year-old real estate agent. The other man replied with a vulgarity, called Mr. Neubaum a socialist and said he was responsible for “the burning of America.”",
		"22" : "“The burning of America, my God!”",
		"23" : "“Yeah, the violence that you propagate …”",
		"24" : "“How can I propagate violence? Wow.”",
		"25" : "The man found an opening in the afternoon traffic. The Jeep roared off.",
		"26" : "Mr. Ossoff’s supporters mention a number of incidents like these: hostile, but not violent. And in recent years, the suburbs’ changing racial realities have created their own tensions. In 2015, a Cobb County councilwoman who is black accused a county police officer of harassment and intimidation when the officer followed her home, aggressively she said, in an unmarked car. In January, a Gwinnett County commissioner, a white Republican, referred to Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon, as a “racist pig” in a Facebook post, infuriating many Democrats and African-Americans, who called for the commissioner’s resignation.",
		"27" : "Others note the small daily acts of interracial harmony on the neighbor-to neighbor-level that do not make headlines.",
		"28" : "At the same time, at the level of regional planning, the Cobb and Gwinnett county governments have remained staunchly opposed to expanding Atlanta’s bus and rail passenger system, Marta, even as the road system has failed to keep up with the influx of drivers. The rejection of public transit has long been caught up with fears of minority incursions and crime and a philosophical disinclination to fund big government. But some here say that this, too, could be changing.",
		"29" : "“We’re not talking about whether Marta should, or mass transit should, come to Cobb County as much as we’re talking about it being done smartly,” said Jason Shepherd, chairman of the Cobb County Republican Party.",
		"30" : "In Johns Creek, the Asian-American residents came not for rail lines but for the schools, just as whites had before them, said Anjali Enjeti, who moved to the city 10 years ago from Pennsylvania. Many also work in the numerous tech companies stuffed in the surrounding office parks.",
		"31" : "As the number of Asian-Americans has grown, Ms. Enjeti, a freelance writer, has noticed a different kind of white flight, in which people are leaving for neighboring Forsyth County not because minorities are lowering the standards in public schools — but because they are perceived to be raising them.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump may have lost the spending fight, but he can celebrate at least one significant congressional accomplishment this week: He single-handedly saved the Senate filibuster.",
		"2" : "By demanding in two Twitter posts on Tuesday morning that the Senate change one of its signature legislative rules, Mr. Trump created an uncharacteristic cause for bipartisan unity. Senators in both parties rushed on Tuesday to categorically embrace the filibuster and profess that it would remain untouched.",
		"3" : "“There is an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis not interested in changing the way the Senate operates on the legislative calendar,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, declared, sounding like he meant it. “And that will not happen.”",
		"4" : "Mr. McConnell and his colleagues say that eliminating the supermajority threshold on legislation would change the very nature of the chamber, diminish American democracy and make the dignified Senate too much like the unruly House.",
		"5" : "All that might be true. But there are other, less obvious reasons for Republicans to want to hold fast to the filibuster given the current state of play in Washington. As the bipartisan budget agreement on Sunday showed, the filibuster also provides a check on Mr. Trump by giving Democrats a voice in legislation.",
		"6" : "Majority Republicans then have a ready excuse for not taking actions pushed by the White House that senators of both parties might deem unwise: The Democrats will not allow it. The result in the case of the spending bill was a compromise that denied the White House money for a border wall while satisfying imperatives of both parties in Congress.",
		"7" : "At the same time, Republicans privately acknowledge that eliminating the 60-vote requirement would subject them to extreme pressure from the right to unilaterally pursue an array of conservative initiatives that could ultimately cause a voter revolt. The filibuster is their political safety valve.",
		"8" : "More important, Republicans say the filibuster has been more helpful to them in preventing Democratic legislation over the years than it has been to Democrats in thwarting Republicans. They fear that eliminating the filibuster would be catastrophic for Republicans if Democrats regain power.",
		"9" : "“If you believe in limited government, the filibuster has been your friend far more than your foe,” said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who, like many other senators, was adamant that he would not support a weakening of the tactic.",
		"10" : "Until Mr. Trump’s latest outburst, the fate of the legislative filibuster was far from assured.",
		"11" : "Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the former majority leader, predicted last year that Democrats would try to jettison the filibuster if Hillary Clinton won the presidency and Democrats won the Senate, only to see Republicans continue the stalling tactics they employed so successfully against President Barack Obama. And Democrats had already shown a willingness to make changes with their 2013 maneuver to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most judicial and executive branch nominees.",
		"12" : "Then Mr. Trump’s victory completely turned the tables, with the Republicans who now controlled Congress and the White House ruminating about gutting the filibuster if Democrats stood in the way of the Trump agenda. Republicans in the House and conservative groups cheered on the idea, saying it could finally break a logjam in conservative legislation.",
		"13" : "Early in Mr. Trump’s tenure, some Senate Republicans said a change in the filibuster rules on legislation remained a possibility if Democrats refused to give any ground to the unified Republican government. But the shaky start of the Trump administration and the ensuing chaos seem to have left Republicans on Capitol Hill less inclined to take big political risks for the president.",
		"14" : "The certainty of the sentiment against a change was striking.",
		"15" : "“He can say what he wants,” Mr. Flake said of Mr. Trump. “This is separation of powers. We appropriate.”",
		"16" : "Mr. McConnell, who considers himself an ardent Senate institutionalist, was always reluctant to endorse such a radical departure from Senate tradition, and he said so repeatedly. He did, however, engineer a change that allowed Republicans to break a filibuster against Neil M. Gorsuch with a simple majority vote and put him on the Supreme Court last month.",
		"17" : "But that outcome seemed less an affront to the Senate culture than payback for, and a natural progression from, the Democrats’ 2013 decision on nominations. It settled that score and made senators less interested in going further, drawing them back from the brink of more changes.",
		"18" : "Sixty-one senators signed a letter circulated by Senators Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, backing the 60-vote threshold on legislation. The negative response to Mr. Trump’s morning Twitter posts — “Either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” he wrote, saying the budget compromise was only necessary because of the filibuster — appeared to seal the deal.",
		"19" : "“This isn’t a partisan issue,” Mr. Coons said Tuesday. “Republicans and Democrats both recognize that control of the Senate will inevitably change every few years, and members of both parties value the minority party’s right to have a say in legislation.”",
		"20" : "And, of course, it is the clout of the minority and the mere possibility of the filibuster that empowers each individual senator far beyond an individual lawmaker in the House.",
		"21" : "The simple threat of objecting to legislation can bring them attention from their leaders, as well as the news media, and make them players in the Washington drama. To senators, that might be the best reason of all for defying Mr. Trump and holding on to their precious filibuster."

		"4" : "The funding bill does add nearly $1.5 billion for border and aviation security. But while most attention has been paid to Congress’ decision not to include money for Mr. Trump’s border wall, an examination of the 1,665 pages of the budget and accompanying documents shows a rejection of much of the president’s approach to border security in favor of a more conventional approach by lawmakers.",
		"5" : "The funding includes money for new surveillance systems, replacing existing border fencing, and adding more unmanned aerial vehicles and other border surveillance technologies for Border Patrol agents. It also adds some money to hire Border Patrol agents, in an effort to increase the number of agents up to the level mandated by Congress.",

		"7" : "Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for deportations, will receive $6.4 billion, including $617 million for additional detention beds and to pay for the transportation and removal of detained undocumented immigrants.",

		"9" : "Lawmakers also declined to provide money in the proposed budget to hire 10,000 ICE agents, as requested by Mr. Trump.",
		"10" : "The bill also does not cut money for so-called sanctuary cities, localities that limit how much they cooperate with federal immigration authorities.",
		"11" : "During his campaign and since taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked sanctuary cities, saying they harbor undocumented immigrants who are dangerous criminals.",
		"12" : "He signed an executive order in January directing agencies to find ways to cut funding to localities that did not cooperate with federal immigration officials. In March, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said state and local governments seeking Justice Department grants must certify they are not sanctuary cities in order to receive federal money.",
		"13" : "A federal judge in San Francisco last month temporarily blocked Mr. Trump’s January executive order on immigration, which tried to tie federal funding for cities to their efforts in helping ICE in immigration enforcement, saying that only Congress had that authority.",
		"14" : "Lawmakers also asked the Department of Homeland Security not to abandon Priority Enforcement, a program set up under the Obama administration that they said had gotten better results in spurring local law enforcement authorities to cooperate with immigration officials.",
		"15" : "Mr. Trump wants to re-establish Secure Communities, a program set up during the George W. Bush administration that identified potentially deportable immigrants who had committed crimes. Under the program, immigration agents were provided with fingerprint records collected at local jails, regardless of the severity of the crime or if the person had been convicted. President Obama ended the program in 2014, saying he wanted ICE to focus on “felons not families.”",
		"16" : "“ICE should ensure that the reinstatement of the Secure Communities program does not undermine the progress it made through PEP in 2015 and 2016,” lawmakers wrote.",

Speaking to reporters during a White House briefing, Mick Mulvaney, the budget director, said the administration had outfoxed Democrats in the budget showdown.

		"3" : "As Japan faces continuing security threats from North Korea, Mr. Abe said that there should be no room for arguing that the military, with just over 227,000 active-duty troops, “may be unconstitutional.”",
		"4" : "Japan has stepped up its show of military force amid concerns about North Korea’s provocative behavior, sending two naval destroyers to join the American aircraft carrier Carl Vinson in exercises off the Korean Peninsula. And on Monday, a Japanese warship accompanied a United States Navy supply ship headed to join the Carl Vinson and three other warships in a strike group.",
		"5" : "Pacifism is enshrined in the Constitution, with a clause known as Article 9 calling for the complete renunciation of war. That clause represents a cherished part of the country’s postwar identity, and Mr. Abe has long made clear his desire to amend it. Previous calls to revise it have been met with skepticism in Japan and in countries including China and South Korea that object to any signs of Japan’s remilitarization.",
		"6" : "Successive Japanese governments, as well as scholars, have argued that the military is constitutional because the charter allows the country to defend itself.",
		"7" : "But Mr. Abe has pushed for a much broader interpretation, and two years ago he helped secure passage of security legislation that authorized overseas combat missions by the military in the name of “collective self-defense” and alongside allied troops. The passage of the laws came after a grinding political battle and days of public demonstrations.",
		"8" : "Acknowledging the politically delicate nature of the latest proposal to revise the Constitution, Mr. Abe said on Wednesday that the country “must hold fast to the idea of pacifism.”",

Mr. Abe and his cabinet “are aware that Article 9 is very popular, and revising Article 9 is going to be alarming to many countries around them,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. Just last week, a survey by the public broadcaster NHK found that 82 percent of respondents were “proud of the current Constitution that advocates pacifism.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Nakano said that Mr. Abe’s proposal “could be a convincing idea, but it could also bring forth inevitable criticism that you’ve broken the Constitution first, and you are ex post facto trying to make it O.K.”",
		"11" : "About 55,000 people attended a meeting in Tokyo opposing the amendment, and opposition was strong on social media.",
		"12" : "“Is there an earnest desire among people to change the current Constitution at all costs? I’ve never heard that there are many such voices,” wrote Tomo Kimura on Twitter.",
		"13" : "But others suggested that Mr. Abe was merely trying to align the Constitution with current practice. “I think the Constitution should be amended corresponding to the reality in which Japan’s security environment has dramatically changed,” someone wrote on Twitter under the handle @_500 yen.",

		"16" : "Jun Okumura, a former government official and now a visiting researcher at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs, said he thought Mr. Abe would be able to pass the amendment. In a July election, the governing coalition and its allies captured two-thirds of the seats in the upper house of Parliament, the amount required to proceed with a constitutional revision.",
		"17" : "Any revision would also be subject to approval in a referendum. A poll published this week by Kyodo News showed that respondents were nearly equally split on the question of whether the pacifist clause should be revised."

He has supported the deployment of the antimissile system, which has angered China, but he has also said South Korea should pay for it. He has said American warships were steaming toward the region, only for it to emerge that they were not.

The policy, championed by Mr. Roh and his predecessor, heralded a period of détente, but conservatives argue that it helped finance the North’s nuclear weapons program. They also view Mr. Moon as a replica of Mr. Roh, a liberal who once said he would never “kowtow to the Americans.”",

		"13" : "Mr. Ahn initially opposed the Thaad deployment, but he has since reversed that position and said it would be “irresponsible” to alter an agreement with an ally. That has been viewed as an attempt to woo conservative voters, who support the deployment.",

		"15" : "It remains to be seen how successful Mr. Ahn’s play for the conservative vote will be. The latest surveys have shown his surge in popularity fading, as Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate of Ms. Park’s conservative Liberty Korea Party, has narrowed the gap with him. That is the last snapshot of the public mood until the election; under election law, no polls conducted after Tuesday can be published.",
		"16" : "A former physician who became a software mogul before entering politics, Mr. Ahn, like Mr. Trump, is from a wealthy, well-connected family and is often characterized as a populist. The men have something else in common: an alma mater.",
		"17" : "Both Mr. Ahn and Mr. Trump attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. During a debate in April, Mr. Ahn said he would use his school connections and business background to build a rapport with the American president.",
		"18" : "Mr. Hong, 62, bills himself as the true representative of conservatives, who suffered a political body blow with Ms. Park’s impeachment and have been looking for a new standard-bearer.",
		"19" : "A cantankerous ex-governor and former prosecutor, Mr. Hong has employed rhetoric that has been compared to Mr. Trump’s. He has said he would order the first executions in the country in two decades and crack down on “aristocratic unionists” whom he accuses of slowing the economy.",
		"20" : "“If I am elected, the first thing I will do is to propose a summit meeting with President Trump on board the Carl Vinson,” Mr. Hong said this week, referring to the American aircraft carrier sent to the region in a show of force against North Korea.",
		"21" : "Mr. Hong has angered many people with his views on social issues — promising, for instance, to “crack down” on homosexuality, on the grounds that it spreads AIDS. (Homosexuality is a sensitive issue in South Korean politics, largely because many churchgoing voters oppose it, and Mr. Moon has said that he does not approve of it.)",
		"22" : "Mr. Hong also recently said that “washing dishes is women’s work.” And in a passage from his 2005 memoir that recently came to light, he describes participating in what appears to be an attempted date rape while in college.",
		"23" : "In the book, Mr. Hong writes that a roommate asked him and other friends to obtain a supposed aphrodisiac, which the roommate mixed into a beer that he gave to a girl. “He said the drug did not work,” Mr. Hong wrote. “She woke up and put up strong resistance, biting and scratching him in the face.”",
		"24" : "After a furor erupted over the story, with rival candidates demanding that Mr. Hong quit the race, Mr. Hong said he had merely relayed an anecdote that he had “overheard.”"

		"1" : "HONG KONG — China has invested more than $100 billion over the last decade alone in a nationwide campaign to plant new forests, and its top leaders speak of the effort with pride.",
		"2" : "“Planting trees now will benefit our future generations, and we should roll up our sleeves to plant more trees year after year, generation after generation,” President Xi Jinping said in March at a tree-planting ceremony in Beijing.",
		"3" : "But a study published on Wednesday suggests that some official estimates of China’s greening campaign overstated its successes, and mistook shrubs for forests.",
		"4" : "United Nations data, which are based on national statistics, show that between 2000 and 2010 China gained 167,568 square miles of forest, an area slightly larger than California. China’s own estimates were not far behind.",
		"5" : "But the newly released study, based partly on an analysis of high-resolution photographs, found that China had gained only about 12,741 square miles of forest over the same period, an area roughly the size of Maryland. And it found that much of the government’s reported new forests were actually just collections of shrubs.",
		"6" : "“China’s forests are not as green as we think,” Xu Jianchu, a co-author of the study and a professor of ethnoecology at the Kunming Institute of Botany in southwest China, said in a telephone interview.",
		"7" : "Lu Zhi, a conservation biologist at Peking University in Beijing, who was not involved in the study, said its findings were consistent with recent research suggesting that China’s forest resources have not significantly increased despite the government’s extensive tree-planting campaign or its efforts to halt commercial logging in forests.",
		"8" : "The authors of the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, wrote that their results highlighted a need for more refined forest monitoring and a better way of measuring performance of Chinese forests based on “climatic suitability.”",
		"9" : "“These findings indeed point to major gaps between the way the concept of forest is defined in the various international conventions, versus how the general public understands it,” said Meine van Noordwijk, a professor of agroforestry at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and the chief science adviser for the World Agroforestry Center. He was not involved in the study.",
		"10" : "The study’s authors wrote that the United Nations forestry data was far higher than their own estimates in part because it counted young plantations and bare land that is earmarked for planting new forests. Places where modest forestry gains were detected in China were often not targeted for afforestation, they wrote, because the land was in demand for agriculture or urbanization.",
		"11" : "Pinpointing tree-cover change in China is globally important, the authors wrote, in part because China is the world’s leading timber importer and has invested more money than all other countries combined in tree-planting.",
		"12" : "The major reason for ambiguity in forest estimates worldwide is that there are over 800 official definitions for the term “forest,” with criteria ranging from over 10 percent to over 30 percent tree cover, the journal Nature Climate Change reported in 2015.",
		"13" : "Mr. Xu said the newly released study underscored that the Chinese government should pay closer attention to the areas it targets for new forests, and avoid its practice of planting trees in semi-arid regions and deserts. “It’s time to look at both the economic efficiency and the ecological returns,” he said.",
		"14" : "Mr. van Noordwijk said that to avoid such discrepancies in measuring forests, researchers could either clearly differentiate subcategories under the “umbrella” term of forest, or else avoid the term entirely.",
		"15" : "“Once you are over the initial shock, the latter is actually feasible,” he said."

		"1" : "BEIJING — President Xi Jinping of China spoke by phone on Wednesday with the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, in what Chinese news media described as a friendly call that came just a few days after President Trump’s amicable conversation with the authoritarian Filipino leader.",
		"2" : "Mr. Xi’s outreach to Mr. Duterte appeared to be part of efforts by the Chinese to woo a longtime American ally and strengthen their sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.",
		"3" : "Chinese news media said North Korea and other issues were discussed in the phone call. On Saturday, Mr. Trump, surprising his own staff, telephoned Mr. Duterte and invited him to visit the White House.",
		"4" : "Mr. Trump’s gesture was widely condemned over concerns about human rights abuses in the Philippines carried out under Mr. Duterte’s auspices. In a sign of lingering tensions between the two countries, Mr. Duterte later said he might be too busy to make the trip.",
		"5" : "In Mr. Xi’s follow-up to Mr. Trump’s overture, he pledged to deepen ties with the Philippines and called the country a “friendly neighbor,” according to Chinese news media reports. Mr. Xi also said Manila would be an “important partner” in his plan to invest in infrastructure overseas.",
		"6" : "The remarks were in line with China’s recent attempts to capitalize on tensions between the United States and the Philippines and draw Mr. Duterte’s government closer with promises of economic aid. But they also appeared to be a way of thanking the Philippines for not provoking China over disputed South China Sea islands claimed by both countries.",
		"7" : "“There is a scramble to win over the heart and mind of President Duterte,” said Patrick M. Cronin, a senior adviser at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based policy research group.",
		"8" : "The two leaders also discussed tensions in North Korea, with Mr. Xi reiterating China’s call for restraint and dialogue. Mr. Trump and Mr. Duterte also spoke about North Korea in their call on Saturday, White House officials said.",
		"9" : "The phone call between Mr. Xi and Mr. Duterte came against the backdrop of warming ties between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump, who is increasingly reliant on China to help contain the crisis over North Korea. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has threatened the United States and its Asian allies with nuclear war and repeatedly tested missiles in defiance of international sanctions.",
		"10" : "The North Korea crisis has minimized or at least obscured trade disputes and other problems between the United States and China, including China’s territorial claims over most of the South China Sea.",
		"11" : "In what appears to be a remarkable deference to China by the Trump administration, no American Navy ship has gone within 12 miles of any disputed island in the South China Sea claimed by China since Mr. Trump took office, Defense Department officials say.",
		"12" : "That is a major turnabout by Mr. Trump and his aides, who once vowed to challenge China’s control of disputed reefs that it has turned into artificial islands, replete with military equipment and runways. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had said during his confirmation hearings that China should be denied access to the islands.",
		"13" : "Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has upset the balance of power in Asia by vowing to cut some military and economic ties with the United States. At the same time, he has embraced China as an economic and security ally and acquiesced to Chinese demands to resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea through direct talks rather than international arbitration.",
		"14" : "This week, Mr. Duterte welcomed Chinese Navy ships to Davao City, where he had served as mayor for many years. It was the first visit by the Chinese Navy in several years.",
		"15" : "In the phone call, Mr. Duterte thanked Mr. Xi for allowing him to tour a Chinese missile destroyer during the visit, according to a statement on Wednesday from the presidential palace in Manila.",
		"16" : "Relations between China and the Philippines were once seriously frayed over disputed territory in the South China Sea, a major waterway for international shipping. But under Mr. Duterte, the tensions have eased.",
		"17" : "In a possible sign of Mr. Duterte’s efforts to appease Beijing, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Mr. Duterte presided over this year, did not criticize China’s actions in the South China Sea in an official statement following a meeting in Manila last week.",
		"18" : "Asked by reporters covering that meeting whether China should be pressured over its territorial claims, Mr. Duterte was dismissive. “Who will dare pressure?” he asked. “Who can pressure China? Us?”",

		"20" : "Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Mr. Xi might have been showing approval for Mr. Duterte’s position by agreeing to speak with him.",

	"content" : {
		"1" : "BEIJING — President Xi Jinping of China and President Trump, despite vastly different personal styles, have several things in common.",
		"2" : "They were both born to privilege. They both possess boundless self-confidence. Each seeks advice from a select inner circle, ignoring the big bureaucracies of his government.",
		"3" : "Mr. Trump, not known for his effusive praise of world leaders, has talked up their relationship, saying in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” last weekend that his relationship with China was “already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we’ve ever had.” He called Mr. Xi “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect.”",
		"4" : "But beneath the bonhomie, Chinese analysts say, fundamental differences of strategic interest are likely to undermine any personal ties Mr. Trump says he has forged with the Chinese leader. The romance, they say, may be more a short marriage of convenience.",
		"5" : "Mr. Trump’s public effusiveness is barely reciprocated in China. The state-run media accords Mr. Trump polite coverage, much more so than it did President Barack Obama — a signal that the government, for the time being, would like the Chinese people to view the American president in a positive light.",
		"6" : "Among foreign policy experts, however, there is skepticism that Mr. Trump’s flattery of Mr. Xi, and his reliance on the Chinese leader to bear down on North Korea over its nuclear program, will bring the results he wants.",
		"7" : "Mr. Trump has said he would give Mr. Xi more on a trade deal if China — North Korea’s main trading partner and sole major ally — cracked down on its recalcitrant neighbor. “I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade,” Mr. Trump said last weekend.",
		"8" : "In essence, the Trump administration is asking China to apply maximum economic pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, so that he will relinquish his nuclear arsenal, or at least agree to negotiate on Washington’s terms.",
		"9" : "Analysts say Mr. Xi is likely to take steps to curb the activities of some Chinese companies that help North Korea with the foreign exchange it badly needs, but not all of them. They say he may even, at some point, shut down the oil supply from China that keeps the economy afloat — but if so, only for a short period.",
		"10" : "On Wednesday, a commentary in North Korea’s state-run news agency warned that the country would continue its nuclear weapons development program even if it risked losing a friendly relationship with China.",
		"11" : "North Korea “will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is,” a writer named Kim Chol wrote in the commentary, which was carried by the North’s Korean Central News Agency",
		"12" : "Some analysts said Mr. Trump’s own predictability should not be taken for granted.",
		"13" : "“He needs China to help implement what he wants on North Korea,” said Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute for International Relations at Tsinghua University. “It won’t work. Trump will change his attitude to China very soon. I don’t think he will be so nice to our president for very long. His policy toward China is not durable.”",
		"14" : "Others noted that it would be against China’s national security interests to side with the United States against North Korea. “I think this ends unhappily,” said Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “In the end, China is not going to deliver North Korea on our doorstep. China will say: ‘We’ve done these things. What are you so upset about?’ ”",
		"15" : "Mr. Trump, who likes to do business by phone, is acquiring a reputation for pestering Mr. Xi. He called the Chinese president four days after their summit meeting in Florida last month, saying afterward on Twitter that he had had “a very good call” with Mr. Xi about the “menace of North Korea.”",
		"16" : "He called again on April 23. Mr. Paal said he was told by Chinese officials that after that call, Mr. Xi did not appreciate being treated like a midlevel official. Mr. Trump should realize that the Chinese president sets the framework for policies but cannot be expected to keep a checklist of tasks, the officials told him.",
		"17" : "Still, Mr. Trump’s impulse to reach out to Mr. Xi is in the tradition of some of the smoothest moments of relations between the two countries, and it plays to China’s long-held preference to conduct policy through personal relationships.",
		"18" : "“Chinese leaders have demonstrated over and over again that they like to operate through personal relationships — like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with Henry Kissinger,” said James Mann, a fellow in residence at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the author of “About Face: A History of America’s Curious Relationship With China, From Nixon to Clinton.”",
		"19" : "“It’s a matter of Chinese culture,” Mr. Mann said, “but it also serves their interests, because personalized diplomacy helps them overcome the idea that China should be treated by the same impersonal rules and policies that apply everywhere else.”",
		"20" : "It is not unusual for a new American president to reach out to a foreign leader, even an adversarial one, in an attempt to break a pattern of the past.",
		"21" : "Early in his tenure, President George W. Bush praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, saying he had “looked the man in the eye. I found him very straightforward and trustworthy — I was able to get a sense of his soul.”",
		"22" : "Though they come from vastly different worlds, Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump were both born into privilege. Mr. Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, was a senior general under Mao during the civil war and helped the Communists come to power. Mr. Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump, was a major New York City builder who left a fortune to his son.",
		"23" : "Both men rely on a small group of people to help craft their decisions. For Mr. Xi, Li Zhanshu and Wang Huning, two secretive officials who travel with him everywhere, are said to be the most influential.",
		"24" : "For Mr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, outstrip everyone else. It is Mr. Kushner who has served as the go-between for Mr. Trump in his dealings with the Chinese.",
		"25" : "Mr. Xi has consistently shown contempt for Kim Jong-un and declined to meet with him, unlike Mr. Trump, who said Monday that he would meet with the North Korean leader if the circumstances were right.",
		"26" : "But Mr. Xi’s remoteness from Mr. Kim should not be taken to mean that he will do what Mr. Trump wants and force North Korea to change its behavior, Chinese analysts said.",
		"27" : "“There is no possibility for China to fix the situation,” said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “That’s because China does not want a nuclear-armed enemy in North Korea.”"

		"1" : "SYDNEY, Australia — Staff members at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, among the most powerful voices in the Australian news media, began a weeklong strike on Wednesday over job cuts at Fairfax Media.",
		"2" : "The walkout reflects the strains afflicting Australia’s news media, which faces the same digital challenges hurting the industry in the United States and other places.",
		"3" : "On Wednesday morning, the company sent an email to staff members saying it would cut 125 full-time positions at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne, with cuts also expected at The Australian Financial Review. Last month, Fairfax management said that the company would need to trim 30 million Australian dollars, or about $22.5 million, representing nearly one-quarter of its editorial budget.",
		"4" : "In his email to staff members on Wednesday, Sean Aylmer, the editorial director at Fairfax Media, said that all editorial sections could be affected but that some jobs would be hit especially hard.",
		"5" : "“While we will be looking across all parts of the newsroom, at the end of the redundancy program we expect there will be significantly fewer editorial management, video, presentation and section writer roles,” he wrote.",
		"6" : "A Fairfax spokesman said the company was “disappointed” with the journalists’ decision but would continue to publish its titles in print and online as usual during the strike. He declined to say how many workers had walked off the job.",
		"7" : "The newspapers that make up Fairfax Media have more than 150 years of history in Australia, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing dubious business practices and targeting criminal operations.",
		"8" : "Staff members interviewed said the latest round of cuts signified the decline of one of Australia’s most powerful media empires.",
		"9" : "“The fact that our newsroom is being cut by a quarter at least, some figures suggest more like a third, and they want us out the door in two weeks, is an enormous blow to journalism,” said Michael Bachelard, investigations editor at The Age. “It really shows the deep and sudden nature of these cuts.”",
		"10" : "Like other media organizations, Fairfax’s news outlets have been hit by the rise of digital news and tough competition for advertising dollars from Facebook and Google. News organizations based outside Australia have also increased their presence in the country, including BuzzFeed, which is based in New York, and The Guardian, which is based in London. This week The New York Times also announced an Australian expansion.",
		"11" : "Revenue from the Fairfax division that includes the papers fell 8 percent during the six months that ended in December, the company said in February.",
		"12" : "The Brisbane Times also went on strike on Wednesday.",
		"13" : "The strike would last until Wednesday, a day after the country’s federal budget is released. The budget typically receives heavy attention in the news media.",
		"14" : "Under Australian labor law, the country’s Fair Work Commission can order striking employees back to work. The Fairfax spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue that option.",
		"15" : "“The history of these strikes — and we’ve done a number over the years as the cuts have progressively gotten worse — is that management is still able to put out a newspaper,” Mr. Bachelard said. “But it’s a shadow of its former self.”",
		"16" : "Fairfax staff members posted photographs of empty newsrooms on social media after news of the strike. In Melbourne, staff members gathered and waved newspapers.",
		"17" : "Andrew Hornery, a senior journalist who has worked for The Sydney Morning Herald for 22 years and writes the Private Sydney column, stood outside his newsroom with co-workers and said: “It’s a great shame what’s happening. It’s death by a thousand cuts.”",
		"18" : "He added, “We find it really frustrating that after years and years of cuts, still the organization hasn’t been able to come up with a solution which doesn’t require cutting the very thing that we do, which is producing good-quality journalism.”"

		"1" : "PARIS — He said she was telling lies. She called him arrogant. He accused her of repeating “stupidities.” She cut him off and told him not to lecture her. He shook his head sadly, and she laughed sarcastically.",
		"2" : "The debate on Wednesday night between France’s two presidential candidates, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front and the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, was more like an angry American-style television shoutfest than the reasoned discussion of issues the French have become accustomed to. It was a study in violent verbal combat: The two talked angrily over each other, cut each other off, shook fists and pointed fingers, leaving the moderators bewildered and helpless.",
		"3" : "But it was also a stark demonstration of two radically different visions of France that voters will have to choose between on Sunday in the election’s final round. Mr. Macron, 39, the former banker and cool technocrat, educated at France’s finest schools and the beneficiary of a meteoric rise, faced off against Ms. Le Pen, 48, the scion of one of the country’s most notorious political families, the inheritor of a far-right party who has tried to move it toward the center.",
		"4" : "The two candidates did not hide their disdain for each other, and their total divergence on all the issues — Europe, terrorism, France’s stagnant economy, Russia — explained why.",
		"5" : "“The high priestess of fear is sitting in front of me,” Mr. Macron said derisively, having cast his opponent as a dangerous extremist with deep ties to her party’s dark past. He made a point of repeating her name, to remind viewers of her parental filiation: her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the National Front and is associated with its historical posture of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and stigmatization of immigrants.",
		"6" : "“You are the France of submission,” Ms. Le Pen said with scorn; Mr. Macron was merely a heartless banker, in her view. “We’ve seen the choice you’ve made, the cynical choices, that reveal the coldness of the investment banker you have never ceased being.”",
		"7" : "He leads her by 20 points in polls and is considered likely to win on Sunday. The debate is expected to move some voters, but not enough to make up for Ms. Le Pen’s substantial polling deficit. She has seen some slight improvement in recent polls and was clearly hoping to destabilize her younger opponent as she did in the first-round debates, when other candidates were present. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, she went for direct frontal attacks.",
		"8" : "But Mr. Macron generally kept his cool, laying out his program point by point through the shouting, while Ms. Le Pen, true to the scrappy, guerrilla-style party that she leads — it is stronger on combat than on policy — spent much of the two-and-a-half-hour contest attacking him. What policy proposals she offered appeared sketchy.",
		"9" : "Mr. Macron offered his view of a France open to Europe and free trade, staying in the common currency, reinforcing its ties with European nations, dealing firmly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and overhauling its stultifying and voluminous labor code in order, he said, to generate more jobs.",
		"10" : "“We are in the world,” Mr. Macron said. “France is not a closed country.”",
		"11" : "Ms. Le Pen depicted a France with a “total collapse of our industries,” preyed upon by Islamist extremists, demanding ever more government protection from economic vicissitudes and urgently needing to close its borders. “I’m the candidate of that France that we love, who will protect our frontiers, who will protect us from savage globalization,” she said at the outset.",
		"12" : "Mr. Macron was a ruthless capitalist in Ms. Le Pen’s familiar neo-populist depiction, ready to sell French industry down the river to hurt workers and help employers. She repeatedly tied Mr. Macron to the failed government of the incumbent Socialist president, François Hollande, in which Mr. Macron served for two years before quitting to start his own political movement.",
		"13" : "“You defend private interests,” Ms. Le Pen sneered. “And behind that there is social ruin.”",
		"14" : "Mr. Macron replied evenly, “What’s extraordinary is that your strategy is simply to say a lot of lies and propose nothing to help the country.” He pointed out the weaknesses in her generous spending plans, noting the lack of revenue-raising measures to back them. “France and the French deserve better,” he said. “Don’t say stupid things. You are saying a lot of them.”",
		"15" : "Some of the sharpest exchanges came over terrorism, which polls show is a major preoccupation for the French. Ms. Le Pen cast herself as tougher on the issue, reeling off a series of antiterrorism measures — experts have suggested that they are either impractical or ineffective — and saying Mr. Macron was a weakling on security. Nonetheless, it is one of her signature issues, always drawing a thunderous response when she invokes it at rallies. “You are for laxism,” Ms. Le Pen said.",
		"16" : "“You are complaisant toward Islamist fundamentalism,” she said. “We’ve got to eradicate fundamentalist ideologies. You won’t do it, because they support you.”",
		"17" : "Bristling, Mr. Macron pointed out the impracticality of expelling the thousands of people who are in the government’s so-called S-files because they are considered to constitute some potential danger to the country’s security. “The S-files are just information files,” Mr. Macron said. “You can be an S-filer merely for having crossed paths with a jihadist.”",
		"18" : "“You’ve got to be much more surgical than Ms. Le Pen,” he added. “What you are proposing, as usual, is merely powder,” he said, pointing out that as a member of the European Parliament, Ms. Le Pen voted repeatedly against antiterrorism measures.",
		"19" : "She dismissed these criticisms, as she did the entire European Union project. Under her, she said, “French laws will be superior to laws given out by some commissioner whose name we don’t even know.”",
		"20" : "Mr. Macron posited a diametrically opposed view, insisting that France’s place was in a stronger Europe that could stand up to Mr. Putin’s Russia and President Trump’s United States. Ms. Le Pen’s idea is that “we’re going to leave Europe because the others can make it, but we can’t,” he said. “In the face of this spirit of defeat, I am for the spirit of conquest, because France has always succeeded.”"

And sometimes her words also offered a shaft of light. “My dear compatriots, I’m not interested in your race, your origin, your sexual orientation,” she said. “What interests me is your happiness.”",
		"5" : "Now a global figure, a far-right populist who has threatened to bring down the European Union, Ms. Le Pen is at the threshold of power as France prepares for the final round of voting for president on Sunday. Her odds, judging by the polls, are long. But even if she does not succeed against the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, Ms. Le Pen is likely to be a powerful fixture of French politics for years to come. She is a political veteran, a fierce debater and perhaps the ablest campaigner in the entire French political spectrum.",
		"6" : "Yet she has made a risky bargain. She has cast off the xenophobic legacy of the National Front, and she has not. Her father never swayed from the hardest, most hate-filled of political lines. The daughter aspires to the presidency. She has made a very public campaign of “un-demonizing” — shedding the party’s bigoted heritage — even as skeptics still wonder if the effort is more tactical than genuine. Her unspoken gamble is that she can keep the National Front legacy even as she reassures millions of French that she has transcended it.",
		"7" : "When Donald J. Trump won the American presidential election, Ms. Le Pen suddenly seemed part of a global populist vanguard. But if that populist surge appears to be peaking — for now — it is also true that Ms. Le Pen is no Mr. Trump.",
		"8" : "Unlike him, she does not improvise her policies, which are the product of a decades-long honing of National Front ideology. That ideology is not sui generis, unlike Mr. Trump’s. Its roots are in classic French far-right thinking going back 100 years or more. Indeed, some reputable scholars think that France, not Italy, was the true birthplace of fascism at the turn of the 20th century.",
		"9" : "And she speaks in polished, complete sentences, informed by her training as a lawyer and by the advisers, some well versed in old French far-right doctrines, who surround her. She easily jousts with reporters, even while working a crowd, brushing off a British television reporter who questioned her electoral potential at one stop with a quotation from the right-wing Roman Catholic author George Bernanos.",
		"10" : "“She’s not cultivated, but she has a pretty extraordinary memory,” said Aymeric Chauprade, a member of the European Parliament and a onetime favorite of Ms. Le Pen’s who fell out with her. “She’s got a huge capacity to assimilate. She’s very skillful.”",
		"11" : "French economists, political analysts and think tanks are virtually united in predicting a crisis for France if Ms. Le Pen is elected. Her plan to take France out of the eurozone would lead to an immediate devaluation of any new national currency, with devastating effect on her core base of supporters, economists say. Her stigmatization of immigrants would exacerbate social tensions in already edgy suburbs.",
		"12" : "Yet in many parts of France, her appeal is undeniable. Hatred of the political establishment — seen as responsible for France’s economic stagnation, its persistent unemployment rate of 10 percent, its shuttered factories and its waves of immigrants — provides her with a powerful boost. In person and on the campaign trail, the twice-divorced mother of three conveys tough frankness in familiar, gravelly tones conditioned by years of smoking — an alluring combination to growing ranks of French voters.",
		"13" : "Her campaign posters are affixed across the country, subtle reminders of her efforts to run from the past. There is no mention of the National Front, and its associations with anti-Semitism, racism, and nostalgia for France’s collaboration with the Nazis. Even the Le Pen name, tied to her father, is absent. There is just her recognizable face and her recognizable given name, Marine. She is the brand; the National Front is the unspoken subtext of her politics.",
		"14" : "That recognition is the result of a life in the spotlight, if often in the shadow of her father, whose cronies once sneered at the young upstart, a wealthy heiress with a fondness for Champagne and parties — until she took leadership of the party from him in 2011 and cast him out in 2015.",
		"15" : "“She got up there with all her awkwardness, and she had a freshness, with her round cheeks,” Jean-Claude Martinez, one of her father’s old party associates, recalled of Ms. Le Pen’s early appearances in the news media, which thrust her into the national consciousness. “The world discovered her. She was born in the media.”",
		"16" : "At the raucous rallies that pack in thousands, many proudly trace their allegiance back to her overthrown father. But under the daughter, the National Front’s appeal has grown steadily. She got over seven million votes in the election’s first round, on April 23, a million more than in 2015 regional elections, and nearly two million more than her father received in 2002.",
		"17" : "“She’s permanently underestimated,” said Jean-Lin Lacapelle, a top aide and friend to Ms. Le Pen, with a long history of National Front activism. “Macron is the candidate of the system.”",
		"18" : "Her critics regard her as a dangerous nationalist and demagogue. Her supporters interpret her willingness to cast blame on “the system,” “the oligarchy” and especially immigrants as proof of her sincerity.",
		"19" : "“It’s the truthfulness with which she expresses herself,” said Michel Duvernet, a middle-aged shopkeeper from the southern town of Cogolin, explaining why he had come to Ms. Le Pen’s rally in the coastal city of St.-Raphaël in March.",
		"20" : "“Also, the simplicity of her words,” said Mr. Duvernet, praising Ms. Le Pen for putting her finger on what he called “the Islamic unbearableness of what we live every day,” in the speech she had just given.",
		"21" : "“Plus, she just reaches out to ordinary people,” he said.",
		"22" : "Raymond Herbreteau, a physical education coach from the Orne administrative department, who traveled to Ms. Le Pen’s rally in the western city of Nantes in February, spoke of Ms. Le Pen filling a new vacuum in French politics.",
		"23" : "“She sticks to the same line, of sovereignty,” Mr. Herbreteau said. “Besides, the left isn’t even the left any more. They’re for globalization and capitalism. More and more are convinced by her.”",
		"24" : "For the unconvinced, Ms. Le Pen has staged the elaborate “un-demonizing” of her party, as even her aides put it, in the full glare of the public spotlight. As ultimate proof, she presents an act of “violence,” as she put it in a television interview Sunday night: the expulsion of her own father from the party after yet another anti-Semitic outburst.",
		"25" : "“For the higher interest of the nation, you’ve got to be capable of hurting yourself,” she said. “And that did hurt me, because I am a daughter,” she told the interviewer, explaining her decision to get rid of her father.",
		"26" : "What part of it is sincere, and what part is mere political calculation?",
		"27" : "“For 40 years, she had been hearing exactly the same things” from her father, “and it did not bother her in the slightest,” said Mr. Martinez, Mr. Le Pen’s old associate.",
		"28" : "Her aides, often close personal friends in the National Front’s clannish culture, reject this view.",
		"29" : "“Le Pen is a man of the 19th century,” said Philippe Péninque, a former lawyer and consultant who is often described as Ms. Le Pen’s eminence grise. “And Marine is a woman thoroughly of her time.”",
		"30" : "“She’s got the French national heritage stapled to her being, but modernized,” he added.",
		"31" : "The record suggests a constant shifting back and forth: edging away from her father’s worldview, and then edging back toward it, or at least part of it.",
		"32" : "Her first big break with her father, in 2005, came after he called the German wartime occupation of France “not particularly inhumane.” Furious over his maintaining what she called a “counterproductive” strategy, she fled with her children to the family’s seaside villa and began writing her autobiography. Despite the split, she remained important in the party hierarchy.",
		"33" : "After 2010 regional elections, when Ms. Le Pen did well, she began to consolidate her hold on the National Front. That same year, she described the Muslim presence in France as an “occupation,” a remark that brought her to court on charges of inciting religious hatred.",
		"34" : "After she gained control of the party in 2011, she went on television to declare the Nazi camps “the height of barbarity” — a clear break with years of National Front policy.",
		"35" : "In the current campaign, she has repeatedly found herself on the defensive over the issue, clumsily denying France’s responsibility in a wartime roundup of Jews, and forced to accept the resignation of an interim party president whose old Holocaust-denying remarks had been dredged up. Ms. Le Pen called the reports a “defamation.”",
		"36" : "Mr. Péninque said the Parisian preoccupation with the National Front’s antecedents meant nothing to the electorate, and was actually helpful to the party. Opponents dredged up the issue “because they don’t have any other arguments. It’s not a debate. And it’s only going to help the Front.”",
		"37" : "Mr. Chauprade was more categorical. “She’s got an enormous capacity to lie,” he said."

	"content" : {
		"1" : "LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May kicked off the formal start of the British election campaign on Wednesday by accusing some in the European Union bureaucracy of misrepresenting the British position on exiting the bloc and even of trying to influence the election itself.",
		"2" : "“Britain’s negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the Continental press; the European Commission’s negotiating stance has hardened; threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials,” Mrs. May said sternly in front of 10 Downing Street immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace, where she informed the queen that Parliament had been dissolved for the June 8 election.",
		"3" : "“All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election,” she said, only a day after vowing to be a “bloody difficult woman” in negotiations about Britain’s departure from the European Union.",
		"4" : "Those negotiations are likely to take up to two years, if they succeed at all, but Mrs. May has presented herself as the “strong and stable” leader required for Britain to get its best possible deal for a future relationship with Brussels, in contrast to Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party.",
		"5" : "Mrs. May, who wants to win an increased majority for her Conservative Party in the election she called only two years after the last one, is trying to turn critical weekend leaks in the European news media about her negotiating stance to her advantage. She is portraying herself as standing tall for Britain while Brussels and the other European Union members gang up against her.",
		"6" : "And now she is accusing the Europeans of trying to manipulate the British election through leaks about a contentious dinner she hosted for the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, that went badly and showed Mrs. May in a poor light. But she seemed to be blaming the “bureaucrats in Brussels” more than the other heads of state and government who will have a vital say in any final deal, which must be unanimously agreed to by the other 27 member states of the European Union.",
		"7" : "But with hostile language coming so soon, concerns are likely to deepen that the negotiations on Britain’s exit, or “Brexit,” will founder and that Britain will leave the bloc with no agreement on future relations. That would not only create immense uncertainty for business, currencies, airlines and ordinary citizens — both Europeans living and working in Britain and Britons living in other countries of the bloc — but would almost certainly be economically damaging.",
		"8" : "Mr. Corbyn responded angrily to Mrs. May’s remarks, calling them electioneering. “By winding up the public confrontation with Brussels, the prime minister wants to wrap the Conservative Party in the Union Jack and distract attention from her government’s economic failure and rundown of our public services,” he said in a statement. “But Brexit is too important to be used as a political game in this election.”",
		"9" : "But to be sure, the British exit — how it will be negotiated, by whom and with what aims and results — is central to this election.",
		"10" : "Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats — the party that is most opposed to a British exit and wants Britons to vote again on any final deal — said as much on Tuesday: “This is a Brexit election and a chance to change the direction of Britain.”",
		"11" : "On Sunday, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung gave an insider’s account of the first working dinner last Wednesday at Downing Street between Mrs. May and her team and Mr. Juncker and his. Clearly the result of a leak from the commission — Britons generally blame Mr. Juncker’s chief of cabinet, Martin Selmayr, a German — the report described Mr. Juncker’s astonishment at the gap between the sides and his view that the British and Mrs. May were living in “a different galaxy.”",
		"12" : "Mr. Juncker was said to believe that Mrs. May did not understand the complexity of the task, the size of the “divorce settlement” Britain would have to pay or the European Union’s insistence that Britain negotiate a future relationship with the bloc only after the settlement was essentially completed.",
		"13" : "Earlier on Wednesday in Brussels, the European Union’s chief negotiator for the exit, Michel Barnier, laid out detailed priorities for the two years of talks, warning London to address the concerns of millions of people about their residency and pension rights and repeating that the divorce bill had to be settled before talks could start on a future trade relationship.",
		"14" : "Britain must “clear the accounts,” Mr. Barnier said, though the amount would have to be negotiated, and he refused to name a figure. But he listed obligations to the current budget, which runs past Britain’s exit, and commitments made to the European Investment Bank, European Central Bank and various aid funds. Britain would also be expected to pay its share of pension obligations and for the relocation of two European Union agencies currently housed in Britain.",
		"15" : "Mr. Barnier said that the 3.2 million European Union citizens in Britain and 1.2 million Britons living in other countries in the bloc could not be left in legal limbo and needed the assurances of lifetime residency and access to health care, social security and pension rights guaranteed by the European Court of Justice — a court whose jurisdiction Britain wants to abandon as part of its exit.",
		"16" : "The bloc has also emphasized the need to protect the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and to solve the problem of the post-exit border between Northern Ireland and Ireland “in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.”",
		"17" : "Mr. Barnier acknowledged that “there are differing positions which emerged during the dinner” last week, which he attended, but he said he wanted to build an “entente cordiale” between Britain and the bloc.",
		"18" : "A “shared passion” with Mrs. May for hiking and rambling in the mountains gave them a basis for good relations, he said. But, he added, “you also have to look out for accidents.”"

		"1" : "MOSCOW — Given the spotlight focused on Russia during the American presidential campaign and Donald J. Trump’s warm words as candidate for President Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin anticipated a starring role as foreign policy partner No. 1 under the Trump administration.",
		"2" : "Instead, while President Trump has been feting every Theresa, Justin and Abdel Fattah at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, including a high-profile dinner with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Putin has had to content himself with three measly telephone calls since the inauguration.",
		"3" : "“They feel slighted,” Vladimir Frolov, a prominent foreign policy analyst and columnist, said of the Russian leadership.",
		"4" : "For one thing, it looks bad at home. Mr. Putin, after all, sold Russian interventions in Ukraine and especially Syria as proof that Moscow was back on the global stage as the indispensable equal to the United States in world affairs, just as in the Soviet days.",
		"5" : "Second, it has left the Kremlin perplexed as to how it can move forward in its relations with Washington, especially as Russia slouches toward a presidential election campaign in March 2018, although Mr. Putin has not yet officially declared his candidacy for a fourth term.",
		"6" : "Worse, instead of heralding a new chapter in relations, Washington seems to be piling on the demands. Even anticipated friends like Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state awarded a medal by Mr. Putin when he was head of Exxon Mobil, have proved disappointing.",
		"7" : "Mr. Tillerson showed up in Moscow for his first trip as secretary of state last month only to start resurrecting positions that Moscow thought had been laid to rest with the Obama administration.",
		"8" : "Mr. Tillerson endorsed the idea that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia’s main friend in the Middle East, had to go, for example. The Trump administration has also made clear it wants Russia out of Ukraine, and an end to what it calls violations of a key missile treaty. It even dredged up Afghanistan again as an issue.",
		"9" : "Asked about Russia in an appearance on Fox News last Sunday, the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said he thought Mr. Putin was not serving Russia’s best interests. “We need changes in words and the nature of the relationship,” he said, “but what we really need to see is change in behavior.”",
		"10" : "Aleksei Pushkov, a well-known voice in foreign affairs in the Federation Council, tweeted in response that Mr. McMaster’s remarks were reminiscent of the Obama administration. “Counterproductive approach,” he wrote.",
		"11" : "The chain of similar statements from Washington has pretty much curdled the idea that there will be a grand bargain on global issues with Washington.",
		"12" : "Furthermore, according to some analysts, while Russia is eager for improved relations, the Trump administration has not exactly made clear what reward Russia might get for executing a major, across-the-board reversal in its foreign policy.",
		"13" : "“It has not detailed the definition in terms of what an improved relationship would be, in other words what is the bag of goodies in exchange for a dramatic U-turn in their foreign policy,” Mr. Frolov said.",
		"14" : "He added, “The Russians are basically scratching their heads and asking, ‘What are we going to get from this?’”",
		"15" : "In the third Trump-Putin call, on Tuesday night, the two presidents agreed to coordinate more closely on Syria and Korea, and possibly to meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in early July.",
		"16" : "The standard explanation in Russian circles for the cold shoulder from President Trump is that American foreign policy mandarins will not let Trump be Trump when it comes to Russia.",
		"17" : "“Trump rejected the idea of holding a separate meeting early due to fear of hysteria by his enemies in the USA,” Mr. Pushkov wrote on Twitter after the latest telephone call.",
		"18" : "Naturally, the idea that Presidents Trump and Putin are equals has not died entirely, either. “The third contact between the two presidents has confirmed that the Russian-American dialogue is not at a standstill, that both sides are interested in its development, and that it can proceed only on an equal footing,” Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the Federation Council, told Russian reporters on Wednesday, according to RIA Novosti, the state-operated news agency.",
		"19" : "Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, is expected to hold talks with Mr. Tillerson on the sidelines of an Arctic conference in Alaska next week, talks that the Russians are hoping might bring some clarity.",
		"20" : "There are things the Russians want, like the withdrawal of the American missile defense system in Romania and Poland, but nothing so specific has been broached. Mr. Trump’s effusive praise of the Russian leader while running for president has slowly faded as other issues have come to the fore, including multiple investigations into Russian meddling in last year’s presidential campaign and the stark differences over Syria’s use of chemical weapons against its own people again in April.",
		"21" : "On the other hand, Mr. Frolov noted, the Kremlin appreciates that the Trump administration has been largely silent on Russian domestic issues like violence against opposition leaders, arrests of political protesters and the persecution and torture of homosexuals in Chechnya.",
		"22" : "Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was not so reticent in her joint news conference with Mr. Putin on Tuesday, questioning the prosecution of civil society groups, homosexuals and religious sects while pooh-poohing Mr. Putin’s stance that the change of government in neighboring Ukraine had been undemocratic.",
		"23" : "The more discreet American approach indicates that Washington wants to keep channels open, Mr. Frolov said, so the Kremlin will most likely welcome a one-by-one approach to foreign policy issues rather than a grand bargain.",
		"24" : "Russia is looking for an agreement in Syria in particular, because Mr. Putin wants to avoid any violent surprises from there once the Russian presidential campaign begins in earnest at the end of 2017.",
		"25" : "Both sides are aware of the dangers of letting any confrontations between them overheat. There remains the risk of a collision in Syria, noted Dmitri V. Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, but there is also room for a deal on a diplomatic solution there.",
		"26" : "Mr. Putin repeated at news conferences two days running that the United States would be instrumental in solving the Syria problem, noting on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had endorsed the idea of safety zones that Russia began formally pushing as part of a new round of Syrian peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday. Mr. Trump dispatched a high-level American diplomat to the talks.",
		"27" : "“Optimists in Moscow and Washington hope that the U.S.-Russian relationship wouldn’t decline any further,” Mr. Trenin wrote in a piece on the Carnegie website.",
		"28" : "It is premature to expect outright cooperation, he and others said, predicting that relations might remain where they are until the terms of engagement are hammered out. That might take a meeting between the two presidents in Hamburg, they noted, assuming that Mr. Trump finally stops shunning Mr. Putin there."

		"2" : "President Trump, however, is not daunted by the challenge of bringing together Israelis and Palestinians. “It’s something that, I think, is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years,” he said on Wednesday.",
		"3" : "Whatever else may be said of him, Mr. Trump does not suffer from a confidence deficit. As he hosted the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Trump proclaimed that he would be the president who finally makes peace in the Middle East. “We will get this done,” he said. He even suggested that, with his leadership, “hopefully there won’t be such hatred for very long.”",
		"4" : "Never mind that he also thought repealing and replacing his predecessor’s health care program would be “so easy.” Or that he predicted he would have no trouble bending North Korea to his will, or forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall. Then there was Mr. Trump’s assertion as a candidate that he knew more about the Islamic State than the generals. And his insistence that he could “fairly quickly” pay off the entire $19 trillion national debt accumulated over the last 182 years.",
		"5" : "Braggadocio, of course, has been at the center of Mr. Trump’s persona for decades, and arguably helped make him into a swaggering celebrity real estate tycoon and reality television star with enough appeal to win the presidency. In the White House, though, it has historically been more problematic. Presidents who make bold predictions often come to regret them. All Mr. Trump would have to do is ask those who, for decades, have banged their heads against the Middle East brick wall.",
		"6" : "“When the president says we’ll do this deal, he thinks in terms of a one-off real estate deal,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator who spent years trying to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. “And while that’s partly true,” the specific issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians “transcend the ‘art of the deal’ in ways I’m not sure he can now even begin to imagine.”",
		"7" : "Mr. Trump’s introduction to Mr. Abbas made that plain. The president said he would do “whatever is necessary” to negotiate an agreement without offering any sense of how he intends to do that, or what such an agreement might look like.",
		"8" : "Mr. Abbas, by contrast, repeated the conditions the Palestinians have insisted on for years — the creation of an independent Palestinian state based on borders that existed before the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the right of return for refugees; and freedom for prisoners in Israeli cells. That formulation has been a nonstarter for Israel, which itself has shown no sign of backing off its own fixed positions.",
		"9" : "Mr. Trump has made clear that details do not matter to him, abandoning the longtime American commitment to the so-called two-state solution. When he hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in February, Mr. Trump said he would be fine with either a two-state or a one-state solution if both sides agreed. Palestinians hoping he might be more supportive of the two-state plan with Mr. Abbas were disappointed when Mr. Trump made no mention of it on Wednesday.",
		"10" : "“We want to create peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said. “We will get it done. We will be working so hard to get it done.”",
		"11" : "Turning to Mr. Abbas, he added, “I think there’s a very, very good chance, and I think you feel the same way.”",
		"12" : "Mr. Abbas, 82, who was among the negotiators at the signing of the Oslo Accords on the White House lawn in 1993, indicated that he did feel optimistic that, nearly a quarter-century later, Mr. Trump might finally build on that initial agreement to forge a final resolution.",
		"13" : "Praising Mr. Trump’s “courageous stewardship,” “wisdom” and “great negotiating ability,” Mr. Abbas said, “We believe that we can be partners, true partners, to you to bring about a historic peace treaty.”",
		"14" : "Mr. Abbas implored Mr. Trump to understand the Palestinian perspective. “It’s about time for Israel to end its occupation of our people and of our land after 50 years,” he said. “We are the only remaining people in the world that still live under occupation. We are aspiring and want to achieve our freedom, our dignity and our right to self-determination.”",
		"15" : "Echoing Israel’s position, Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Abbas to discourage Palestinian instigation against Israelis. “There cannot be lasting peace unless the Palestinian leaders speak in a unified voice against incitement to violence and hate,” Mr. Trump said. He did not publicly mention Palestinian financial payments to the families of convicted terrorists, but his spokesman, Sean Spicer, said Mr. Trump raised the issue privately.",
		"16" : "Mr. Abbas insisted that Palestinians were not preaching hatred. “I affirm to you that we are raising our youth, our children, our grandchildren on a culture of peace,” he said, a contention Israeli officials would reject.",
		"17" : "By all accounts, Mr. Trump seems genuinely determined to pursue Middle East peace and has assigned his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his longtime lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, to lead the effort. The president may visit Israel this month before a scheduled trip to Europe.",
		"18" : "Mr. Trump seems drawn to the idea of succeeding where others have failed. “Over the course of my lifetime, I’ve always heard that perhaps the toughest deal to make is the deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s see if we can prove them wrong.”",
		"19" : "Yet few think conditions are ripe. Aging and unpopular, Mr. Abbas may not have the clout to deliver even if he were willing to make concessions. Similarly, Mr. Netanyahu, now in his fourth term and under corruption investigations, faces significant pressure from his political right not to make a deal, and does not seem especially eager to do so anyway. Both leaders have an interest in making Mr. Trump think they are serious even if they are not.",
		"20" : "“I think the Palestinian calculation is that they can follow this further than Netanyahu can,” said Grant Rumley, the co-author of “The Last Palestinian,” a biography of Mr. Abbas to be published in July. “I think they expect that when the time comes to resist or say no to Trump, as it inevitably will for both leaders, that Abbas can do so and still maintain his grip on power, while the same likely cannot be said for Netanyahu.”",
		"21" : "John Hannah, senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who served as former Vice President Dick Cheney’s national security adviser, said failure has a cost. “The peace process is nothing if not a huge diplomatic time suck,” he said. “And the more time the president and his top advisers spend trying to push this particular rock up that hill, the less time they are focused on addressing the profound strategic challenges like Iran, ISIS and Al Qaeda.”",
		"22" : "Still, Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a pro-peace lobbying group in Washington, said “there’s a scenario where this falls into his lap later in his term, not necessarily because of the brilliance of his diplomacy.” With Sunni Arab states aligned with Israel in the regional struggle with Iran, he said, pressure may build for a resolution to the Palestinian question.",
		"23" : "If nothing else, Mr. Ben-Ami said, not being steeped in the details has advantages. “People who’ve been hardened by 20 or 30 years of doing this may think they know it all and they come in with their preconceived approach and it doesn’t work,” he said. “So maybe this is better.”"

		"1" : "BEIRUT, Lebanon — Russia is circulating a draft proposal to Syrian rebel groups and diplomats that envisions pausing the war in Syria through the creation of safe “de-escalation zones,” with outside troops possibly acting as buffers between the antagonists.",
		"2" : "The draft proposal, shared with The New York Times on Wednesday by participants at Syria talks held in Astana, Kazakhstan, is one of the most detailed suggestions to emerge in recent months in the rocky negotiations to halt the war, now in its seventh year.",
		"3" : "The proposal would apply to Syrian government and rebel forces in the four main areas of the country where insurgents unaffiliated with the Islamic State still hold significant territory.",
		"4" : "But it faces a number of challenges, most notably acceptance by the Syrian government and the insurgent groups attending the talks.",
		"5" : "The insurgent groups suspended participation in the talks on Wednesday to protest what they described as heavy bombing by the Syrian government’s Russian-backed forces the day before that killed dozens, including civilians.",
		"6" : "The Russian proposal does not specify measures to prevent government warplanes from carrying out such bombings. Rebels said they remained suspicious of Russian guarantees, regardless, because Russia has been unable or unwilling to curb government attacks on civilians.",
		"7" : "President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that the proposal had the backing not only of Russia but also of Iran, another ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and Turkey, which backs some anti-Assad groups.",
		"8" : "“We as guarantors — Turkey, Iran, Russia — will do everything for this to work,” Mr. Putin said in remarks carried on Russian television, speaking in Sochi, Russia, after meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.",
		"9" : "The proposal was made as the United States, another supporter of some anti-Assad groups, appeared to be re-engaging in the negotiations after a prolonged absence.",
		"10" : "Stuart E. Jones, the acting assistant secretary of state, was in Astana, the most senior American official to participate in Syria talks since President Trump took office.",
		"11" : "He arrived after Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin held a phone conversation on Tuesday about renewing efforts to resolve the conflict, which has left hundreds of thousands dead and half the population displaced.",
		"12" : "The draft proposal calls for “de-escalation zones” of safety to be established in four areas: Idlib Province, almost entirely held by jihadist and other rebel groups; Eastern Ghouta, a large area of the Damascus suburbs besieged by government forces; a besieged pocket north of the central city of Homs; and southern Syria along the Jordanian border, where rebel groups backed by the United States and its allies have made gains in recent months against both Islamic State and government forces.",
		"13" : "Under the proposal, checkpoints ringing those areas would be maintained by both government and rebel forces to allow the free movement of civilians and relief aid. That provision could offer respite from siege warfare, which has been a main weapon of the government.",
		"14" : "The proposal also says rebel groups would be required to fight the Islamic State and the formerly Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, now called Tahrir al-Sham, which are not part of any peace process.",
		"15" : "But the proposal offers few details on how fighting would be thwarted inside the secure zones.",
		"16" : "An earlier draft circulated by some opposition members included a provision that Syria’s air force would be grounded in those zones — but no mention is made of that provision in a longer draft. It was removed, participants said, because of Syrian government objections. But without that provision, rebels would probably reject the proposal.",
		"17" : "Analysts in Damascus close to the government of Mr. Assad said the government had rejected any proposal that would accept rebel control of any area, even temporarily. The government has long insisted that it aims to take back all of the country, and it has so far refused any territorial or political compromise with its opponents.",
		"18" : "The proposal raises the possibility of outside forces’ helping to guarantee a cease-fire. It says military units or “guarantors” would be deployed as monitors.",
		"19" : "Rebel representatives said they would not accept any from Iran or Russia. Russian news outlets, including the Interfax news agency, said the forces could be from former Soviet states — Kazakhstan was floated as a possibility — or members of the bloc of emerging economies that include Russia, Brazil and India. Those reports also mentioned Arab countries, leading to speculation that Egypt could contribute. Egyptian officials have denied any intention of sending forces to Syria.",
		"20" : "Changes on the ground in Syria have given credence to the possibility of cease-fire zones as outlined in the Russian proposal. On Tuesday, pro-government militias opened a new commercial corridor between government and rebel-held areas in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh in southern Syria, imposing a tax of 20 percent. The tax essentially formalized smuggling routes that have profited militants on both sides and could presage the opening of routes in other areas.",
		"21" : "Hisham Skeif, a former member of the opposition council in Aleppo and now a political spokesman for a rebel faction, was skeptical of the Russian proposal, saying it needed clarification on the precise boundaries of the cease-fire zones and the identities of the monitoring forces.",
		"22" : "“It was thrown by the Russians as a step in the air,” he said. Russia and the government have typically described rebel fighters as jihadists as a justification to bomb them, he said, “so we are back to the same vortex.”"

		"2" : "MAY THE FIRTH BE WITH YOU on BritBox. While the rest of the galaxy celebrates Star Wars Day, BritBox, the streaming site for British television, is celebrating a different kind of force — Colin Firth — with a few of his television roles. Top of the lineup: “Pride and Prejudice,” the 1995 BBC adaptation that turned a wet-shirted Mr. Firth into a sex symbol. “The scene — in which Mr. Firth’s character, Mr. Darcy, bumps into Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) after taking an impetuous swim on his estate — caused serious chest palpitations among those viewers who were not dead, and remains perhaps the only time a man dressed in a damp, puffy white blouse has ever looked truly hot on screen,” Sarah Lyall wrote in The New York Times. Other morsels include Mr. Firth in an early role as a witness in “Crown Court” (1984); as a motherless young man who joins his uncle’s magic act in “Lost Empires” (1986); as a field hockey player who forgets his match while chasing the opposite sex through the Netherlands in “Dutch Girls” (1985); as a filmmaker obsessed with the perfect love in “The Play on One: Out of the Blue” (1991); and as a London banker who starts doling out his wealth to the needy in “Born Equal” (2006).",

		"1" : "As President Trump ended his first 100 days in office last week, I found myself in China, a good place to judge how he has transformed the presidency’s bully pulpit.",
		"2" : "During the campaign, Mr. Trump denounced Chinese trade policies, saying he would not allow Beijing “to rape our country” any longer. In early April, when President Trump met President Xi Jinping of China at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., he continued the tough talk. He and his aides told the Chinese delegation that the administration would impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States if Beijing did not lower its barriers to American investments in China.",
		"3" : "It is too soon to tell whether the Chinese will change their policies. But there are signs that the president’s antagonistic approach has opened the door to strategic cooperation on one of the world’s biggest problems: North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.",
		"4" : "China already has suspended coal imports from Pyongyang in compliance with United Nations sanctions, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that China would impose more sanctions if North Korea continues its nuclear testing program. China’s foreign ministry spokesman said last week, “I can say in terms of solving the North Korean crisis, China’s efforts can’t be overstated.”",
		"5" : "There are also signs that Mr. Trump’s style is resonating with ordinary Chinese. Considering the harshness of his past statements about China, I was surprised by the number of people I met there who expressed respect for him. “He is a very successful businessman,” one said. “He is strong,” another said. One person noted, “I think in the past your country respected such people.”",
		"6" : "Apparently, the Chinese never took Mr. Trump’s campaign rhetoric personally. They saw it as his starting point — a “negotiating position,” as Mr. Trump himself might say.",
		"7" : "At home, President Trump is garnering far less reverence. Our political and media elites, along with Democratic critics, see Mr. Trump as overly provocative, unbalanced and lacking in any real results. They point to his thin legislative record.",
		"8" : "But those critics have failed to appreciate how Mr. Trump’s strong positions on foreign policy have had a positive impact. The president has put North Korea on notice while bolstering South Korea with the Thaad missile defense system. Even as he has voiced support for NATO, he has continued to demand that its members pay their fair share for defense — likely a factor in Germany’s decision to increase its troop strength.",
		"9" : "Struck by the inhumanity of Syria’s use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians, the president struck back in a measured way, ordering a strike of 59 Tomahawk missiles. Rogue actors like President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his Iranian benefactors have been warned.",
		"10" : "Mr. Trump has also shown the ability to learn on the job, having become a realist toward Russia and shown new caution in dealings with two allies, Turkey and Israel. On Iran, he has expressed flexibility regarding the nuclear deal he once denounced.",
		"11" : "Mr. Trump has also used his White House platform to begin changing sclerotic domestic policies and politics. In shaking the tree, he is causing old leaves to fall even as healthy ones remain in place, still strong.",
		"12" : "Simply by stepping up enforcement against undocumented workers, he has caused word to spread south of the border. Today, apprehensions of people crossing the southwest border illegally from Mexico are down 61 percent from January.",
		"13" : "The president’s policies have created a virtual wall, one that may obviate the need for the $20 billion eyesore after all.",
		"14" : "Mr. Trump has also already forced American companies to think twice about exporting jobs. And one conservative organization estimates his efforts to eliminate onerous and expensive regulations could save American businesses and consumers $60 billion or more.",
		"15" : "I know some of Mr. Trump’s proposals seem frightening to many people. His budget calls for draconian cuts, such as reducing State Department spending by 28 percent and eliminating federal support for beloved programs like PBS and the National Endowment for the Arts.",
		"16" : "His tax plan also might look as if it benefits mainly wealthy individuals and businesses, slashing the corporate tax rate to just 15 percent, from 35 percent.",
		"17" : "But remember, for Mr. Trump these things are opening bids. Knowing him as I do, as a friend, I can imagine a more modest final budget that leaves most programs intact and compromises on a corporate tax rate of 25 percent. At the end of the day, Donald Trump is a dealmaker.",
		"18" : "At 70, he is also not about to change. He won’t stop saying things that rub people the wrong way. And he will not stop tweeting — nor should he (though perhaps there should be a process for reviewing his tweets before posting). His theatrical persona, his rallies and his hyperbolic tweets have become the “big stick” he waves from his transformed bully pulpit.",
		"19" : "Through his message he has moved markets, steered global business in a better direction for American companies and defended American workers. He has also put bad actors, domestic and foreign, on notice.",
		"20" : "Even I do not agree with everything the president says or does. But we should be willing to recognize that, at times, he can be very effective. The Chinese have."

	"source" : "NYT",
	"url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/opinion/noncompete-agreements-workers.html?ref=todayspaper",
	"content" : {
		"1" : "Americans, we are told, believe in competition. But a shockingly large number of workers — 30 million, according to a report from the Treasury Department — are shackled by what are called “noncompetes,” which are agreements forbidding employees to leave their job to work for a competitor or to start their own competing business. And the number is growing fast.",
		"2" : "Once reserved for a corporation’s most treasured rainmakers, noncompetes are now routinely applied to low-wage workers like warehouse employees, fast-food workers and even dog sitters. One out of every six workers without a college degree have signed one. By including them in employee contracts, employers can use the threat of litigation to constrict wages and employee mobility.",
		"3" : "Noncompete agreements, like other anti-competitive practices, poison our economy in larger, less tangible ways. There is strong data showing that they reduce employee motivation, entrepreneurship and sharing of knowledge, the fundamental building blocks of innovation and economic growth.",
		"4" : "At a minimum every state should ban noncompetes for all low-wage workers, for all workers in occupations that promote public safety and health, such as physicians and nurses, and for all workers who are laid off or terminated without cause. Looking forward, the research suggests that noncompetes should be banned for all employees, regardless of skill, industry or wage; they simply do more harm than good.",
		"5" : "In 2016, the Obama White House issued a Call for Action urging states, and Congress, to push back against the overwhelming expansion of noncompetes (full disclosure: I was part of the White House’s working group on noncompetes). Vice President Joe Biden collected testimonies of workers bound by noncompetes: a Nebraska teacher who couldn’t take a summer job selling pet food because of her job the previous summer; a 56-year-old Connecticut salesman who was forced to retire because of a noncompete clause; a woman in Ohio who left an abusive marriage and was then threatened with lawsuits for taking an entry-level sales job with a new employer.",
		"6" : "Because laws governing noncompetes vary from state to state, we can analyze the effects of these kinds of contracts on wages, competition and labor mobility. The evidence shows wages in states that enforce noncompetes are 10 percent lower than in states that restrict their use. The Treasury Department concluded in its recent report that “by reducing workers’ job options, noncompete agreements force workers to accept lower wages in their current jobs, and may sometimes induce workers to leave their occupations entirely, forgoing accumulated human capital.”",
		"7" : "Workers bound by noncompetes cannot rely on outside offers and free-market competition to fairly value their talents. Without incentives to increase wages in-house, companies can allow salaries to plateau. And while noncompete restrictions impose hardships on every worker, for women these restrictions tend to be compounded with other mobility constraints, including the need to coordinate dual careers, family geographical ties and job market re-entry after family leave.",
		"8" : "California and Massachusetts offer a case study within the high-tech industry. California strictly voids all noncompete agreements. Massachusetts, like most other states, enforces noncompetes. Both California and Massachusetts enjoyed an early boom of economic growth within the high-tech market, but California’s Silicon Valley has continued growing, while Massachusetts has sputtered.",
		"9" : "Unlike in Silicon Valley, the employees of the Massachusetts tech companies were bound by noncompete agreements, and the enforcement of those agreements kept out new businesses by preventing people most likely to start new businesses — experienced former employees — from staying in the region. Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley, entrepreneurial activity flourished; thanks to California’s refusal to enforce all noncompetes (including those from other jurisdictions), it remains the tech center of the world.",
		"10" : "Some states, including Colorado, Oregon, Illinois and New York, have recently introduced reforms. Hawaii passed a law in 2015 prohibiting noncompetes in the tech industry.",
		"11" : "Federally, Congress introduced two bills last year — the Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act (Ladder Act) and the Mobility and Opportunity for Vulnerable Employees Act (MOVE Act).",
		"12" : "The best companies already realize the damaging effect of post-employment restrictions. Companies with little turnover risk becoming stagnant and myopic. In fact, relying on noncompetes rather than active recruitment and retention creates a market for lemons — a business will end up with employees who stay despite their unhappiness.",
		"13" : "Smart leaders treat departing employees as alums, rather than sour exes in a divorce. But too many other employers have become increasingly litigious against their former employees, relying on noncompetes rather than positive incentives to retain the best talent and curtail the competition.",
		"14" : "The liberty to move in the job market not only supports workers’ choice, equality and wage growth but also creates the competition that catalyzes entrepreneurship, innovation and overall economic growth. If we want a healthy and free market, we should not shackle workers to the first business that offers them a job. Let them compete."

		"1" : "The news out of Pennsylvania Station lately has been very, very bad. A train derails, taking out some switches, shutting tracks and snarling travel for days. A power line fails and service stops again, sending thousands of riders shuttling between rage and despair. A rumor of gunshots sets off a panic among waiting passengers, who run through the station like spooked cattle.",
		"2" : "It has come to this, in a subterranean station that is already one of the most claustrophobic, confusing and spirit-throttling spaces in the city. All that suffering, now with stampedes.",
		"3" : "There’s no disputing that Penn Station is broken. The question is: Who is going to fix it?",
		"4" : "That job mainly belongs to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the New York subways and the Long Island Rail Road, the primary users of the station along with Amtrak and New Jersey Transit.",
		"5" : "As Michael Kimmelman explained in The Times on Monday, Mr. Cuomo has a plan for Penn, but it falls short of the radical intervention that the blighted hub so badly needs. Most of it takes place across the street, on the other side of Eighth Avenue, where Mr. Cuomo has been turning the grand but obsolete Farley Post Office into a new arrival hall for Amtrak. That will move an estimated 20 percent of 650,000 daily riders out of Penn — a good step, but not a transformative one. A vast majority of the riders who stay put will see some modest improvements to the dungeon: a wider concourse and better signage and LED lighting on the ceiling meant to evoke blue sky and clouds. This may make the station slightly less unpleasant, but it will still be dangerously crowded, poorly designed and inadequate: a mass-transit disgrace.",
		"6" : "Real sky and clouds, let alone a little fresh air and room to move, won’t be an option as long as Penn remains as is, buried under Madison Square Garden. The best-laid plans for Penn have long involved persuading the Garden’s owners, the Dolan family, to leave their aging, inefficient arena for one that could be housed within the Farley building. Mr. Cuomo meets such suggestions with protestations that it can’t be done.",
		"7" : "But not everybody believes that persuading the Dolans to move is so impossible. One of the most heartening — in fact thrilling — developments in the long Penn Station impasse has been the arrival of another renewal plan, so vastly better than anything that came before it that it’s a shame Mr. Cuomo hasn’t embraced it.",
		"8" : "It comes from Vishaan Chakrabarti, an architect and professor at Columbia University, who, after being approached by The Times’s Op-Ed page, came up with a plan last year. He proposed moving the Garden but saving its skeleton, turning the squat concrete cylinder into a pavilion of glass and air, flooded with sunlight, with a glorious map on the ceiling showing the street grid, an echo of the glowing ceiling of constellations at Grand Central Terminal across town. More important, this would clean up the mess below ground, reordering the way concourses and tracks connect with subways and streets — essential preparation for the day when new Hudson River rail tunnels dump ever more passengers into what is now a suffocating, pillar-choked maze.",
		"9" : "Repurposing the Garden’s bones would cost far less than building a station from scratch. It would also reconnect the station with the neighborhood, which was one of the reasons Community Board 5, which advises on the area’s land use issues, unanimously endorsed the plan. It praised its “extraordinary vision and creativity, for achieving the goal of dramatically improving safety, light, air and pedestrian circulation conditions to Penn Station, while allowing for a new, state-of-the-art Madison Square Garden inside an existing historic resource.”",
		"10" : "Mr. Kimmelman warned that the governor was missing an opportunity to solve “the whole panoply of problems” at Penn, the way shortsighted politicians like former Gov. George Pataki of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey have done with other transit projects before.",
		"11" : "Penn Station is the busiest train station in America and by far the most miserable. It is the product of a cascade of governmental failures — of design and basic maintenance, but also of political will and imagination. Instead of defending his plan, Mr. Cuomo would be better off fixing it. He should concentrate his efforts on where the problem is — on removing Madison Square Garden and building a new Penn Station instead of touching up a dungeon. Mr. Chakrabarti has given him the blueprint."

		"3" : "Yet today, Susan Burton is a national treasure. She leads a nonprofit helping people escape poverty and start over after prison, she’s a powerful advocate for providing drug treatment and ending mass incarceration — and her life story is testimony to the human capacity for resilience and recovery.",
		"4" : "America’s greatest failure in the 21st century may be that far too many children grow up in a twilight zone of poverty, chaos, violence, drugs and failing schools. We can’t afford to help them, we say, and then we spend billions of dollars building prisons to house them.",
		"5" : "Burton, now 65, has co-written a stunning memoir that will be published next week, detailing how after overcoming narcotics she eventually founded a nonprofit, called A New Way of Life Re-entry Project, to help women leaving prison. In a preface of the book, Michelle Alexander, a civil rights advocate, describes Burton as a 21st-century Harriet Tubman, and there’s something to that.",
		"6" : "The memoir is called “Becoming Ms. Burton,” and that’s the journey it describes. As a black girl growing up in a dysfunctional family in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, Burton was repeatedly raped, and then her child was run over and killed by a policeman. She self-medicated with alcohol, cocaine and crack.",
		"7" : "“After six prison commitments, at the end of those, I was more broken than when I went into the system,” she told me. “Each time I was released, I would say I’m going to get it together, but each time it was more daunting.”",
		"8" : "Her cycles in prison ended only after she chanced into a drug treatment program in Santa Monica that mostly served a more affluent clientele. A 100-day stint there helped her turn her life around — a reminder that America would be far better off if we treated addiction as less a criminal justice issue than a public health crisis. That’s particularly true now that some 52,000 Americans die annually from drug overdoses, more than 10 times the number who died in the entire Iraq war.",
		"9" : "Starting in 1998, Burton began to help other women leaving prison, providing them with shelter and coaching them on staying sober and finding jobs. The effort was an immediate success, and philanthropists took note.",
		"10" : "When Theodore Forstmann asked her to make a list of what she needed, Burton initially wrote down “toilet paper.” A friend explained that Forstmann was a billionaire, and Burton upped the ante to request a van, and Forstmann came through.",
		"11" : "Burton now has 28 staff members, including six lawyers. She runs five homes for 32 women who have left prison, and has been recognized as a CNN Hero — and she burns with a passion to help other women find an exit ramp as well.",
		"12" : "“We keep a woman in prison for decade after decade at a cost of $60,000 a year, and then give them $200 when they hit the gates for release,” she said, shaking her head. “And, adios. People have to get their IDs, Social Security cards. They have to get clothing, housing, apply for benefits and services, and it’s impossible to do with 200 bucks.”",
		"13" : "The upshot, she said, is that people re-offend — and then get locked up once more, at a huge expense.",
		"14" : "Burton showed me the homes she has set up, and the women in them are a reminder of how difficult it can be to start over after years in prison. One woman, Unique, confided that she hears voices in her head shouting at her, and Burton asked her why she didn’t keep a doctor’s appointment. “I’m afraid to go out,” Unique explained, so Burton worked out an escort so that Unique could see the doctor and get her medicines.",

Now 53, she had been behind bars for her entire adult life and has never had an official ID card. With Burton’s help she is getting one and looking for a job. But Mitchell has forgotten how to walk in a city.",

		"19" : "So I’m celebrating Burton’s new book and amazing second career — but with a bittersweet feeling that there are so many other Susan Burtons out there who never get the help or drug treatment they need, and are still incarcerated in ways that diminish them and all of America."

		"1" : "Oh gosh, we’ve got another Trump.",
		"2" : "This has been very difficult, people. Every day concerned citizens put together their critique of the president’s policies, and before nighttime he’s a completely different dude.",
		"3" : "You remember the Somewhat Normal Republican Trump, who answers to both SNORE and SNORT, depending on his energy level at the moment. He mainly likes to repeal federal regulations — free mentally ill people to buy guns; don’t let a little clean water stand between coal owners and their yen to dump trash. Last week SNORT issued a tax reform plan that was classic G.O.P. in its extreme vagueness on how to pay for its multitude of cuts. (“Eliminate tax breaks for special interests.”)",
		"4" : "Then suddenly, out of nowhere, came Weirdly Liberal Trump (WELT). He mused about breaking up the big banks; special aide Ivanka plugged helping Syrian refugees. Liberal Trump even expressed interest in a gas tax hike to pay for infrastructure repairs.",
		"5" : "“It’s something that I would certainly consider,” he told Bloomberg News. The idea of a Republican administration, bound at the hip to the energy industry, championing a gas tax hike is a little stunning. It would, of course, pay for a ton of construction jobs, repair crumbling roads and bridges and be great for the environment. But I guarantee you Mike Pence would never bring it up.",
		"6" : "Perhaps we should rethink all that impeachment talk.",
		"7" : "Lately Congress has been in an uproar over health care, and House Speaker Paul (My Life Is Ruined) Ryan is going crazy trying to placate both sides on the matter of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. WELT wants to be the progressive hero. “Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be,’” Trump told CBS’s John Dickerson.",
		"8" : "That was shortly before Trump went off the handle when Dickerson asked about his claims of being wiretapped by Barack Obama. “I don’t stand by anything,” Trump said, unnecessarily, before he tossed Dickerson out of the Oval Office for pressing him on the matter.",
		"9" : "Viewers got to witness a transformation from the new liberal presidential version to the very familiar Nearly Unhinged Trump (NUT). Actually, this one often seems more along the line of Totally Unhinged, but then we’d have to call him TUT.",
		"10" : "It’s generally pretty easy to tell which president is talking. NUT was the one who thought Andrew Jackson could have stopped the Civil War. So, for sure, was the Trump who expressed astonishment that being president was harder work than his previous jobs. (“I thought it would be easier.”)",
		"11" : "NUT tends to reside in the world of Twitter. And sometimes he fights with his other versions. Weirdly Liberal Trump was very happy when Congress came up with a spending deal that guarantees the government will continue operating through the summer. (“This is what winning looks like!”) Nearly Unhinged hated hated hated it.",
		"12" : "“Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” twittered NUT. He had promised us he’d make history, but even his critics didn’t expect he’d do it by becoming the first American president to express a yearning for the government to come to a screeching halt.",
		"13" : "The quick shift between Trumps is always a challenge to the minions in charge of interpreting him to the world. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who is getting to be one of our very favorite explainers, said that the president was calling for a shutdown because he became “frustrated” when Democrats expressed pleasure at the resolution of the spending standoff. (“They went out to try and spike the football and make him look bad.”) In reality, Mulvaney insisted, the Democrats were hoping for a collapse in negotiations because they wanted “to make this president look like he did not know what he was doing.”",
		"14" : "And the whole world mused: not a hard lift.",
		"15" : "Neither the liberal nor the normal-Republican Trump is very good at interesting new ideas that might actually, in the real world, happen. Unhinged Trump is obviously the attention-getter, and a lot of the excitement comes from the fact that his proposals are often exactly the opposite of whatever he was championing last week.",
		"16" : "He’s also unfettered by the restrictions in imagination that would come from previous knowledge of how government operates. It appears, for instance, that NUT was surprised by the discovery that it took 60 votes to pass most legislation in the Senate. This came out in a tweet expressing shock, shock, shock that 41 senators could force the majority into compromise. “Either elect more Republican senators in 2018 or change the rule now to 51 percent,” he recommended.",
		"17" : "Senate Republicans dismissed the idea instantly. “We are not going to do that,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Most of them had spent much of the Obama administration happily thwarting a Democratic president’s agenda with that very rule. Perhaps some of them were already anticipating that by 2021, it would come in handy again."

		"2" : "Jacob deGrom is the best able-bodied starter the Mets have now, and he was off to a strong start this year despite coming off a season-ending operation on his elbow in September. But he cannot carry the team alone.",
		"3" : "So when he struggled in Wednesday’s 16-5 win over the Atlanta Braves, the Mets’ offense picked up the slack. A home-run-loving lineup pounded out its highest run total of the season, thanks to nine doubles.",
		"4" : "The Mets have scored at least five runs in seven straight games, but they have three losses in that span. On Wednesday, the extra offense was enough to overcome deGrom’s struggles as he allowed a season-high five runs while walking five batters.",

		"11" : "Flores had been out since April 20 with a staph infection in his right knee, an ailment that required intravenous fluids, antibiotics and a four-night hospital stay. “It was scary,” he said.",
		"12" : "Flores said doctors told him that he would need surgery if his infection did not improve by his second day in the hospital. But the medication reduced the swelling and eased the pain. “Everything is normal now,” he said.",
		"13" : "To make room on the roster for Flores, the Mets sent reliever Sean Gilmartin to Class AAA Las Vegas. That meant that Rafael Montero would start Friday’s game, Collins said, taking the place of the injured Noah Syndergaard, who will miss a considerable amount of time with a torn latissimus muscle.",
		"14" : "The Mets are still targeting a late May return for pitchers Steven Matz and Seth Lugo, who are recovering from elbow injuries. They hope Matt Harvey, Zack Wheeler and Robert Gsellman will round into form to help deGrom.",
		"15" : "Until then, the Mets’ offense may have to pull more than its usual weight."

		"1" : "BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox on Wednesday permanently barred from Fenway Park a man who they said used a racial slur toward another fan the previous night. It was a separate confrontation from the insults directed at Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones on Monday, but one the team said it was taking just as seriously.",
		"2" : "“I’m here to send a message, loud and clear, that the behavior, the language, the treatment of others that you’ve heard about and read about is not acceptable,” Sam Kennedy, the Red Sox’ president, said during an impromptu update for reporters in the press box during Wednesday night’s game against Baltimore.",
		"3" : "“We have to recognize that this exists in our culture; it’s not indicative of Boston,” Kennedy said, adding, “It’s a handful of ignorant and intolerant people.”",
		"4" : "One night after Jones spoke out about a fan in the Fenway stands who had used a racial slur toward him, rekindling discussions about the city’s mixed history of racial tolerance, the ballpark was the site of another racist episode.",
		"5" : "Calvin Hennick, a Boston resident taking his son to his first Red Sox game as a present for his sixth birthday, said on Wednesday night that a neighboring fan had used a racial slur when referring to the national anthem singer. Surprised, Hennick asked the fan to repeat it, and he did.",
		"6" : "Hennick summoned security, and the other fan, whose name has not been released, was ejected. Hennick said the man denied to the security officers that he had used a racial slur.",
		"7" : "Kennedy thanked Hennick, calling him courageous for speaking out. Asked if he felt inspired or emboldened by Jones’s comments a day earlier, Hennick said: “I think I would have said something anyway. I’m kind of a squeaky wheel.”",
		"8" : "Hennick added: “But I’m glad the Sox are encouraging fans to come forward. I was just pleased that they took it really seriously.”",
		"9" : "Hennick, who is white, was at the game with his father-in-law, who is originally from Haiti, and his son, who is biracial. At first, Hennick said, he assumed the other fan had mistaken him for a kindred spirit, but now Hennick believes the man was reacting to the uproar over Jones.",
		"10" : "“I was sitting there with my mixed-race family,” Hennick said. “The more I think about it, the more I think it was a deliberate thumb in the eye. He wanted to prove that he could say whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.”",
		"11" : "The Red Sox declined to identify the barred person, saying the matter had been referred to the police. The Boston Police Department confirmed that its civil rights unit was investigating and would determine whether further action was warranted.",
		"12" : "Kennedy said he believed it was the first time a fan had been barred for life from the ballpark. Ushers at the gates will be notified that the fan is not to be admitted.",
		"13" : "Kennedy said that he was angry and frustrated after the episode involving Jones but that the one involving Hennick made him feel “deep remorse that these things happen in our society.”",
		"14" : "Kennedy said the episode was “the reality of the world that we live in,” and he called on city and business leaders to “work together to try to stamp them out so that they don’t happen again.”",
		"15" : "He added, “Hopefully, this is a step forward.”",
		"16" : "Hennick said he did not feel that the experience had soured him on the ballpark or the city.",
		"17" : "“My wife and I have been happy here,” he said. “I don’t feel uncomfortable walking around Boston with my mixed-race family, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a common occurrence for people.",
		"18" : "“My son doesn’t know what happened and had a great time. He definitely wants to go back, and I plan on going back. All sports teams need to do what they can to address fan behavior, and I think the Sox kind of have a fire lit under them to make sure they do all they can.”"

		"1" : "Philadelphia Flyers forward Pierre-Edouard Bellemare rarely gets more than a few days each summer to return to his native France. He typically spends his off-season in Sweden, where he developed his game as a pro before becoming an unlikely N.H.L. rookie in 2014 at 29. Having recently bought a house in Philadelphia after three seasons with the Flyers, he expects opportunities to visit family in France will become even more scarce.",
		"2" : "Fortunately, he has been afforded a three-week business trip back home. Paris is the co-host, with Cologne, Germany, of the World Ice Hockey Championship, which begins Friday.",
		"3" : "It is an opportunity for Bellemare and his national team colleagues to play in front of friends and family while developing their sport in an emerging hockey nation.",
		"4" : "“My mom and some of my sisters have been to the world championships in different countries, but not in France,” said Bellemare, who was born in Paris. “Nobody has ever seen me play an important game in France.”",
		"5" : "One of the few French players to have earned an N.H.L. roster spot, Bellemare leads a group that is admittedly exhilarated to serve as a host nation at the worlds for the first time since 1951. But the French team, which has been at the top level of international hockey for less than a decade, is also hoping not to wilt under the pressure.",
		"6" : "For much of hockey’s history, France has been a nonentity. But it earned a measure of legitimacy in 2007 when it defeated nations like Estonia, Poland and the Netherlands at the Division I, Group A world championships to earn a promotion to the International Ice Hockey Federation’s top division. France then lost, 9-0, to Sweden at the world championships the following year in one of the more humbling defeats in the country’s nascent hockey history.",
		"7" : "But the French team avoided relegation year after year and eventually did the unthinkable. First, France defeated Russia, 2-1, in 2013. The next year France advanced to the playoff round after opening the tournament with a shocking 3-2 shootout victory against Canada.",
		"8" : "“We had to build the confidence with some positive results,” said Dave Henderson, who has coached the French national team since 2005.",
		"9" : "“Because you’re playing against better competition, your players have to play better and they have to progress. That’s what they did,” he added. “That’s what’s happening in France, not only with the senior national team but with the under-20 program and under-17 program and all through French hockey. It was sort of like a leisure thing when I first got here in 1975.”",
		"10" : "Now 65, the Canadian-born Henderson never imagined any of this when he first came to France during a college sabbatical. Without a word of French, he went to visit the grave site of his grandfather, who died during World War I near the city of Amiens. Henderson ended up playing hockey in the city before taking on the job of grooming the country into a legitimate hockey nation.",
		"11" : "That task could be greatly aided by the team’s overcoming the requisite hosting pressures to compete in a group that includes the powerhouses Canada and Finland, who won gold and silver in last year’s tournament in Russia.",
		"12" : "“We have one of the toughest groups ever since we’ve been in the world championships,” Bellemare said. “So I think guys are trying to keep it down, keep it cool, because we know it’s going to be a tough one. It’s a great opportunity.",
		"13" : "“Hockey is not a big sport in France. To get the world championships in France is a way to show the people that it’s a big thing to get a world championship in your country. That means you prove to the hockey world that you’re a hockey nation and not just trying to be a hockey nation.”",
		"14" : "Since its national team became a mainstay in the I.I.H.F.’s top division, French hockey has shown signs of development. Arenas continue to be built throughout the country and the French Cup, the national tournament featuring the country’s top pro teams, draws about 15,000 fans to its final.",
		"15" : "What’s more, France could soon see one of its own taken in the N.H.L. draft. Eligible for the 2017 draft in June, Alexandre Texier is ranked 16th among European skaters after starring in his first season with the pro team in Grenoble.",
		"16" : "There may be no greater testament to France’s growth as a hockey nation than its national team roster, which now includes a few current and former N.H.L. players. Along with Bellemare, Dallas Stars forward Antoine Roussel is expected to be a key piece for the team, which will be led onto the ice by the 41-year-old goaltender Cristobal Huet, a veteran of 289 N.H.L. games Huet was the first French player to hoist the Stanley Cup when he won it in 2010 as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks.",
		"17" : "The defense will be anchored by Yohann Auvitu, who, like Bellemare, navigated European leagues for years before making his N.H.L. debut this season at 27 with the Devils.",
		"18" : "A decade’s worth of hard work has placed France at the center of the hockey world. Now comes the real challenge: performing in front of a home crowd for the first time in 66 years.",
		"19" : "“We usually play in other countries, which is nice,” Henderson said. “But this year we’ll be at home. There will be media pressure, fan pressure, family pressure. We’ve been preparing for it. This is a special year for all of French hockey and for the players. It’s an exciting time for them.”"
