Supporters of Mr. Zuma and his governing African National Congress held smaller counterprotests in Durban and Johannesburg.", "3": "The protests were prompted by Mr. Zuma\u2019s abrupt dismissal of the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, in a midnight cabinet reshuffle last week.

Although Mr. Zuma was initially criticized by some of its top leaders for firing Mr. Gordhan, this week the A.N.C. rallied around the president.", "9": "With the party expected to select a new leader at a national conference in December, Mr. Zuma appears to have firmed up his position and influence. His critics in the party were forced to apologize this week. His cabinet is now stacked with loyalists.

For the last 16 years, Ms. Sinta has made a point of touring Indonesian cities during Ramadan, holding interfaith breaking-the-fast ceremonies to promote tolerance.", "10": "Last year, at a Catholic church in Semarang, she was confronted by a hard-line Muslim group whose members accused her of promoting the mixing of two religious traditions. The dispute was widely reported in the national news media, with the leader of the regional division of Banser, a Muslim militia with a moderate orientation, announcing that it would mobilize to protect Ms. Sinta\u2019s events in the future.", "11": "\u201cThey have to be confronted,\u201d Ms. Sinta said of the hard-liners, who tried to disrupt numerous interfaith events she headlined last year. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t, they will take heart and become even bolder.\u201d", "12": "Ms. Sinta is also in a struggle to promote women\u2019s rights.

She was educated at a local Islamic boarding school for girls, where she impressed teachers with her religiosity and academic ambition.", "21": "Mr. Wahid, a charismatic young teacher at the school whose father was the leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia\u2019s largest Muslim organization, fell in love with the outspoken and beautiful young woman, then only 13. He would visit her house after school to play chess with her father, eventually asking for permission to marry his daughter.", "22": "But Ms. Sinta told her father she was not interested. \u201cI was too young, and love hadn\u2019t blossomed yet,\u201d she said.

Ms. Sinta, who was flung from the vehicle, found herself lying in the road, unable to move.

They flew an average of 620 miles, some of them splashing down into waters inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.", "9": "When North Korea first tested its Pukguksong-2 in February, it was confident enough with the system to fire it from a mobile launch vehicle deep inside the country. The missile flew 310 miles across North Korea and fell into waters off its east coast.", "10": "The United States Pacific Command said that the missile fired on Wednesday was a Pukguksong-2 but that it had been deployed from \u201ca land-based facility\u201d near Sinpo, a port on the east coast of North Korea, rather than a mobile launch vehicle inland.", "11": "\u201cIf the missile launched on Wednesday was a failure, it\u2019s hard to believe that it involved either a Pukguksong-2 or Scud-ER,\u201d said Kim Dong-yub, a missile expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul.", "12": "Mr. Kim said it was more reasonable to believe that the North was testing a modified version of either the Scud-ER or Pukguksong-2 or a new missile, even an early version of an intercontinental ballistic missile.", "13": "When it was developing its first submarine-launched ballistic missile last year, North Korea accumulated technology incrementally, with a series of tests in which projectiles flew only short distances or exploded soon after launching, analysts said.", "14": "The United States has been conducting an electronic and cyberwarfare campaign aimed at sabotaging Pyongyang\u2019s missile tests in their opening seconds.

Unlike almost all of its other ballistic missiles, including the Scuds, that use liquid fuel \u2014 which could take hours to load, a process that can usually be detected by satellites \u2014 the Pukguksong missiles use solid-fuel technology, meaning Pyongyang can hide them in its numerous tunnels and launch them on very short notice.", "17": "When North Korea successfully launched its Pukguksong-2, Kim Jong-un boasted that his country\u2019s \u201crocket industry has radically turned into high thrust solid fuel-powered engine from liquid fuel rocket engine.\u201d That comment left many South Korean officials wondering whether the North was trying to modify its existing liquid-fuel missiles, including Scud-ERs, into versions with solid fuel.", "18": "\u201cSinpo is the birthplace of North Korea\u2019s solid-fuel technology and SLBM, and it is on the coast \u2014 and thus is a rather safer place to test a new missile whose stability is not guaranteed,\u201d said Kim Dong-yub, the missile expert. \u201cWhatever missile the North tested on Wednesday may have involved a new system and/or solid fuel.\u201d", "19": "The North\u2019s Pukguksong series signaled breakthroughs in other ways.", "20": "After several tests, North Korea said in August that it successfully launched its Pukguksong-1, claiming that the continental United States, as well as its military bases in the Pacific, were within striking range.", "21": "Analysts and defense officials said that North Korea was still years away from achieving the capability Kim Jong-un claimed. The country still does not have submarines large and advanced enough to attack distant targets across the Pacific without being detected.", "22": "After studying the Pukguksong-2 test in February, the United States Strategic Command called the missile \u201ca medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile.\u201d But North Korea used an unfamiliar term, a \u201cmedium long-range ballistic missile,\u201d suggesting its potential range would be longer.

Syrian chemical weapons were not targeted out of an apparent desire to avoid setting them into Syria\u2019s winds.", "11": "To force Mr. Assad to re-orient his strategic priorities, Ms. Talmadge said, American strikes would need to clear a daunting bar: credibly threatening the survival of the Syrian government.", "12": "\u201cWe know that regime and personal survival are what Assad cares about the most, so if the United States wants to alter his calculus, we have to threaten those priorities,\u201d Ms. Talmadge said.", "13": "This does not necessarily require bringing about leadership change, but rather some action that would significantly erode the government\u2019s ability to survive, such as heavy strikes against the capital. It could also mean so extensively destroying Syrian military infrastructure and hardware that it left Mr. Assad unable to fully defend against the opposition.", "14": "Such action would also need to threaten to overwhelm the Russian support that props up Mr. Assad. This would require either exceeding what Russian forces could match \u2014 a high bar, given the country\u2019s enormous military capabilities \u2014 or imposing costs on the Russian government that exceed whatever gain it sees in Syria.", "15": "And any effective strikes would need to do all this without provoking a response that would erase their benefits or bring intolerable costs.", "16": "These requirements mean such a plan is something like the holy grail of Syria policy, long sought but never found.", "17": "The Trump administration, in calibrating strikes, faced two bad choices.

For Russia, the survival of the Syrian government is an issue of tremendous strategic importance.", "27": "For the United States, the strategic imperative appears more modest.

Because Mr. Assad and Moscow see far higher stakes, they have shown they will go further and maintain control over the conflict.", "29": "The value of strikes, in theory, goes beyond deterring future chemical weapons use. By signaling a broader willingness to escalate, they compel Syria and Russia to voluntarily restrain their behavior for fear of stronger American action.", "30": "But this implicit threat faces the same problem as the strikes themselves. If it is credible, then it forces Mr. Assad and Moscow to both retaliate and compensate.

The country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, needed to understand that there would finally be a cost for his brutality, in this case the use of chemical weapons with sarin, a banned nerve agent, that killed scores of civilians earlier this week in one of the worst atrocities of the Syrian civil war.", "2": "But it is also hard not to feel unsettled by the many questions raised by President Trump\u2019s decision. Among them: Was it legal? Was it an impetuous, isolated response unrelated to a larger strategy for resolving the complex dilemma of Syria, a nation tormented not just by civil war but also by the fight against the Islamic State? So far, there is no evidence that Mr. Trump has thought through the implications of using military force or figured out what to do next.", "3": "For a man who had campaigned on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform of avoiding entanglements in overseas conflicts and who repeatedly warned his predecessor, Barack Obama, against military action in Syria, Mr. Trump made a breathtaking turnaround in the space of 63 hours after the chemical attack. He has long argued that the top priority was fighting the Islamic State, not forcing Mr. Assad from power; indeed, as recently as last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, had reinforced the perception that Mr. Trump was perfectly willing to live with Mr. Assad.", "4": "Mr. Trump explained the shift by saying that he had been so deeply moved by television footage of child victims gasping for breath that \u201cmy attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.\u201d However sincere this sentiment, the spectacle of a president precipitously reversing course on war and peace on the basis of emotion or what his defenders describe as \u201cinstinct\u201d does not inspire confidence.", "5": "One also has to wonder why he was not similarly moved by the 400,000 Syrians who have died since the war broke out in 2011, or by the thousands of Syrian refugees he has barred from the United States.", "6": "So what did the 59 missiles accomplish? Militarily, this was a measured response that severely damaged Syrian aircraft and infrastructure at Al Shayrat airfield. Tactically, it may help persuade Mr. Assad (and other problematic leaders, like those in North Korea) that using weapons of mass destruction will not go unpunished. But Mr. Assad still has his chemical weapons, and the civil war endures.", "7": "The airstrikes allowed Mr. Trump, whose presidency has so far been defined mainly by its stumbles, to separate himself from Mr. Obama, who threatened military action in the event of a chemical attack but who, after such an attack, chose a smarter course, a deal in which Russia guaranteed the removal of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. It is not clear whether the Kremlin failed to follow through or simply allowed Mr. Assad to retain his lethal capability. In any case, Russia deserves condemnation, as does Iran, which is also enabling Mr. Assad with military and other support.", "8": "Whether by design or not, the American military action has also shifted the focus from the scandal over Russia's interference in the election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf and allegations that the president and his allies may have colluded with Moscow. At the same time, it has made it harder for Mr. Trump to meet his goal of improving ties with Russia. Hoping to avoid a military confrontation, Washington alerted the Russians in advance of the airstrikes. Even so, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s office called the strikes a \u201csignificant blow\u201d to Russian-American relations, suspended an agreement meant to prevent accidental clashes and threatened to reinforce Syrian air defenses.", "9": "On the plus side, the airstrikes have given Mr. Trump a lift in Sunni states in the Persian Gulf, which chafed at Mr. Obama\u2019s refusal to take direct military action against Mr. Assad. European allies and members of Congress also endorsed his decision. But the action lacked authorization from Congress and the United Nations Security Council, raising questions about its legality and spotlighting a rich irony.

After Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American, died of a broken spine in police custody in 2015, a Justice Department investigation uncovered a pattern of policing in African-American neighborhoods so brutal that people were fearful of cooperating with officers.", "3": "Mr. Sessions has argued that consent decrees usurp state and local authority. But the nation\u2019s most broken police departments have proved incapable of reforming themselves  unless the federal government intervenes.", "4": "Congress came to that conclusion in 1994, when it gave the Justice Department authority to restructure troubled departments after Los Angeles erupted in riots following the acquittal of officers who were videotaped brutally beating a black motorist, Rodney King. The Justice Department became particularly aggressive with this authority under the Obama administration, which opened 23 investigations. The inquiries into Ferguson, Cleveland, Chicago and Baltimore revealed particularly barbaric and racist policing practices.", "5": "In addition to pushing police departments toward reform, these investigations have broadened awareness of the problem and prompted legislation in both Republican and Democratic states. A new report by the Vera Institute of Justice shows that in the last two years alone 34 states and the District of Columbia have enacted at least 79 bills, executive orders or resolutions pertaining to policing policy. Among other things, these states expanded the use of body cams, enhanced protections for people who record police activities and established new data-reporting requirements for police actions.", "6": "Mr. Sessions is trying to turn back the clock on a crucial reform process that has become widely accepted. The tough-guy, law-and-order mentality that he and President Trump espouse may be popular with some officers.

In the immediate aftermath of the purge, some of its senior leaders openly criticized the president\u2019s actions.

That was evidently shorthand for Mr. Gordhan\u2019s courageous resistance to Mr. Zuma\u2019s spending schemes, including a hugely expensive deal with Russia for nuclear power plants.", "5": "The A.N.C. is scheduled to elect a new leader at its conference in December, and that person is likely to become the next president when Mr. Zuma\u2019s second, and final, term ends in 2019.

This would provide a perfect opportunity for the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, to extend an olive branch in the wake of the partisan acrimony over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination.

In 1981, there were only 82 breweries in the United States, and our beer, fizzy and flavorless, was the laughingstock of the beer world. Today, America is home to over 5,300 small, innovative craft breweries making unique, flavorful, creative brews.", "2": "But we also agree that the horizon isn\u2019t so bright. After years of 15 percent growth, the craft sector is down to the single digits. Part of that is to be expected in a maturing part of any market \u2014 but it\u2019s also a result of a pushback by a handful of gargantuan global brewers, aided by slack government antitrust oversight. I worry that yet another major shift in the beer landscape is upon us \u2014 and this time, American consumers will be the losers.", "3": "We have seen a dramatic consolidation in our industry in recent years. It started in 2008 when the Department of Justice approved the creation of a duopoly in the beer industry by greenlighting a joint venture between Molson Coors and SABMiller (creating MillerCoors) and, five months later, the merger of Anheuser Busch and InBev.", "4": "Overnight, about 90 percent of domestic beer production was in the hands of two foreign-owned brewing giants. (The consolidation continued in 2016, when regulators approved the merger of SABMiller and AB InBev; SABMiller sold back its stake in MillerCoors, creating a new duopoly between Molson Coors and AB InBev.)", "5": "The immediate result was a 6 percent increase in beer prices and the end of a decades-long decline in real beer prices. Drinkers began paying almost $2 billion a year more for their beer. At least 5,000 Americans lost their jobs, and cost cutting followed, saving the new owners an estimated $2 billion. That money goes to those two foreign conglomerates that have been able to reduce their tax bills and move much of their profits offshore.", "6": "This brewer\u2019s duopoly has led to a second consolidation: wholesalers, the crucial intermediaries who distribute our beers to retailers. In 1980, there were 4,600 wholesalers in the country, and most markets had four or five competing wholesalers. Today, fewer than 3,000 remain, and in most local markets over 90 percent of the beer is controlled by distributors for these same two companies \u2014 one of which is dependent on AB InBev for most of its volume, and the other on Miller Coors.", "7": "These distributors are free to favor their primary suppliers over independent craft brewers when it comes to promotion, visibility, shelf space and marketing support. Laws passed in the 1970s to protect small \u201cmom and pop\u201d wholesalers from the big brewers are now obsolete and have the unintended consequence of creating an unfavorable balance of power \u2014 unfavorable to craft brewers and people who enjoy their beers.", "8": "The Department of Justice is allowing the damage to continue by greenlighting these two big brewers to extend their duopoly into craft beer by acquiring craft brewers. For example, in December the department approved AB InBev\u2019s acquisition of Karbach, one of the largest craft brewers in Texas, a state where AB InBev already controls 52 percent of the beer market. Drinkers buying cute-sounding brands like Goose Island or Terrapin or Ten Barrel are often unaware that these brands, some of them once independent, are now just subsidiaries of AB InBev or Molson Coors, which are not transparent about disclosing their true ownership anywhere on the bottle.", "9": "This unwillingness to use effective antitrust enforcement to protect American economic interests is in stark contrast to how the rest of the world operates. Before approving AB InBev\u2019s latest merger, antitrust authorities in China required it to sell its $1.6 billion stake in China\u2019s largest brewer back to the Chinese government at a bargain-basement price. South Africa required guarantees of lifetime employment for its citizens, and the Monopolies Commission in the European Union required divestitures by SABMiller and AB InBev to keep their new, combined market share to 9 percent.", "10": "In the United States, the AB InBev/SABMiller merger was approved with largely meaningless conduct restrictions, and the two big brewers were given a free pass to continue buying craft brewers and extending the duopoly into craft beer. When it comes to protecting American companies and workers, at least in beer, our government does make bad deals.", "11": "Of course, the obvious rejoinder is, \u201cWho cares?\u201d Goose Island still makes beer that consumers are buying, even if it is owned by AB InBev. But that misses the larger point. The growth and the excitement in the beer business is in craft, and its potential is threatened by a beer landscape that is heavily tilted toward gigantic foreign-owned conglomerates and against the independent, innovative entrants.", "12": "It matters because independent American breweries create beers for their local regions. They invest in their communities. They employ local workers. And they pay taxes \u2014 local, state and federal. American craft brewing is American manufacturing that doesn\u2019t outsource these well-paying American jobs.", "13": "Get some craft brewers really talking, and they\u2019ll tell you we are headed for a time when independent breweries can\u2019t afford to compete, can\u2019t afford the best ingredients, can\u2019t get wholesalers to support them, and can\u2019t get shelf space and draft lines.

Andrew M. Cuomo emerged from his Capitol office late Friday night to announce a deal on a $153 billion state budget that includes a plan for tuition-free education at state colleges.", "2": "Sitting in the ceremonial Red Room of the Capitol, Mr. Cuomo said he and lawmakers had come to agreement on an array of big-ticket items, including changes to the state\u2019s system of workers\u2019 compensation, a priority for Republicans, and to its juvenile justice system, a priority for his fellow Democrats; popular issues like expanding ride hailing to upstate New York; and an extension of the so-called millionaire\u2019s tax, on which Mr. Cuomo had hinged much of his 2017 agenda.", "3": "And while the budget was undeniably late, Mr. Cuomo said he was proud of it, calling it the \u201cbest work we\u2019ve done\u201d as a government.", "4": "The deal came more than six days after its midnight April 1 deadline and after the Legislature had been forced on Monday to pass emergency legislation to keep the state government operating. Days of negotiation had offered hints of a deal, but frustrations on both sides of the aisle had grown, with the Senate leaving Albany entirely on Wednesday evening. (Assembly members stayed in the capital.)", "5": "The agreement, which still requires the approval of the Assembly and the Senate, enables the governor to claim credit for brokering a deal out of a fractious legislative environment. But the agreement announced on Friday evening \u2014 long after many in the state had tuned out the frustration in Albany \u2014 also marked the inglorious end of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s streak of on-time or close to on-time budgets, something that dated to his inauguration in 2011.", "6": "Faced with what Mr. Cuomo called the threat of deep federal cuts from the Trump administration, the budget also builds in a mechanism that would allow the state to respond to cuts from Washington, financial flexibility that would allow the state\u2019s Division of the Budget to \u201ccorrect the state budget for that shortfall,\u201d he said.", "7": "For all of that uncertainty, Mr. Cuomo seemed satisfied with the \u201chardest budget\u201d he had overseen, including a longstanding priority for liberal groups: raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18, a deal that had snagged negotiations on several occasions. Under the deal announced by the governor, beginning in October 2018, many 16- and 17-year-old offenders would be processed through family court rather than criminal court.", "8": "But Mr. Cuomo had also seemingly paid a political price for the practice of putting high-profile and often politically valuable policies into the budget process, a longstanding if contentious practice in Albany. Such issues were consistently cited as stumbling blocks for a deal, particularly by Republicans, and led to several moments of stalled talks.", "9": "The governor\u2019s relationship with the Legislature as a whole was also put in sharp relief during the negotiations: Mr. Cuomo had effectively denied a raise to lawmakers last fall, and hard feelings may have carried over to this spring\u2019s talks. The Legislature was not to be paid during the so-called emergency extender budgets passed on Monday, though the governor was \u2014 something that became another sticking point during talks.", "10": "Still, the deal had more than enough to fill a news release, which was issued before the governor even finished speaking on Friday night. The college affordability plan, for instance, was a major piece of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s social agenda, announced in January alongside Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The plan\u2019s estimated price tag \u2014 some $163 million by 2019 \u2014 had been questioned, as was the number of students who might be able to use it. Initial estimates from Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office put the number in the hundreds of thousands, but another legislative analysis suggested that number could be as few as 32,000 students.", "11": "Mr. Cuomo said that statewide school aid would increase by $1.1 billion, or 4.4 percent, a larger boost than the governor had proposed but less than the Assembly had hoped for.", "12": "The deal also includes a renewal of a lapsed tax-abatement program that spurs affordable housing.", "13": "The one glaring omission from the budget bills was ethics reform, an issue that has dogged Albany for decades and shows no sign of abating.

It builds to a cataclysmic climax with keyboard-spanning outbursts.", "9": "In between the Rzewski pieces, Mr. Tao played Copland\u2019s 1941 Piano Sonata, which I\u2019ve never thought of as expressing American rage \u2014 especially the fleet second movement, which darts around like some blend of American swing and atonal pointillist writing. Leonard Bernstein captures that quality vividly in a 1947 recording I love.", "10": "It was fascinating, though, to hear Mr. Tao draw out every dissonance-statured, vehement element of the sonata while also bringing affecting tranquillity to the pensive conclusion of the last movement.", "11": "Mr. Tao\u2019s encore, not American and not raging, was ideal for this space: Debussy\u2019s prelude \u201cThe Sunken Cathedral.\u201d"}}, "58": {"title": "Review: Skittering, Creeping Music That Had Me Seeing Things", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/arts/music/review-salvatore-sciarrino-columbia-university.html?ref=todayspaper", "content": {"1": "The Casa Italiana at Columbia University, designed in the 1920s by McKim, Mead & White, has a small, tastefully opulent concert hall inspired by Renaissance Rome. Sitting there just after nightfall on Wednesday for ensemble mise-en\u2019s program of music by the contemporary Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino, my eyes at one point drifted from the players to the window.", "2": "I blinked. I could have sworn I saw, across Amsterdam Avenue, a person standing on a window ledge, braced against the jambs, outline visible against the light within, ready to jump. I almost started \u2014 Should I shout out? Disrupt the concert? \u2014 when it became clear that the figure wasn\u2019t moving. I squinted: It was a bit of scaffolding.", "3": "It\u2019s not surprising that this Hitchcockian fantasy emerged as I listened to Mr. Sciarrino\u2019s anxious, twitchy work. In a world of noise \u2014 ever more noise \u2014 he creates the opposite: sounds that skitter, creep and linger around silence. If a Beethoven symphony was one of the loudest things its original audience would have heard all year, a Sciarrino piece is often barely audible. One of his signatures is the milky tap-tap-tap of a wind instrument\u2019s keys being depressed, perceptible only because the atmosphere is otherwise so ominously still.", "4": "There are many composers of the past 50 years who have played with silence and its neighbors. But Mr. Sciarrino is distinct from the Wandelweiser school, which emerged in the early 1990s and built on John Cage and Morton Feldman\u2019s style of spacious quiet. His works, while similarly inscrutable, are not yogic or glacial or designed to direct your attention to ambient stirrings outside the music. His hush tends to be uneasy, vibrating, suffocating \u2014 that of the closet where you\u2019ve hidden while the burglar prowls the house.", "5": "Mr. Sciarrino was born in 1947 in Palermo, Italy. He turned 70 on Tuesday, and the Columbia concert was conceived as a birthday celebration, one far more modest than those organized this year for his more famous septuagenarian contemporaries, John Adams and Philip Glass.", "6": "He was something of an artistic prodigy, largely self-taught in his youth as both a painter and, starting as a preteen, a composer. He studied in Rome and taught in Milan, but for decades now he has lived and worked in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in Umbria. \u201cIt\u2019s in the middle of the town,\u201d he told The Guardian in 2014 about his studio, \u201cbut it\u2019s \u2018molto tranquillo.\u2019\u201d", "7": "Very calm \u2014 in the midst of everything: That could also describe much of his music. In \u201cIntroduzione all\u2019Oscuro,\u201d from 1981, a sudden coalescing of the 12-member ensemble leads to a sudden disintegration, and the surge serves to focus your ears on the drama of shards and whispers that follows. There\u2019s that characteristic creepy tap-tap-tap; muffled winds start to seem like forlorn church bells; a low, muted trombone sounds nocturnal, like a shadowy saxophone.", "8": "\u201cDialoghi sull\u2019Ultima Corda\u201d (2014) sets two cellists against each other in a conversation of tetchy, lonely characters, flecked with abrupt violences and slides. Arid plucks stand alongside glassy harmonics and held notes with growly burrs: Here, as in \u201cEsplorazione del Bianco III\u201d (1986), for a percussionist taking full advantage of a drum kit\u2019s resources, Mr. Sciarrino\u2019s music is colorless \u2014 white, obviously, comes to mind \u2014 but not textureless, just as water can exist as liquid, steam, snow, ice.", "9": "Seeing a performance of Monteverdi\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Incoronazione di Poppea\u201d when he was young made a deep impression on Mr. Sciarrino, and his work echoes the glamorous austerity of the earliest Italian Baroque. His operas and music dramas \u2014 those who saw it at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2001 won\u2019t soon forget a stark production of \u201cLuci Miei Traditrici,\u201d a stylized Renaissance tale of adultery and murder \u2014 were necessarily missing from Wednesday\u2019s hourlong program. They combine the tensely fluttering, flickering quality of his instrumental music with a remarkably varied approach to the human voice, sometimes speaking, sometimes keening, sometimes as pure-toned as a boy soprano.", "10": "But there was still theatricality at the Columbia concert. \u201cEsplorazione del Bianco I,\u201d from 1986, is a solo for double bass that derives much of its power from making that big, deep instrument sound so high and small. The player hunches over the bass, fingers scrawling out harmonics beyond the fingerboard: It\u2019s a visual spectacle as much as an aural one.", "11": "\u201cOmaggio a Burri\u201d (1995) was written in honor of the painter Alberto Burri, whose parched, cracked canvases have a resemblance to Mr. Sciarrino\u2019s music. It is a trio for violin, flute (for which he is one of the great modern composers) and clarinet, and that final instrument is made to be percussive \u2014 always that tap-tap-tap \u2014 while in certain passages also emitting a mellow, liquid tone of earthy color, like stout beer.", "12": "Or like blood.

But for \u201cChewing Gum,\u201d Ms. Coel invented some vivid secondary characters, and she gets crucial support from Shola Adewusi as Joy, Tracey\u2019s sanctimonious mother, and particularly Susan Wokoma as Cynthia, her catastrophically jealous and equally sex-starved sister. Cynthia is in some ways an even more original creation than Tracey, and Ms. Wokoma steals every scene she\u2019s in.", "6": "\u201cChewing Gum\u201d runs on sheer inventiveness rather than story and structure, and in the last few episodes of the second season, Ms. Coel starts to run short of ideas and drift toward the shoals of up-with-people sentimentality.", "7": "But there are episodes and moments that are the equal of the tremendous first season, like Tracey\u2019s liaison with a too-good-to-be-true guy who turns out to have an Africa fetish (\u201cBut where are you from from?\u201d) and a photo shoot with a dachshund that takes an unsavory turn.

With just a minute or so remaining at Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s BayArena on Sunday afternoon, Havertz, a teenage midfielder, and the home team were losing to Wolfsburg. Mario Gomez, the visitors\u2019 slick-haired, evergreen forward, had scored a quick-fire hat trick to overturn Leverkusen\u2019s two-goal lead.", "2": "Then, as the game ticked into its dying seconds, Karim Bellarabi lofted a pass into Havertz\u2019s path. Havertz adjusted his stride, just a little, and caught the ball as it bounced with the outside of his left foot. His shot scudded past the Wolfsburg goalkeeper and into the bottom corner, salvaging a 3-3 tie.", "3": "As he ran to the crowd to exult in the first goal of his senior career, Havertz was not the only one celebrating. In the Bundesliga\u2019s marketing department, too, there would have been no little joy. That one moment, after all, was the perfect microcosm of how the competition likes to see itself: a fresh-faced, GIF-friendly distillation of modern German soccer\u2019s vibrant self-image.", "4": "When the Bundesliga published its annual review in January, the league\u2019s chief executive, Christian Seifert, wanted to draw attention to three areas in particular. The Bundesliga boasts, he said, the youngest average age of any of Europe\u2019s major leagues. It has, he continued, the highest attendances of any soccer league in the world, behind only the N.F.L. in all sports. And those fans who swell its stadiums, he concluded, see more goals than their counterparts in Spain, Italy, England and France, and have done so for \u201cthe last 26 years.\u201d", "5": "On Sunday, Havertz\u2019s goal seemed to encapsulate all of that. He is only 17, still at school, and yet he is now widely seen as Germany\u2019s next big thing. The BayArena was not quite full, but not far off. And the game finished as a 3-3 draw. The Bundesliga could not have asked for more had league officials scripted it.", "6": "And yet there is reason to believe Germany\u2019s self-image is not exactly crystal clear. It is no lie to say the Bundesliga has better attendance than anywhere else, or that its clubs place more faith in their young hopefuls. But the goals? Well, the goals seem to be disappearing.", "7": "\u201cThe Bundesliga, historically, is the highest scoring of the big European leagues,\u201d said Simon Gleave, the head of analysis at the data company Gracenote Sports. \u201cIt has been the highest scoring every season since 1989, and has never been lower than second since its inception.", "8": "\u201cBut this season, goal scoring has declined to its lowest level for decades. The other four leagues are all experiencing an increase, so the Bundesliga is not only likely to lose its crown, but it could end the season as low as fourth of the five.\u201d", "9": "The figures themselves are not, initially, all that eye-catching: from an average of around 2.9 goals a game down to around 2.76. Gracenote\u2019s data suggests the number of shots per game has decreased marginally, down to around 22.7, and conversion rates are a little lower than is \u2014 or was \u2014 normal, too.", "10": "But while it is a subtle shift, it is also a significant one, its ramifications stretching from Germany to much further afield. \u201cIt is not a one-off,\u201d said Markus Weinzierl, the Schalke coach, scotching the idea that it is nothing more than a blip. \u201cIt is a trend.\u201d", "11": "Weinzierl said that he believed it could be traced, in part, to the improved athleticism of players and to the greater tactical sophistication of their coaches. \u201cThere are fewer goals because of individual mistakes,\u201d he said. Doubtless, that is true, but it would not explain why Germany has been uniquely afflicted, growing more parsimonious as its peers become more laissez-faire.", "12": "Perhaps, then, it is to do with style. In recent years, the Bundesliga played midwife to a philosophical approach that has swept through elite European soccer: the furious, intense pressing game pioneered by Ralf Rangnick and popularized by J\u00fcrgen Klopp.", "13": "Pressing is \u2014 as another of its disciples, Roger Schmidt, told The Times of London last year \u2014 a way for \u201cteams without as much individual quality to achieve important success.\u201d It serves to level the playing field: By depriving better teams the time and oxygen needed to showcase their abilities, lesser lights can hold their own. That two fine exponents of pressing, Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, are performing so well this year \u2014 both are likely to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions League \u2014 proves the point.", "14": "To thrive in such an asphyxiated environment, as Weinzierl said, \u201cyou need a very well-organized positional game to get deep in to the opponent\u2019s territory, and high individual class in order to create chances.\u201d", "15": "That is rather easier said than done. In Germany, in general, now \u201cyou have the whole team as a tight unit trying to win the ball aggressively from the opposition, leaving very few spaces and little time to act,\u201d Weinzierl said. \u201cThat means fewer goal-scoring opportunities, and thus fewer goals.\u201d", "16": "It may be, then, that the same doctrine that initially made German soccer so visually appealing is now starting to choke it. \u201cBut there are only a certain number of teams who play that pressing game,\u201d said Lukas Keppler, an analyst at another analytics company, Impect.", "17": "The brainchild of two players \u2014 the now-retired Stefan Reinartz and Jens Hegeler, currently with Bristol City in England \u2014 Impect was established two years ago in the belief that soccer could be doing more with its data, and with the aim of setting that right. It now works with five Bundesliga clubs, including Borussia Dortmund, as well as the German national team.", "18": "Much of its work has focused on a metric it has developed called \u201cpacking,\u201d which counts the number of players taken out of the game \u2014 outplayed, as Impect calls it \u2014 by a particular move, be it a dribble or a pass.", "19": "\u201cA lot of the traditional statistics are not relevant to performance,\u201d Keppler explained. \u201cThe team with more ball possession only wins 52 percent of the time; with more kilometers run 60 percent; and with more shots only 61 percent. We have found that the team who outplays more players than its opponent wins 88 percent of the time. The correlation is far greater.\u201d", "20": "What Impect has noted this season is that, while the likes of Bayern Munich prioritize possession, and Dortmund, Leipzig and a few others emphasize pressing, more and more teams are seeking a third way. \u201cIf you look at Eintracht Frankfurt, Cologne and Hertha Berlin, in terms of the number of opponents they are beating, their numbers are not good,\u201d Keppler said. \u201cBut if you look at the converse \u2014 how many times their players are beaten \u2014 they are top of the league.\u201d", "21": "The Bundesliga, as Seifert made clear in January, prides itself on its attacking intent. But the history of soccer has always been one of ebb and flow: When one approach becomes orthodoxy, heresy will always bring a competitive advantage.", "22": "In a league dominated for so long by the high priests of the high press, the sect of sitting deep is starting to attract followers. \u201cThese teams define themselves as only needing to score once or twice to win,\u201d Keppler said. And just as pressing proved to be contagious, so too has its counterpoint. \u201cOther teams have started to realize that it works,\u201d Keppler said.", "23": "It is not just Seifert, and the Bundesliga\u2019s marketing team, who should take note. Keppler highlights that last summer\u2019s European Championship was low scoring; Weinzierl makes the same point. It is a trend, but it may not be a localized one.", "24": "It is simply that the Bundesliga, for now, finds itself in the vanguard of fashion. Germany spread pressing around Europe.

He remains shorn for now of his top-shelf fastball, that 98-mile-per-hour heater, and that added to the fascination. We live in a strikeout age, in which the 24th man on every roster throws 96 m.p.h.

Among other rearrangements, the surgeons removed one of his ribs.", "7": "The Harvey that departed a year ago was complicated. He was a natural alpha dog who burned with ambition; he could be prickly, sarcastic and full of himself.

Even the second slot is held by Jacob deGrom, who would be an ace on most other clubs in the league.", "10": "For now the status demotion appears not to bother Harvey. He looks stripped to his essence. His body and facial puffiness of the past few years has disappeared, replaced by a physique slimmer and more cut. The Mets have preached humility to Harvey with the persistence of St. Augustine, and his brush with athletic mortality may have made it easier for him to hear them.", "11": "Manager Terry Collins is well into his seventh decade, and spoke with the perspective of a man who has seen many young men struggle to master this difficult game. \u201cHe put a smile on his face finally,\u201d he said of Harvey.", "12": "April games are curious affairs. In principle, a win or loss means as much as one in July or September, although that\u2019s not the case psychologically.

You wondered if balls that settled into outfielders\u2019 gloves in chilly April would bang against walls in July.", "18": "For now, though, to watch Harvey was a small joy.
